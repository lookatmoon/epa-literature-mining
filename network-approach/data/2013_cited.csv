Temporal patterns differ for these two engine types that are used predominantly for passenger travel and goods movement, respectively. Rapid growth in diesel fuel use and decreasing NOx emission rates from gasoline engines have led to altered emission profiles. During the 1990s, on-road use of diesel fuel grew 3 times faster than gasoline. Over the same time period, the NOx emission rate from gasoline engines in California was reduced by a factor of ~2, while the NOx emission rate from diesel engines decreased only slightly. Diesel engines therefore grew in both relative and absolute terms as a source of NOx, accounting for about half of all on-road NOx emissions as of 2000. Diesel truck emissions decrease by 60-80% on weekends. Counterintuitive responses to these emission changes are seen in measured concentrations of ozone. In contrast, elemental carbon (EC) concentrations decrease on weekends as expected. Weekly and diurnal patterns in diesel truck activity contribute to variability in the ratio of organic carbon (OC) to EC in primary source emissions, and this could be a source of bias in assessments of the importance of secondary organic aerosol."

CO emissions decreased between 56% (Denver) and 71% (Chicago), HC emissions decrease between 27% (Phoenix) and 63% (Denver), and NO emissions have dropped between 48% (West LA) and 68% (Chicago). Three observed factors common to all of the sites are that the emission reductions are occurring in vehicles of all ages, that the influence of engine load on fuel-specific emissions, especially for CO and NO, is reduced and that fleet-averaged emission deterioration is near zero for model years newer than 2001 and older than 1990. These nationwide data sets imply that the majority of these on-road emissions reductions are the result of continued improvements in function and durability of vehicle emission control systems and that inspection and maintenance and fuel reformulation programs have only played a minor role."

Analysis of these fleets shows that newer automobiles, during a period of fairly constant new car standards, have become continually less polluting independent of measurement location. Improving emissions control technology spurred by federal regulations is thought to have brought about these trends."

Carbon monoxide and nitric oxide show increasing emissions with increased altitude. Oxides of nitrogen (NOx) emissions have decreased with more recent model years over the last 10 years but are the same as vehicles that are 20 years old. At the Golden, CO site, there was a statistically significant decrease in fleet emissions of CO and NOx since a similar study in 1999. There was no emission trend for CO or NOx with gross vehicle weight or odometer in units of grams of pollutant per kilogram of fuel consumed. Data from this study suggest that on-road remote sensing can detect illegal, high sulfur fuel use from individual heavy-duty diesel trucks. Ammonia emissions from this study were below the detection limit of the instrument but will be useful as a baseline value for future comparison."

Maximum activity occurred at 30?C. Steam sterilization of the soil, the addition of antibiotics or 10 percent (by weight) saline solution, and anaerobic conditions all prevented carbon monoxide uptake. Sterilized soil inoculated with nonsterile soil acquired activity with time. Samples of various natural soils differed in their ability to remove carbon monoxide from the air. Acidic soils with a high content of organic matter were generally the most active. The soil's ability to remove carbon monoxide from the atmosphere is ascribed to the activity of soil micro-organisms."

Despite its importance, the rate coefficient remains poorly determined under tropospheric conditions because of difficulties in making laboratory rate measurements in air at 760 torr and uncertainties about a secondary channel producing peroxynitrous acid (HOONO). We combined two sensitive laser spectroscopy techniques to measure the overall rate of both channels and the partitioning between them at 25?C and 760 torr. The result is a significantly more precise value of the rate constant for the HONO2 formation channel, 9.2 (?0.4) x 10?12 cm3 molecule?1 s?1 (1 SD) at 760 torr of air, which lies toward the lower end of the previously established range. We demonstrate the impact of the revised value on photochemical model predictions of ozone concentrations in the Los Angeles airshed."

II: Experimental evidence and global impact,"Peeters, J; Muller, JF",2010.0,"A consistent body of experimental evidence from work of other groups is presented in support of the novel, theoretically based, isopreneoxidation mechanism we recently proposed to rationalize the unexpectedly high OH concentrations observed over areas with high isoprene emissions. Some explicit or implicit criticisms on the new mechanism are addressed. A particular photochemical mechanism is newly proposed for the OH-regenerating photolysis of the crucial hydroperoxy-methyl-butenals (HPALDs), formed by isomerisation of the initial isoprenehydroxy-peroxy radicals, that rationalizes a quantum yield close to 1. A similar photolysis mechanism of the resulting photolabile peroxy-acid-aldehydes (PACALDs) is shown to generate ample additional OH. Global modeling demonstrates the major importance of the new chemistry for the oxidizing capacity of the atmosphere over continents. The globally averaged yield of the HPALDs in the oxidation of isoprene by OH is estimated to be of the order of 0.6. The isomerisation reactions of isoprene peroxy radicals are found to result in modelled [OH] increases in the planetary boundary layer by up to a factor of 3, in agreement with the reported observations as in the Amazon basin."

The newly proposed chemistry could provide a rationalization for the unexpectedly high OH concentrations often observed in forested environments, such as over the Amazon forest in the recent Gabriel campaign."

The importance of OH rests on its high reactivity, its ubiquitous photochemical production in the sunlit atmosphere, and most importantly on its regeneration in the oxidation chain of the trace gases. In the current understanding, the recycling of OH proceeds through HO2 reacting with NO, thereby forming ozone. A recent field campaign in the Pearl River Delta, China, quantified tropospheric OH and HO2 concentrations and turnover rates by direct measurements. We report that concentrations of OH were three to five times greater than expected, and we propose the existence of a pathway for the regeneration of OH independent of NO, which amplifies the degradation of pollutants without producing ozone.

Once released into the atmosphere, 1,3-butadiene (BD) reacts with hydroxyl radicals and ozone (created by photochemical processes), to produce many identified and unidentified products. Once this transformation has occurred, the toxic potential of atmospheric pollutants such as BD in the ambient environment is currently unclear. During this study, environmental irradiation chambers (also called smog chambers), utilizing natural sunlight, were used to create photochemical transformations of BD. The smog chamber/in vitro exposure system was designed to investigate the toxicity of chemicals before and after photochemical reactions and to investigate interactions with the urban atmosphere using representative in vitro samples. In this study, we determined the relative toxicity and inflammatory gene expression induced by coupling smog chamber atmospheres with an in vitro system to expose human respiratory epithelial cells to BD, BDs photochemical degradation products, or the equivalent ozone generated within the photochemical mixture. Exposure to the photochemically generated products of BD (primarily acrolein, acetaldehyde, formaldehyde, furan and ozone) induced significant increases in cytotoxicity, IL-8, and IL-6 gene expression compared to a synthetic mixture of primary products that was created by injecting the correct concentrations of the detected products from the irradiation experiments. Interestingly, exposure to the equivalent levels of ozone generated during the photochemical transformation of BD did not induce the same level of inflammatory cytokine release for either exposure protocol, suggesting that the effects from ozone alone do not account for the entire response in the irradiation experiments. These results indicate that BDs full photochemical product generation and interactions, rather than ozone alone, must be carefully evaluated when investigating the possible adverse health effects to BD exposures. The research presented here takes into account that photochemical transformations of hazardous air pollutants (HAPs) does generate a dynamic exposure system and therefore provides a more realistic approach to estimate the toxicity of ambient air pollutants once they are released into the atmosphere."

BD and its 2-methyl analog, isoprene (ISO), are chemically similar but have very different toxicities, with ISO showing no significant carcinogenesis. Once released into the atmosphere, reactions with species induced by sunlight and nitrogen oxides convert BD and ISO into several photochemical reaction products. In this study, we determined the relative toxicity and inflammatory gene expression induced by exposure of A549 cells to BD, ISO, and their photochemical degradation products in the presence of nitric oxide. Gas chromatography and mass spectrometry analyses indicate the initial and major photochemical products produced during these experiments for BD are acrolein, acetaldehyde, and formaldehyde, and products for ISO are methacrolein, methyl vinyl ketone, and formaldehyde; both formed < 200 ppb of ozone. After exposure the cells were examined for cytotoxicity and interleukin-8 (IL-8) gene expression, as a marker for inflammation. These results indicate that although BD and ISO alone caused similar cytotoxicity and IL-8 responses compared with the air control, their photochemical products significantly enhanced cytotoxicity and IL-8 gene expression. This suggests that once ISO and BD are released into the environment, reactions occurring in the atmosphere transform these hydrocarbons into products that induce potentially greater adverse health effects than the emitted hydrocarbons by themselves. In addition, the data suggest that based on the carbon concentration or per carbon basis, biogenic ISO transforms into products with proinflammatory potential similar to that of BD products."

""Smog chambers"" have been used for over 30 yr to conduct experiments for developing and testing photochemical models that predict ambient ozone (O3) concentrations and aerosol chemistry. These chambers were used to generate photochemical and nonirradiated systems, which were interfaced with an in vitro exposure system to compare the inflammatory effects of complex air pollutant mixtures with and without sunlight-driven chemistry. These are preliminary experiments in a new project to study the health effects of particulate matter and associated gaseous copollutants. Briefly, two matched outdoor chambers capable of using real sunlight were utilized to generate two test atmospheres for simultaneous exposures to cultured lung cells. One chamber was used to produce a photochemically active system, which ran from sunrise to sunset, producing O3and the associated secondary products. A few hours after sunset, NO was added to titrate and remove completely the O3, forming NO2. In the second chamber, an equal amount of NO2and the same amount of the 55-component hydrocarbon mixture used to setup the photochemical system in the first side were injected. A549 cells, from an alveolar type II-like cell line grown on membranous support, were exposed to the photochemical mixture or theooriginaloNO2/hydrocarbon mixture for 5 h and analyzed for inflammatory response (IL-8 mRNA levels) 4 h postexposure. In addition, a variation of this experiment was conducted to compare the photochemical system producing O3and NO2, with a simple mixture of only the O3and NO2. Our data suggest that the photochemically altered mixtures that produced secondary products induced about two- to threefold more IL-8 mRNA than the mixture of NO2and hydrocarbons or O3. These results indicate that secondary products generated through the photochemical reactions of NOxand hydrocarbons may significantly contribute to the inflammatory responses induced by exposure to urban smog. From previous experience with relevant experiments, we know that many of these gaseous organic products would contribute to the formation of significant secondary organic particle mass in the presence of seed particles (including road dust or combustion products). In the absence of such particles, these gaseous products remained mostly as gases. These experiments show that photochemically produced gaseous products do influence the toxic responses of the cells in the absence of particles."

These experiments called attention to the role of short-lived radical sources such as formaldehyde (HCHO) and nitrous acid (HONO) in increasing ozone productivity. TRAMP instruments recorded daytime HCHO pulses as large as 32 parts per billion (ppb) originating from upwind industrial activities in the Houston Ship Channel, where in situ surface monitors detected HCHO peaks as large as 52 ppb. Moreover, Ship Channel petrochemical flares were observed to produce plumes of apparent primary HCHO. In one such combustion plume that was depleted of ozone by large emissions of oxides of nitrogen (NOx), the Piper Aztec measured a ratio of HCHO to carbon monoxide (CO) 3 times that of mobile sources. HCHO from uncounted primary sources or ozonolysis of underestimated olefin emissions could significantly increase ozone productivity in Houston beyond previous expectations. Simulations with the CAMx model show that additional emissions of HCHO from industrial flares or mobile sources can increase peak ozone in Houston by up to 30 ppb. Other findings from TexAQS II include significant concentrations of HONO throughout the day, well in excess of current air quality model predictions, with large nocturnal vertical gradients indicating a surface or near-surface source of HONO, and large concentrations of nighttime radicals (approximately30 parts per trillion [ppt] HO2). HONO may be formed heterogeneously on urban canopy or particulate matter surfaces and may be enhanced by organic aerosol of industrial or motor vehicular origin, such as through conversion of nitric acid (HNO3). Additional HONO sources may increase daytime ozone by more than 10 ppb. Improving the representation of primary and secondary HCHO and HONO in air quality models could enhance the simulated effectiveness of control strategies."

Chlorine atoms can decrease the lifetimes of gaseous elemental mercury(1) and hydrocarbons such as the greenhouse gas methane(2). Chlorine atoms also influence cycles that catalytically destroy or produce tropospheric ozone(3), a greenhouse gas potentially toxic to plant and animal life. Conversion of inorganic chloride into gaseous chlorine atom precursors within the troposphere is generally considered a coastal or marine air phenomenon(4). Here we report mid-continental observations of the chlorine atom precursor nitryl chloride at a distance of 1,400km from the nearest coastline. We observe persistent and significant nitryl chloride production relative to the consumption of its nitrogen oxide precursors. Comparison of these findings to model predictions based on aerosol and precipitation composition data from long-term monitoring networks suggests nitryl chloride production in the contiguous USA alone is at a level similar to previous global estimates for coastal and marine regions(5). We also suggest that a significant fraction of tropospheric chlorine atoms(6) may arise directly from anthropogenic pollutants."

Reactions were performed with endocyclic (-pinene and 3-carene) and exocyclic (-pinene and sabinene) alkenes in dry and humid air and in the presence of the OH radical scavengers: cyclohexane, 1-propanol, and formaldehyde. A thermal desorption particle beam mass spectrometer was used to probe the identity and volatility of SOA components, and an iodometric-spectrophotometric method was used to quantify organic peroxides. Thermal desorption profiles and mass spectra showed that the most volatile SOA components had vapor pressures similar to pinic acid and that much of the SOA consisted of less volatile species that were probably oligomeric compounds. Peroxide analyses indicated that the SOA was predominantly organic peroxides, providing evidence that the oligomers were mostly peroxyhemiacetals formed by heterogeneous reactions of hydroperoxides and aldehydes. For example, it was estimated that organic peroxides contributed ~47 and ~85% of the SOA mass formed in the - and -pinene reactions, respectively. Reactions performed with different OH radical scavengers indicated that most of the hydroperoxides were formed through the hydroperoxide channel rather than by reactions of stabilized Criegee intermediates. The effect of the OH radical scavenger on the SOA yield was also investigated, and the results were consistent with results of recent experiments and model simulations that support a mechanism based on changes in the [HO2]/[RO2] ratios. These are the first measurements of organic peroxides in monoterpene SOA, and the results have important implications for understanding the mechanisms of SOA formation and the potential effects of atmospheric aerosol particles on the environment and human health."

Experiments were conducted at typical room temperatures and air exchange rates. Limonene ozonolysis produced the highest SOA mass concentrations and linalool the lowest with ?-pinene being intermediate. Simplified empirical modeling simulations were conducted to provide insights into reaction chemistry. Assessment of variability of particle-bound reactive oxygen species (ROS) may be important in the understanding of health effects associated with particulate matter. The ROS intensities defined as ROS/SOA mass were found to be moderately correlated with the SOA densities. Greater ROS intensities were observed for the cases where ozone was in excess. ROS intensities approached a relatively constant value in the region where ozone was in deficit. The estimated initial ROS half-life time was approximately 6.5 h at room temperature suggesting the time sensitivity of ROS measurements. The ROS formed from terpenoid ozonolysis could be separated into three categories: short-lived/high reactive/volatile, semivolatile/relatively stable and nonvolatile/low reactive species based on ROS measurements under various conditions. Such physical characterization of the ROS in terms of reactivity and volatility provides some insights into the nature of ROS."

To evaluate this hypothesis we used a gridded database of western U.S. summer burned area (BA) and biomass consumed (BC) by fires between 101-125 degrees W. The fire data were compared with daytime summer O-3 mixing ratios from nine rural Clean Air Status and Trends Network (CASTNET) and National Park Service (NPS) sites. Large fire years exhibited widespread enhanced O-3. The summer BA was significantly correlated with O-3 at all sites. For each 1 million acres burned in the western U.S. during summer, we estimate that the daytime mean O-3 was enhanced across the region by 2.0 ppbv. For mean and maximum fire years, O-3 was enhanced by an average of 3.5 and 8.8 ppbv, respectively. At most Sites O-3 was significantly correlated with fires in the surrounding 5 x 5 degrees and 10 x 10 degrees regions, but not with fires in the nearest 1 x 1 degrees region, reflecting the balance between O-3 production and destruction in a high NOx environment. BC was a slightly better predictor of O-3, compared with BA. The relationship between O-3 and temperature was examined at two sites (Yellowstone and Rocky Mountain National Parks). At these two sites, high fire years were significantly warmer than low fire years; however, daytime seasonal mean temperature and O-3 were not significantly correlated.

Data taken in aircraft transects of emissions plumes from rural U.S. coal-fired power plants were used to confirm and quantify the nonlinear dependence of tropospheric ozone formation on plume NOx (NO plus NO2) concentration, which is determined by plant NOx emission rate and atmospheric dispersion. The ambient availability of reactive volatile organic compounds, principally biogenic isoprene, was also found to modulate ozone production rate and yield in these rural plumes. Differences of a factor of 2 or greater in plume ozone formation rates and yields as a function of NOx and volatile organic compound concentrations were consistently observed. These large differences suggest that consideration of power plant NOx emission rates and geographic locations in current and future U.S. ozone control strategies could substantially enhance the efficacy of NOx reductions from these sources."

Ideally, such maps would be based on a dense network of monitoring stations, but this does not exist. Instead, there are two main sources of information for dry deposition levels in the United States: one is pollution measurements at a sparse set of about 50 monitoring stations called CASTNet, and the other is the output of the regional scale air quality models, called Models-3. A related problem is the evaluation of these numerical models for air quality applications, which is crucial for control strategy selection. We develop formal methods for combining sources of information with different spatial resolutions and for the evaluation of numerical models. We specify a simple model for both the Models-3 output and the CASTNet observations in terms of the unobserved ground truth, and we estimate the model in a Bayesian way. This provides improved spatial prediction via the posterior distribution of the ground truth, allows us to validate Models-3 via the posterior predictive distribution of the CASTNet observations, and enables us to remove the bias in the Models-3 output. We apply our methods to data on SO2 concentrations, and we obtain high-resolution SO2 distributions by combining observed data with model output. We also conclude that the numerical models perform worse in areas closer to power plants, where the SO2 values are overestimated by the models."

High concentrations of tropospheric ozone are toxic, however, and have a detrimental effect on human health and ecosystem productivity. Moreover, tropospheric ozone itself acts as an effective greenhouse gas. Much of the present tropospheric ozone burden is a consequence of anthropogenic emissions of ozone precursors resulting in widespread increases in ozone concentrations since the late 1800s. At present, east Asia has the fastest-growing ozone precursor emissions. Much of the springtime east Asian pollution is exported eastwards towards western North America. Despite evidence that the exported Asian pollution produces ozone, no previous study has found a significant increase in free tropospheric ozone concentrations above the western USA since measurements began in the late 1970s. Here we compile springtime ozone measurements from many different platforms across western North America. We show a strong increase in springtime ozone mixing ratios during 1995-2008 and we have some additional evidence that a similar rate of increase in ozone mixing ratio has occurred since 1984. We find that the rate of increase in ozone mixing ratio is greatest when measurements are more heavily influenced by direct transport from Asia. Our result agrees with previous modelling studies, which indicate that global ozone concentrations should be increasing during the early part of the twenty-first century as a result of increasing precursor emissions, especially at northern mid-latitudes, with western North America being particularly sensitive to rising Asian emissions. We suggest that the observed increase in springtime background ozone mixing ratio may hinder the USA's compliance with its ozone air quality standard."

Various 12-month CMAQ simulations for the year 2002 using different sets of input emissions data are combined to delineate the contributions of background pollutants (i.e., model boundary conditions), natural emissions, anthropogenic emissions, as well as the specific impacts of lightning and wildfires. Results are compared with observations and previous air quality model simulations. Wildfires and lightning are both identified as contributing significantly to ozone levels with lightning NO(x) adding as much as 25-30 ppbV (or up to about 50%) to surface 8-h average natural O(3) mixing ratios in the southeastern U.S. Simulated wildfire emissions added more than 50 ppbV (in some cases >90%) to 8-h natural O(3) at several locations in the west. Modeling also indicates that natural emissions (including biogenic, oceanic, geogenic and fires) contributed ?40% to the annual average of total simulated fine particle mass over the eastern two-thirds of the U.S. and >40% across most of the western U.S. Biogenic emissions are the dominant source of particulate mass over the entire U.S. and wildfire emissions are secondary. Averaged over the entire modeling domain, background and natural ozone are dominant with anthropogenically derived ozone contributing up to a third of the total only during summer. Background contributions to fine particle levels are relatively insignificant in comparison. Model results are also contrasted with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) default values for natural light scattering particle concentrations to be used for regional haze regulatory decision-making. Regional differences in EPA guidance are not supported by the modeling and EPA uncertainty estimates for default values are far smaller than the modeled variability in natural particle concentrations."

Five UV-type and two chemiluminescence-type monitors were employed in this study. The results of the study indicate that in systems containing ozone, water vapor and zero air only, the UV-based monitors showed negligible effects due to humidity. On average, the UV monitors were within 0.5 percent of independently determined ozone values judged to be extremely accurate. The chemiluminescence-based monitors showed systematically higher readings than the UV monitors with added water vapor. The effect was found to be linear with water vapor concentration with an average positive deviation of 3.0 percent per percent H2O at 25 degrees C. For these measurement, ozone concentrations ranged from 85 to 320 ppbv and water concentrations from 1 to 3 percent (i.e., dew point temperatures from 9 to 24 degrees C). These results are largely in agreement with previous studies conducted to measure this interference, although the present study extends the range of water concentrations tested. Studies were also performed with a smog chamber with simulated polluted air (containing paraffinic, olefinic and aromatic hydrocarbon precursors) and varying relative humidities. Although the presence of water vapor did not appear to represent a substantial interference in these systems, a positive interference was observed with the UV monitors. This interference was likely a result of the presence of toluene and some of its aromatic photooxidation products (e.g., benzaldehyde), which can be partially removed from the reference stream by the ozone scrubber within the UV monitor. If the compound absorbs radiation at 254 nm, it is detected as ozone. However, when the results are scaled back to ambient concentrations of toluene and NO(x), the effect appears to be very minor (ca. 3 percent under the study conditions). It is concluded that under atmospheric conditions at moderate pollution and relative humidity levels, both types of instruments can give accurate measurements of the ozone concentration. These potential effects should be recognized when conducting ambient ozone measurements."

However, the ethylene-chemiluminescence FRM for O3 has been replaced by the UV photometric FEM by most state and local monitoring agencies because of its relative ease of operation. Accumulating evidence indicates that the FEM is prone to bias under the hot, humid, and stagnant conditions conducive to high O3 formation. This bias may lead to overreporting hourly O3 concentrations by as much as 20-40 ppb. Measurement bias is caused by contamination of the O3 scrubber, a problem that is not detected by dry air calibration. An adequate wet test has not been codified, although a procedure has been proposed for agency consideration. This paper includes documentation of laboratory tests quantifying specific interferant responses, collocated ambient FRM/FEM monitoring results, and smog chamber comparisons of the FRM and FEMs with alternative scrubber designs.

The study was predicated by the concern that commercially available UV absorbance O3 monitors may be subject to interference from volatile organic carbon (VOC) species that absorb light at 254 nm. To test for these and other effects, we compared simultaneous O3 measurements made by a commercial UV O3 monitor with an O3?NO chemiluminescence instrument, which is not subject to interference by VOC compounds. The comparisons were carried out in the summers of 1999 and 2000 at urban/industrial sites in Nashville and Houston, and in 2004 aboard a ship in the Gulf of Maine. In the two urban areas, we also compared the O3 measurements from these two methods with O3 measurements made by a long-path differential optical absorption spectrometer (DOAS).

In the extreme case of step changes between 0 and 90% relative humidity (RH), a large interference in the range of tens to hundreds of ppbv was found for all instruments tested, with the magnitude and sign depending on the manufacturer and model. Considering that water vapor does not absorb at the wavelength of the Hg lamp (253.7 nm) used in these instruments, another explanation is required. Based on experimental evidence and theoretical considerations, we conclude that the water vapor interference is caused by humidity effects on the transmission of uncollimated UV light through the detection cell. The ozone scrubber acts as a water reservoir, either adding or removing water from the air sample, thereby modulating the detector signal and producing a positive or negative offset. It was found for the 2B Technologies ozone monitor that use of a 1-m length of Nafion tubing just prior to the entrance to the detection cell reduces the water vapor interference to negligible levels (+/- 2 ppbv for step changes between 0 and 90% RH) while quantitatively passing ozone."

Potential interferences examined in the laboratory included water vapor, mercury, o-nitrophenol, naphthalene, p-tolualdehyde, and mixed reaction products from smog chamber simulations of urban atmospheric photochemistry. UV absorption O-3 monitors modified for humidity equilibration were also collocated with UV FEM O-3 monitors at six sites in Houston, TX, during the 2007 summer O-3 season.

For O(3), the aim here was to demonstrate the equivalence for the reference period of 8 h and 120 microg m(-3), the target value of the 3rd European Daughter Directive. For benzene, the demonstration of equivalence to the annual limit value of 5 microg m(-3) of the 2nd European Daughter Directive was examined. In the case of NO(2), the equivalence to the annual limit value of the 1st European Daughter Directive (40 microg m(-3)) was considered. Results show that the radial sampler for O(3) fails to meet the Data Quality Objective (DQO) for continuous monitoring. However, with an expanded uncertainty of less than 30%, the O(3) diffusive sampler fulfils the DQO for indicative measurements. For benzene, the Radiello sampler exposed for 7 days gave satisfying results showing the ability of the sampler to meet the DQO of the reference method. Nevertheless, the field tests should be complemented by measurements for a wider range of benzene concentrations. In the case of NO(2), all the results of the laboratory and field experiments respected the requirements necessary for the demonstration of equivalence. Overall, these findings thus show that the Radiello sampler and the MCPT are equivalent to the reference methods only for assessment of benzene and NO(2), respectively."

These detection papers incorporate indigo carmine and UV absorbers (UVAs). When exposed to ozone, the papers change color from blue to white, and the ozone concentration can be determined by measuring the reflectance of the papers. However, indigo carmine is strongly affected by UV light, thus making the papers unsuitable for outdoor ozone detection. The authors succeeded in sufficiently improving the resistance of the papers to UV light for them to be used outdoors. This was achieved by using hydrophilic UVAs, namely sodium 2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzophenone-5-sulfonate and ferulic acid. Without a UVA, the maximum measurement error of the papers derived from UV effect is approximately 290 parts per billion (ppb) x hr when one assumes 8 hr of UV exposure at low- to mid-latitudes (approximately 60 Wh/m2), and this error is too great for accurate ozone measurement. In contrast, the measurement errors of the papers with UVAs are only approximately 60-70 ppb x hr under the same conditions. Ozone measurement accuracies of these detection papers with UVAs are +/- 4.3-4.5% (coefficient of variation [CV]) at 25 degrees C and 60% relative humidity without UV effect. As a result, the improved ozone detection paper with high resistance to UV rays is suitable for outdoor ozone measurements (e.g., for detecting photochemical oxidants)."

A transparent backing thin layer silica gel chromatographic plate impregnated with 8-amino-1-naphthol-5-sulfonic acid (ANS) is used as the collection/sensor element. The plate transmittance is probed by three discrete light emitting diodes (LEDs) centered, respectively, at 442, 525, and 850 nm. The transmission of the plate changes reversibly across visible to NIR wavelengths as the RH around the plate changes; this is the basis for a limited-resolution RH sensor. The ANS on the plate reacts to form brown and pink colored products, respectively, when it reacts with NO2 and O3. The sample air impinges on the plate via an entrance nozzle. The LEDs are alternately turned on in a preprogrammed manner and the light is brought to the impregnated face of the plate by a three-legged fiber optic. The transmitted light is detected on the obverse side of the plate. The 850 nm signal provides the RH value and optionally serves as the reference measurement for the other two wavelengths; the NO2 and O3 reaction products do not absorb at this wavelength. The absorbance at 442 and 525 nm, thus referenced against 850 nm, are used to obtain NO2 and O3 concentrations from a pair of simultaneous equations. For a sampling period of 5 min, the limits of detection (LOD) based on 3 times the standard deviation of blank responses were 0.64 and 0.42 ppbv for NO2 and O3, respectively. Data obtained with collocated commercial instruments (O3 induced chemiluminescence analyzer for NO2 and UV-absorption for O3) show good agreement.

To facilitate the comparison, correlation analyses were conducted after dividing the data sets for those parameters into several classes. The strength of the correlations between DOAS and meteorological parameters was also examined to evaluate their effects on the DOAS performance. It was found that, among the four pollutant species, O(3) is the most sensitive to changes in meteorological conditions in relation with atmospheric mixing conditions. The overall results of our study indicate that open-path monitoring techniques can be used to effectively diagnose air quality and be substituted for the conventional point monitoring methods with the proper consideration of those parameters affecting the DOAS sensitivity (e.g., light level and wind speed)."

Different measures were used to quantify the degree of uniformity of PM2.5 concentrations in the urban areas characterized. It was observed that PM2.5 concentrations varied to differing degrees in the urban areas examined. Analyses of several urban areas in the Southeast indicated high correlations between site pairs and spatial uniformity in concentration fields. Considerable spatial variation was found in other regions, especially in the West. Even within urban areas in which all site pairs were highly correlated, a variable degree of heterogeneity in PM2.5 concentrations was found. Thus, even though concentrations at pairs of sites were highly correlated, their concentrations were not necessarily the same. These findings indicate that the potential for exposure misclassification errors in time-series epidemiologic studies exists. 
Implications: Epidemiologic time-series studies typically use daily 24-hr particulate matter concentrations averaged across several monitors in a city or data obtained at a central monitoring site to relate to health outcomes. If 24-hr average concentrations differ significantly across an urban area, exposure misclassification could be an important consideration when an average of ambient monitors is used as a surrogate for personal exposure. Correlation coefficients alone may not be sufficient to determine whether PM2.5 concentrations are uniform within urban areas. Exposure misclassification errors resulting from the neglect of spatial variability may contribute to uncertainties in the relative risk estimates in epidemiologic studies."

Probabilistic versions of the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) Exposure Model (pNEM) have been used to estimate the exposures of urban populations to carbon monoxide and ozone. An enhanced version of the Hazardous Air Pollutant Exposure Model (HAPEM-MS) has been used to develop city-specific estimates of exposure to benzene and other volatile organic compounds emitted by mobile sources. These models are similar in that each contains algorithms that simulate microenvironmental pollutant levels, time/activity patterns, and commuting patterns. The pNEM models also provide estimates of equivalent ventilation rate (EVR), defined as ventilation rate divided by body surface area. This paper summarizes the methods and results of selected research projects conducted since 1991 with the goal of improving pNEM, HAPEM-MS, and similar exposure models applicable to mobile source pollutants. The studies include: (1) the development of an improved algorithm for estimating EVR, (2) a field study to measure ozone levels near roadways and inside vehicles, (3) the development of an algorithm for estimating school commuting patterns, and (4) the construction of a comprehensive database containing time/activity data from ten activity diary studies."

The yearly roadside concentrations of CO and SO2 showed a well-defined decreasing trend, whereas those of NO2 and O3 exhibited the reverse trend. In most cases, the diurnal trends of the roadside concentrations were well-defined for all seasons, plus the daytime concentrations were higher than the nighttime concentrations. In contrast to the other target pollutants, the daytime O3 concentrations observed at the roadside sites were lower than those observed at the residential site, likely due to high-levels of fresh NO from traffic emissions that rapidly react with O3, thereby reducing the O3 roadside level. The Sunday roadside concentrations of CO, NO2, and SO2 were similar to or somewhat lower than the weekday concentrations. Conversely, for O3 the Sunday roadside concentrations were similar to or somewhat higher than the weekday concentrations. The higher O3 concentrations on Sunday may be due to the reduced titration from a decrease in NOx emissions under VOC-limited conditions (low VOC/NOx conditions). The monthly averages of O3 concentrations exhibited the reverse seasonal variation to the other target compounds, with peak O3 concentrations between April and June, and the second peak between August and October. It is also suggested that for O3, the 8-h standard is more stringent than the 1-h standard, while for NO2 and SO2, the 1-h standard is more stringent than the 24-h standard. The multiple regression equations obtained from the relationship between the concentrations and five meteorological parameters indicated that the number and type of meteorological variables in the equations varied according to the pollutant, monitoring station, or season."

This paper discusses the legal and scientific reasons for separating personal exposure to PM into ambient and nonambient components. It then demonstrates by several examples how well-established models and data typically obtained in exposure field studies can be used to estimate both individual and community average expo-sure to ambient-generated PM (ambient PM outdoors plus ambient PM that has infiltrated indoors), indoor-generated PM, and personal activity PM. Ambient concentrations are not highly correlated with personal exposure to nonambient PM or total PM but are highly correlated with personal exposure to ambient-generated PM. Therefore, ambient concentrations may be used in epidemiology as an appropriate surrogate for personal exposure to ambient-generated PM. Suggestions are offered as to how exposure to ambient-generated PM may be obtained and used in epidemiology and risk assessment. Implications: Exposure analysts historically have sought to determine the total personal exposure to PM of all types in all environments. The lack of correlation between this parameter and ambient PM concentration has been considered an impediment to epidemiologic studies seeking to find an association between ambient PM concentrations and health outcomes. For community, time-series epidemiology, it is necessary only that the community average personal exposure to ambient-generated PM be correlated with the ambient PM concentration. If everyone spent the same amount of time outside and in each microenvironment each day, and the air exchange rate and any forced-air ventilation that resulted in particle removal was a constant, and PM concentrations were uniform across the community, a high correlation would be expected between the PM concentration measured by a community-based PM monitor and the personal exposure of each individual to ambient-generated PM. Also, a high correla-tion would be expected between ambient concentration and the exposure surrogate of interest in epidemiology, the community average personal exposure to ambient-generated PM. For short-term panel studies, time-series should be determined for all classes of PM. For cohort studies of long-term effects, consideration must be given to the influence of possible variations in exposures to nonambient-generated PM because of differences among cities in time-location patterns (fractions of time spent outdoors), average air exchange rates, and average concentrations of indoor-generated and personal activity PM."

For particles, the strength of the personal-ambient association can differ by particle component and level of home ventilation. For gases, however, such as ozone (O3), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), and sulfur dioxide (SO2), the impact of home ventilation on personal-ambient associations is untested. We measured 24-hr personal exposures and corresponding ambient concentrations to PM2.5, sulfate (SO2-(4)), elemental carbon, O3, NO2, and SO2 for 10 nonsmoking older adults in Steubenville, Ohio. We found strong associations between ambient particle concentrations and corresponding personal exposures. In contrast, although significant, most associations between ambient gases and their corresponding exposures had low slopes and R2 values; the personal-ambient NO2 association in the fall season was moderate. For both particles and gases, personal-ambient associations were highest for individuals spending most of their time in high- compared with low-ventilated environments. Cross-pollutant models indicated that ambient particle concentrations were much better surrogates for exposure to particles than to gases. With the exception of ambient NO2 in the fall, which showed moderate associations with personal exposures, ambient gases were poor proxies for both gas and particle exposures. In combination, our results suggest that a) ventilation may be an important modifier of the magnitude of effect in time-series health studies, and b) results from time-series health studies based on 24-hr ambient concentrations are more readily interpretable for particles than for gases."

In contrast, many of the ambient gas concentrations were reasonable surrogates of personal PM2.5 exposures. 

METHODS: Personal multipollutant exposures and corresponding ambient air pollution concentrations were measured for 43 subjects living in Boston, MA. The cohort consisted of 20 healthy senior citizens and 23 schoolchildren. Simultaneous 24-hour integrated PM2.5, O3, NO2, and SO2 personal exposures and ambient concentrations were measured. All PM2.5 samples were also analyzed for SO4 (sulfate). We analyzed personal exposure and ambient concentration data using correlation and mixed model regression analyses to examine relationships among (1) ambient PM2.5 concentrations and corresponding ambient gas concentrations; (2) ambient PM2.5 and gas concentrations and their respective personal exposures; (3) ambient gas concentrations and corresponding personal PM2.5 exposures; and (4) personal PM2.5 exposures and corresponding personal gas exposures. 

RESULTS: We found substantial correlations between ambient PM2.5 concentrations and corresponding personal exposures over the course of time. Additionally, our results support the earlier finding that summertime gaseous pollutant concentrations may be better surrogates of personal PM2.5 exposures (especially personal exposures to PM2.5 of ambient origin) than they are surrogates of personal exposures to the gases themselves. 

CONCLUSIONS: Particle health effects studies that include both ambient PM2.5 and gaseous concentrations as independent variables must be analyzed carefully and interpreted cautiously, since both parameters may be serving as surrogates for PM2.5 exposures."

Indoor carbonyl concentrations were similar between the summer and winter, with the total mean winter concentration being 31.7 ppb and the total mean summer concentration being 36.6 ppb. However, the average air exchange rate was 0.9 hr(-1) during the winter and 2.6 hr(-1) during the summer. Therefore, the estimated carbonyl emission rates were significantly higher during the summer. Indoor organic acid concentrations were about twice as high during the summer as during the winter. For formic acid, the indoor winter mean was 9.8 ppb, and the summer indoor mean was 17.8 ppb. For acetic acid, the indoor winter mean was 15.5 ppb, and the summer indoor mean was 28.7 ppb. The concentrations of the polar VOCs were found to be significantly correlated with one another.

Thirty-six children from two Nashville area communities (Inglewood and Hendersonville) participated in the O3 sampling program, and 99 children provided additional timeactivity information by telephone interview. By design, this study coincided with the 1994 Nashville/Middle Tennessee Ozone Study conducted by the Southern Oxidants Study, which provided enhanced continuous ambient O3 monitoring across the Nashville area. Passive sampling estimated weekly average outdoor O3 concentrations from 0.011 to 0.030 ppm in the urban Inglewood community and from 0.015 to 0.042 ppm in suburban Hendersonville. The maximum 1- and 8-hr ambient concentrations encountered at the Hendersonville continuous monitor exceeded the levels of the 1- and 8-hr metrics for the O3 National Ambient Air Quality Standard. Weekly average personal O3 exposures ranged from 0.0013 to 0.0064 ppm (7-31% of outdoor levels). Personal O3 exposures reflected the proportional amount of time spent in indoor and outdoor environments. Air-conditioned homes displayed very low indoor O3 concentrations, and homes using open windows and fans for ventilation displayed much higher concentrations.
Implications: This study demonstrates the usefulness of passive O3 sampling technology in measuring long-term outdoor/indoor/personal exposures. The test subjects did well in following simple directions concerning accurate exposure assessment and in keeping time-activity diaries. Personal O3 exposure, in between the extremes of higher outdoor and lower indoor exposures, is a function of time spent outdoors. Clearly, those children spending more time outdoors are subject to higher O3 exposures than are their more housebound peers. Continuous State and Local Air Monitoring System O3 monitoring results substantially overestimate weeklong indoor and personal O3 exposure. Centrally air-conditioned indoor environments confer a substantial degree of protection from ambient O3 levels."

The buildings were naturally ventilated by opening the windows, or mechanically ventilated, and showed various air permeabilities. Ozone, nitrogen oxides (NO and NO2), and airborne particle (particle counts within 15 size intervals ranging from 0.3 to 15 m) concentrations were continuously monitored indoors and outdoors for two 2-week periods. The indoor humidity, temperature, CO2 concentration (an indicator of occupancy), window openings and building permeability were also measured. The temporal profiles of indoor and outdoor concentrations show ozone and nitrogen oxides behave differently: NO and NO2 indoor/outdoor concentration ratios (I/O) were found to vary in a range from 0.5 to 1, and from 0.88 to 1, respectively, but no correlation with building permeability was observed. On the contrary, I/O ratios of ozone vary in a range from 0 to 0.45 and seem to be strongly influenced by the building air-tightness: the more airtight the building envelope, the lower the ratio. Occupancy, through re-suspension of previously deposited particles and possible particle generation, strongly influences the indoor concentration level of airborne particles. However, this influence decreases with particle size, reflecting the way deposition velocities vary as a function of size. The influence of particle size on deposition and penetration across the building envelope is also discussed by analyzing the I/O ratios measured when the buildings were unoccupied, by comparing the indoor concentrations measured when the buildings were occupied and when they were not (O/U ratios), and by referring to previously published studies focussing on this topic. Except one case, I/O were found to vary in the range from 0.03 to 1.79. All O/U are greater than one and increase up to 100 with particle size. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS: Assessing children's total exposure requires the knowledge of outdoor and indoor air contaminant concentrations. The study presented here provides data on compared outdoor and indoor concentration levels in school buildings, as well as information on the parameters influencing the relationship between outdoor and indoor air quality. It may be used as a basis for estimating indoor concentrations from outdoor concentrations data, or as a first step in designing buildings sheltering children against atmospheric pollution."

We employ data collected from 1978 as reported in 41 roadside monitoring studies, encompassing more than 700 air pollutant concentration measurements, published as of June 2008. Two types of normalization, background and edge-of-road, were applied to the observed concentrations. Local regression models were specified to the concentration-distance relationship and analysis of variance was used to determine the statistical significance of trends. Using an edge-of-road normalization, almost all pollutants decay to background by 115-570 m from the edge of road; using the more standard background normalization, almost all pollutants decay to background by 160-570 m from the edge of road. Differences between the normalization methods arose due to the likely bias inherent in background normalization, since some reported background values tend to underpredict (be lower than) actual background. Changes in pollutant concentrations with increasing distance from the road fell into one of three groups: at least a 50% decrease in peak/edge-of-road concentration by 150 m, followed by consistent but gradual decay toward background (e.g., carbon monoxide, some ultrafine particulate matter number concentrations); consistent decay or change over the entire distance range (e.g., benzene, nitrogen dioxide); or no trend with distance (e.g., particulate matter mass concentrations)."

A study to characterize 1-hr multi-pollutant exposures was performed in Baltimore, MD, during the summer of 1998 and the winter of 1999, and was conducted over a 15-day period in each of the two seasons. Personal exposures were measured by a trained field technician, who wore a newly developed Roll-Around System (RAS) to measure 1-hr PM2.5 and gaseous (CO, O3, NO2, SO2, volatile organic compounds [VOCs]) exposures. One-hour O3, NO2, and SO2 personal exposures were measured using samplers developed in our laboratory, while short-term PM2.5, CO, and VOCs exposures were measured using currently available monitors. All 1-hr multi-pollutant exposures were measured while the technician performed pre-determined activities, beginning at 7:00 a.m. and ending at 7:00 p.m. of the same day. Activities were scripted to simulate activities performed by older adults (65+ years of age). Corresponding 1-hr ambient pollutant concentrations were obtained from federal or state monitoring networks. In this paper, we discuss the results from our study and present our descriptive analysis of the 1-hr personal particulate and gaseous exposure data. Personal PM2.5, O3, CO, and VOCs exposures showed substantial variability over the 12-hr sampling periods. Multiple pairwise com-parison tests showed that 1-hr personal O3 exposures were significantly lower in indoor microenvironments as compared with outdoor microenvironments. One-hour personal CO exposures measured in vehicles were significantly higher than those measured in other microenvironments. The associations between 1-hr personal exposures and corresponding ambient concentrations differed by pollutant and by microenvironment. For example, the correlation between personal PM2.5 exposures and ambient concentrations was lowest (r s = 0.36, p < 0.05) in the winter for in-door non-residential microenvironments, and was highest (r s = 0.90, p < 0.05) in the winter for in-vehicle microenvironments. For O3, the correlation between personal exposures and ambient levels was weakest in the winter for residential microenvironments (r s = 0.05, p > 0.05), and was strongest in the summer for outdoor near-roadway microenvironments (r s = 0.91, p < 0.05). Implications: Several recent studies have demonstrated associations between short-term ambient air pollutant concentrations and a variety of adverse respiratory and cardiovascular effects. Despite this, few studies have characterized short-term air pollutant exposures, and none of these studies have examined the relationship among short-term personal particulate and gaseous exposures. This paper describes a new personal ""roll-around"" monitor, which was used to measure 1-hr personal PM2.5 , CO, O3, and VOCs exposures simultaneously. In addition, this paper characterizes the magnitude and variability in 1-hr personal particulate and gaseous exposures and examines associations between these exposures and corresponding ambient levels. Results from this study could help to interpret results from epidemiologic studies and to better assess the health impacts of complex mixtures of air pollutant exposures."

The sampler measured simultaneous 24-hr integrated personal exposures to PM25, PM10, SO4 2-, O3, NO2, SO2, and exhaust-related VOCs.

Results of this study showed that longitudinal associations between ambient PM2.5 concentrations and corresponding personal exposures tended to be high in the summer (median Spearman's r = 0.74) and low in the winter (median Spearman's r = 0.25). Indoor ventilation was an important determinant of personal PM2.5 exposures and resulting personal-ambient associations. Associations between personal PM25 exposures and corresponding ambient concentrations were strongest for well-ventilated indoor environments and decreased with ventilation. This decrease was attributed to the increasing influence of indoor PM2 5 sources. Evidence for this was provided by SO4 2-measurements, which can be thought of as a tracer for ambient PM25. For SO4 2-, personal-ambient associations were strong even in poorly ventilated indoor environments, suggesting that personal exposures to PM2.5 of ambient origin are strongly associated with corresponding ambient concentrations. The results also indicated that the contribution of indoor PM2.5 sources to personal PM2.5 exposures was lowest when individuals spent the majority of their time in well-ventilated indoor environments.

Results also indicate that the potential for confounding by PM2.5 co-pollutants is limited, despite significant correlations among ambient pollutant concentrations. In contrast to ambient concentrations, PM2.5 exposures were not significantly correlated with personal exposures to PM2.5-10, PM2.5 of non-ambient origin, O3, NO2, and SO2. Since a confounder must be associated with the exposure of interest, these results provide evidence that the effects observed in the PM2.5 epidemiologic studies are unlikely to be due to confounding by the PM2.5 co-pollutants measured in this study."

Fifty-five adults, mean age 42 years, 53% men, and 39 children, mean age 11 years, 67% boys, wore two Ogawa passive samplers simultaneously: one for O3, the other for NO2 and NO. Mean outdoor pollution was measured at a regional monitoring network. Personal exposure levels were scattered; they were (on average) higher than stationary-site levels for NO and lower for NO2 and O3. In adults, 41% of the variance of personal exposure to NO2 was explained by mean stationary-site measurement levels (P<0.0001). Twenty-one percent additional variance was explained by living near a main road, not having an extractor fan over the cooker, older age, and male sex. NO and O3 personal exposures correlated poorly with stationary-site measurements. In panel studies of the health effects of air pollution, personal exposure to NO2 and NO can be measured satisfactorily by passive samplers: such measurements are necessary for NO but not for NO2. For O3, accurate personal exposure measurement remains a challenge and further technical development is required."

MATERIAL AND METHODS: A total of 158 children were recruited from December 1998 to April 2000. On average, three O3p measurements were obtained per child using passive badges. Time-activity patterns were recorded in a diary. Daily ambient ozone measurements (O3a) were obtained from the fixed station, according to children's residence. Levels of O3a and ozone, weighted by time spent in different micro-environments (O3w), were used as independent variables in order to model O3p concentrations using a mixed-effects model. RESULTS: Mean O3p was 7.8 ppb. The main variables in the model were: time spent indoors, distance between residence and fixed station, follow-up group, and two interaction terms (overall R(2)=0.50, p<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The O3w concentrations can be used as a proxy for O3p, taking into account time-activity patterns and the place of residence of asthmatic Mexican children."

We measured lung function and symptoms twice daily for one week each in fall, winter and spring; and concurrently  assessed time-activity patterns and personal exposures. Average daily personal exposures correlated with pollutant concentrations at central sites (r = 0.61 for O3, 0.63 for NO2, 0.48 for PM). Questionnaire-reported  outdoor  activity  increased  slightly  in communities/seasons  with higher pollution. Lung function differences between communities were explainable by age differences. Morning forced vital capacity (FVC) decreased significantly with increase in PM or NO2 measured over the preceding 24 hours. Morning-to-afternoon change of forced expired volume in one second (FEV1) became significantly more negative with increase in PM, NO2, or O3 on the same day. Predicted FVC or FEV1 loss on highest- vs lowest-pollution days was < 2%. Daily symptoms showed no association with current or prior 24-hour pollution, but increased with decreasing temperature. Parents' questionnaire responses suggested excess asthma and allergy in children from one polluted community while children in the other polluted community reported more symptoms, relative to the cleaner  community. We conclude that Los Angeles area children may experience slight lung function changes in association with day-to-day air quality changes, reasonably similar to responses seen by others in less polluted areas. Although short-term pollution effects appear small, they should be assessed in longitudinal lung function studies when possible, to allow maximally accurate measurement of longer-term function changes."

To address this, we studied 12 asthmatic subjects aged 9 to 16 yr, who recorded daily asthma symptoms (functional levels 0 to 5) and as-needed inhaler use during September and October 1993 in San Diego, California. Outdoor aeroallergens, O-3, and fine particle concentrations were measured at a central outdoor site, and personal 12-h daytime exposures to O-3 were measured daily. Personal O-3 differed greatly between subjects and was 27% of mean outdoor O-3. In random-effects autoregressionmodels controlling for weekend days and fungal spores, personal O-3 was associated with asthma severity: for a 90th percentile increase in O-3 (25 ppb), symptom scores increased by 25% (95% CI: 0 to 49%) and inhaler use increased by 26% (95% CI: 3 to 48%) over their averages. Outdoor 12-h O-3, but not 1-h maximum O-3, was associated with inhaler use (p lt 0.03). Fungal spores were significantly associated with symptoms (scores increased by 0.1 to 0.3/1,000 spores/m-3) and inhaler use (0.1 to 0.4 puffs/1,000 spores/m-3)across speciated groups. Pollen and fine particles (low levels) were not associated with any outcomes. These findings illustrate that the epidemiologic importance of O-3 and allergenic cofactors can be underestimated by failure to account for personal O-3 and fungal exposures."

However, these concentrations may not reflect the exposure these individuals actually experience. A previous study of ozone (O3) exposure and lung function among shoe-cleaners working in central Mexico City used fixed-site measurements from a monitoring station near the outdoor work sites as surrogates for personal exposure. The present study assesses the degree to which these estimates represented individual exposures. In 1996, personal O3 exposures of 39 shoe-cleaners working outdoors were measured using an active integrated personal sampler. Using mixed models, we assessed the relationship between measured personal O3 exposure and ambient O3 measurements from the fixed-site monitoring station. Ambient concentrations were approximately 50 parts per billion higher, on average, than personal exposures. The association between personal and ambient O3 was highly significant (mixed model slope p < 0.0001). The personal/ambient ratio was not constant, so use of the outdoor monitor would not be appropriate to rank O3 exposure and evaluate health effects between workers. However, the strong within-worker longitudinal association validates previous findings associating day-to-day changes in fixed-site O3 levels with adverse health effects among these shoe-cleaners and suggests fixed-site O3 monitors may adequately estimate exposure for other repeated-measure health studies of outdoor workers."

Strong correlations among numerous ambient pollutant concentrations, however, have made it difficult to determine the relative contribution of each pollutant to a given health outcome and have led to criticism that health effect estimates for particulate matter may be biased due to confounding. In the current study we used data collected from a multipollutant exposure study conducted in Baltimore, Maryland, during both the summer and winter to address the potential for confounding further. Twenty-four-hour personal exposures and corresponding ambient concentrations to fine particulate matter (PM2.5), ozone, nitrogen dioxide, sulfur dioxide, and carbon monoxide were measured for 56 subjects. Results from correlation and regression analyses showed that personal PM2.5 and gaseous air pollutant exposures were generally not correlated, as only 9 of the 178 individual-specific pairwise correlations were significant. Similarly, ambient concentrations were not associated with their corresponding personal exposures for any of the pollutants, except for PM2.5, which had significant associations during both seasons (p < 0.0001). Ambient gaseous concentrations were, however, strongly associated with personal PM2.5 exposures. The strongest associations were shown between ambient O3 and personal PM2.5 (p < 0.0001 during both seasons). These results indicate that ambient PM2.5 concentrations are suitable surrogates for personal PM2.5 exposures and that ambient gaseous concentrations are surrogates, as opposed to confounders, of PM2.5. These findings suggest that the use of multiple pollutant models in epidemiologic studies of PM2.5 may not be suitable and that health effects attributed to the ambient gases may actually be a result of exposures to PM2.5."

Of 224 children contained in the original data set, 160 children were found to have longitudinal measurements of O3 concentrations in at least six months of 12 months of the study period. Data for these children were randomly split into two equal sets: one for model development and the other for model validation. Mixed models with various variance-covariance structures were developed to evaluate statistically important predictors for chronic personal ozone exposures. Model predictions were then validated against the field measurements using an empirical best-linear unbiased prediction technique. The results of model fitting showed that the most important predictors for personal ozone exposure include indoor O3 concentration, central ambient O3 concentration, outdoor O3 concentration, season, gender, outdoor time, house fan usage, and the presence of a gas range in the house. Hierarchical models of personal O3 concentrations indicate the following levels of explanatory power for each of the predictive models: indoor and outdoor O3 concentrations plus questionnaire variables, central and indoor O3 concentrations plus questionnaire variables, indoor O3 concentrations plus questionnaire variables, central O3 concentrations plus questionnaire variables, and questionnaire data alone on time activity and housing characteristics. These results provide important information on key predictors of chronic human exposures to ambient O3 for children and offer insights into how to reliably and cost-effectively predict personal O3 exposures in the future. Furthermore, the techniques and findings derived from this study also have strong implications for selecting the most reliable and cost-effective exposure study design and modeling approaches for other ambient pollutants, such as fine particulate matter and selected urban air toxics."

The impact of regional, local (point and mobile), and personal sources on pollutant concentrations and the role of physical and human factors that might influence these concentrations were investigated. A combination of active and passive sampling methodologies were employed in the collection of PM mass, criteria gases, semivolatile organics, and volatile organic compound air pollutants among others. Monitoring was conducted in six selected neighborhoods along with one community site using a repeated measure design. Households from each of the selected communities were monitored for 5 consecutive days in the winter and again in the summer. Household, participant and a variety of other surveys were utilized to better understand human and household factors that might affect the impact of ambient-based pollution sources upon personal and residential locations. A randomized recruitment strategy was successful in enrolling nearly 140 participants over the course of the study.

Twenty-four hour ozone measurements were made simultaneously at a home and at a community central site monitor on two occasions between February and November 1994. Homes were geo-coded, and local residential nitrogen oxides (NOx) above regional background due to nearby traffic at each participant's home were estimated using a line source dispersion model. Measured home ozone declined in a predictable manner as modeled residential NOx increased. NOx modeled from local traffic near homes accounted for variation in ozone concentrations of as much as 17 parts per billion. We conclude that residential ozone concentrations may be over- or underestimated by measurements at a community monitor, depending on the variation in local traffic in the community. These findings may have implications for studies of health effects of traffic-related pollutants."

We examined the potential contribution of exposure to ozone to the risk of death from cardiopulmonary causes and specifically to death from respiratory causes. 

Methods: Data from the study cohort of the American Cancer Society Cancer Prevention Study II were correlated with air-pollution data from 96 metropolitan statistical areas in the United States. Data were analyzed from 448,850 subjects, with 118,777 deaths in an 18-year follow-up period. Data on daily maximum ozone concentrations were obtained from April 1 to September 30 for the years 1977 through 2000. Data on concentrations of fine particulate matter (particles that are 2.5 ?m in aerodynamic diameter [PM2.5]) were obtained for the years 1999 and 2000. Associations between ozone concentrations and the risk of death were evaluated with the use of standard and multilevel Cox regression models. 

Results: In single-pollutant models, increased concentrations of either PM2.5 or ozone were significantly associated with an increased risk of death from cardiopulmonary causes. In two-pollutant models, PM2.5 was associated with the risk of death from cardiovascular causes, whereas ozone was associated with the risk of death from respiratory causes. The estimated relative risk of death from respiratory causes that was associated with an increment in ozone concentration of 10 ppb was 1.040 (95% confidence interval, 1.010 to 1.067). The association of ozone with the risk of death from respiratory causes was insensitive to adjustment for confounders and to the type of statistical model used. 

Conclusions: In this large study, we were not able to detect an effect of ozone on the risk of death from cardiovascular causes when the concentration of PM2.5 was taken into account. We did, however, demonstrate a significant increase in the risk of death from respiratory causes in association with an increase in ozone concentration."

Methods--In this prospective study, we recruited 1759 children (average age, 10 years) from schools in 12 southern California communities and measured lung function annually for eight years. The rate of attrition was approximately 10 percent per year. The communities represented a wide range of ambient exposures to ozone, acid vapor, nitrogen dioxide, and particulate matter. Linear regression was used to examine the relationship of air pollution to the forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) and other spirometric measures. Results--Over the eight-year period, deficits in the growth of FEV1 were associated with exposure to nitrogen dioxide (P=0.005), acid vapor (P=0.004), particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter of less than 2.5 Am (PM2.5) (P=0.04), and elemental carbon (P=0.007), even after adjustment for several potential confounders and effect modifiers. Associations were also observed for other spirometric measures. Exposure to pollutants was associated with clinically and statistically significant deficits in the FEV1 attained at the age of 18 years. For example, the estimated proportion of 18-year-old subjects with a low FEV1 (defined as a ratio of observed to expected FEV1 of less than 80 percent) was 4.9 times as great at the highest level of exposure to PM2.5 as at the lowest level of exposure (7.9 percent vs. 1.6 percent, P=0.002). Conclusions--The results of this study indicate that current levels of air pollution have chronic, adverse effects on lung development in children from the age of 10 to 18 years, leading to clinically significant deficits in attained FEV1 as children reach adulthood."

We sought to assess the association between chronic outdoor air pollution exposure, as measured by 12-month averages by county, and asthma among children in metropolitan areas across the nation. METHODS: Eligible children included those aged 3-17 years residing in US metropolitan areas who were sampled in the 2001-2004 National Health Interview Survey (N=34,073). 12-month average air pollutant levels for sulfur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide, ozone and particulate matter were compiled by county for 2000-2004. Eligible children were linked to pollutant levels for the previous 12 months for their county of residence. Adjusted odds ratios of having current asthma or an asthma attack in the past 12 months were estimated in single pollutant logistic regression models. RESULTS: Children in counties with ozone and, to a less consistent degree, particulate matter levels in the highest quartile were more likely to have current asthma and/or a recent asthma attack than children residing in counties with the lowest pollution levels; the adjusted odds for current asthma for the highest quartile of estimated ozone exposure was 1.56 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.15, 2.10) and for recent asthma attack 1.38 (95% CI: 0.99, 1.91). No associations were found with sulfur dioxide or nitrogen dioxide levels. CONCLUSION: Although the current US standard for ozone is based on short-term exposure, this cross-sectional study suggests that chronic (12-month) exposure to ozone and particles is related to asthma outcomes among children in metropolitan areas throughout the US."

However, these reactions can also occur on indoor surfaces, especially for low-volatility organics. Conversion rates of ozone with ?-terpineol, a representative low-volatility compound, were quantified on surfaces that mimic indoor substrates. Rates were measured for ?-terpineol adsorbed to beads of glass, polyvinylchloride (PVC), and dry latex paint, in a plug flow reactor. A newly defined second-order surface reaction rate coefficient, k(2), was derived from the flow reactor model. The value of k(2) ranged from 0.68 ? 10(-14) cm(4)s(-1)molecule(-1) for ?-terpineol adsorbed to PVC to 3.17 ? 10(-14) cm(4)s(-1)molecule(-1) for glass, but was insensitive to relative humidity. Further, k(2) is only weakly influenced by the adsorbed mass but instead appears to be more strongly related to the interfacial activity ?-terpineol. The minimum reaction probability ranged from 3.79 ? 10(-6) for glass at 20% RH to 6.75 ? 10(-5) for PVC at 50% RH. The combination of high equilibrium surface coverage and high reactivity for ?-terpineol suggests that surface conversion rates are fast enough to compete with or even overwhelm other removal mechanisms in buildings such as gas-phase conversion and air exchange."

Investigations into these complaints have ascribed the effects to volatile organic compounds (VOCs) emitted from building materials, cleaning formulations, or other consumer products. New compounds can result when the VOCs react with hydroxyl or nitrate radicals or ozone present in indoor environments. Several oxygenated organic compounds, such as glyoxal, methylglyoxal, glycolaldehyde, and diacetyl, have been identified as possible reaction products of indoor environment chemistry. Although research has previously identified diacetyl and glyoxal as sensitizers, additional experiments were conducted in these studies to further classify their sensitization potential. Sensitization potential of these four compounds was assessed using quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) programs. Derek for Windows and National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health logistic regression predicted all compounds to be sensitizers, while TOPKAT 6.2 predicted all compounds except for methylglyoxal. All compounds were tested in a combined irritancy and local lymph node assay (LLNA). All compounds except for glyoxal were found to be irritants and all tested positive in the LLNA with EC3 values ranging from 0.42 to 1.9%. Methylglyoxal significantly increased both the B220(+) and IgE(+)B220(+) cell populations in the draining lymph nodes and total serum IgE levels. The four compounds generated by indoor air chemistry were predicted by QSAR and animal modeling to be sensitizers, with the potential for methylglyoxal to induce IgE. The identification of these compounds as sensitizers may help to explain some of the health effects associated with indoor air complaints."

Because human activities impact the timing, location, and degree of pollutant exposure, they play a key role in explaining exposure variation. This fact has motivated the collection of activity pattern data for their specific use in exposure assessments. The largest of these recent efforts is the National Human Activity Pattern Survey (NHAPS), a 2-year probability-based telephone survey (n=9386) of exposure-related human activities in the United States (U.S.) sponsored by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). The primary purpose of NHAPS was to provide comprehensive and current exposure information over broad geographical and temporal scales, particularly for use in probabilistic population exposure models. NHAPS was conducted on a virtually daily basis from late September 1992 through September 1994 by the University of Maryland's Survey Research Center using a computer-assisted telephone interview instrument (CATI) to collect 24-h retrospective diaries and answers to a number of personal and exposure-related questions from each respondent. The resulting diary records contain beginning and ending times for each distinct combination of location and activity occurring on the diary day (i.e., each microenvironment). Between 340 and 1713 respondents of all ages were interviewed in each of the 10 EPA regions across the 48 contiguous states. Interviews were completed in 63% of the households contacted. NHAPS respondents reported spending an average of 87% of their time in enclosed buildings and about 6% of their time in enclosed vehicles. These proportions are fairly constant across the various regions of the U.S. and Canada and for the California population between the late 1980s, when the California Air Resources Board (CARB) sponsored a state-wide activity pattern study, and the mid-1990s, when NHAPS was conducted. However, the number of people exposed to environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) in California seems to have decreased over the same time period, where exposure is determined by the reported time spent with a smoker. In both California and the entire nation, the most time spent exposed to ETS was reported to take place in residential locations."

The prevalence of change in outdoor activity due to media alerts was 31% among adults with lifetime asthma and 16% without asthma. The prevalence of outdoor activity change increased to 75% among those with lifetime asthma and to 68% without asthma, when the combined the effects of media alerts and individual perception were examined.

Objectives: Heat and air pollution advisory systems are in place in many cities for early detection and response to reduce health consequences, or severity of adverse conditions. Where as the ability to forecast heat waves and/or air pollution episodes has become increasingly sophisticated and accurate, little is known about the effectiveness of advisories in altering public behavior. Methods: Air quality and meteorological conditions were measured during advisory and control days in Portland, OR and Houston, TX in 2005 and 2006 and 1962 subjects were interviewed by telephone about their perception and response to these conditions. Results: Elevated ambient temperatures were accurately recognized regardless of air conditioning use; respondents resorted to active cooling behavior (AC, fan, etc.), while in Houston no such in Portland, change was observed. More heat-related symptoms were reported in Portland compared to Houston, probably due to low air conditioning use in the northwest. One-third of study participants were aware of air quality advisories but only similar to 10-15% claimed to have changed activities during such an episode. Not the advisory, however, drove their behavior change, but rather the perception of poor air quality, which was not related to PM2.5 or ozone measurements. Conclusions: Messages are not reaching the public during potentially hazardous weather and air quality conditions. Climatic forecasts are increasingly predictive but public agencies fail to mount an appropriate outreach response. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved."

Photochemical modeling and ambient monitoring of ground-level ozone concentrations provide two alternative/complementary methods for calculating potential population exposure estimates. A comparative evaluation of these methods was undertaken over a study area comprised of the entire state of New Jersey and neighboring parts of Delaware, Maryland, Pennsylvania and New York. Kriging, a geostatistical interpolation technique, was used for the interpolation of hourly ozone data from 38 air quality monitoring stations operating within the study area, to derive concentration fields for the entire domain. The Urban Airshed Model(UAM-IV), a comprehensive photochemical grid-based model, was then used to calculate the same concentrations from emissions and meteorology inputs. Concentration fields, thus developed were linked with corresponding population data to calculate potential population exposure estimates to outdoor ozone (E(p,o)). The adequacy of kriging as an interpolation technique was evaluated by comparing E(p,o) estimates derived via photochemical UAM modeling with those calculated by using concentrations obtained from kriging UAM-calculated values at the locations of the monitoring stations. In general, UAM was found to predict higher E(p,o)compared to those derived by kriging observations. In order to test the robustness of the interpolation methodology with respect to assumptions of statistical correlation, two different semivariogram models, spherical and exponential, were used for kriging. Application of the different semivariograms yielded almost identical E(p,o) patterns."

However air quality modeling systems have the potential to alleviate some, although not all, of the limitations of monitoring networks. To investigate this application, exposure estimates were generated for a case study high ozone episode in the Northern Georgia Region of the United States based on measurements and concentration estimates from an air quality modeling system. Hourly estimates for 2268 4-km by 4-km gridcells were generated in a domain that includes only eight ozone monitors. Individual and population-based ozone exposures were estimated using multiple approaches, including area-weighted average of modeled estimates, nearest monitor, and spatial interpolation by inverse distance weighting and kriging. Results based on concentration fields from the air quality modeling system revealed spatial heterogeneity that was obscured by approaches based on the monitoring network. With some techniques, such as spatial interpolation, monitoring data alone was insufficient to estimate exposure for certain areas, especially for rural populations. For locations far from ozone monitors, the estimates from the nearest monitor approach tended to overestimate exposure, compared to modeled estimates. Counties in which one or more monitors were present had statistically higher population density and modeled ozone estimates than did counties without monitors (p-value < 0.05). This work demonstrates the use of air quality modeling to generate higher spatial and temporal resolution exposure estimates, and compares the advantages of this approach to traditional methods that use monitoring data alone. The air quality modeling method faces its own limitations, such as the need to thoroughly evaluate concentration estimates and the use of ambient levels rather than personal exposure.

The objective of this article is to briefly summarize the history and application of LUR models to date outlining similarities and differences of the variables included in the model, model development, and model validation. There were 6 studies available for a total of 12 LUR models. Our findings indicated that among these studies, the four primary classes of variables used were road type, traffic count, elevation, and land cover. Of these four, traffic count was generally the most important. The model R2 explaining the variability in the exposure estimates for these LUR models ranged from .54 to .81.

This requires the ability to extrapolate from monitoring stations to unsampled locations. The aim was to assess methods to develop accurate and high resolution maps of background air pollution across the EU. Methods: We compared the validity of ordinary kriging, universal kriging and regression mapping in developing EU-wide maps of air pollution on a I x 1 km resolution. Predictions were made for the year 2001 for nitrogen dioxide (NO2), fine particles <10 mu m (PM10), ozone (O-3), sulphur dioxide (SO2) and carbon monoxide (CO) using routine monitoring data in Airbase. Predictor variables from EU-wide databases were land use, road traffic, population density, meteorology, altitude, topography and distance to sea. Models were developed for the global, rural and urban scale separately. The best method to model concentrations was selected on the basis of predefined performance measures (R-2, Root Mean Square Error (RMSE)). Results: For NO2, PM10 and O-3 universal kriging performed better than regression mapping and ordinary kriging. Validation of the final universal kriging estimates with results from all validation sites gave e-values and RMSE-values of 0.61 and 6.73 mu g/m(3) for NO2; 0.45 and 5.19 mu g/m(3) for PM10; and 0.70 and 7.69 mu g/m(3) for O-3.

Identical surveys and methodology were used to collect this data: random sample telephone selection within the identified telephone exchanges, computer-assisted telephone interviews, overselection of children and weekends in the 24-h recall diary and the same interviewers. Very similar response rates were obtained: 63% (NHAPS) and 64.5% (CHAPS). Results of comparisons by age within major activity and location groups suggest activity and location patterns are very similar (most differences being less than 1% or 14 min in a 24-h day) with the exception of seasonal differences. Canadians spend less time outdoors in winter and less time indoors in summer than their U.S. counterparts. When exposure assessments use time of year or outdoor/indoor exposure gradients, these differences may result in significant differences in exposure assessments. Otherwise, the 24-h time activity patterns of North Americans are remarkably similar and use of the combined data set for some exposure assessments may be feasible."

SHEDS-PM is a probabilistic model that estimates the population distribution of total PM exposures by randomly sampling from various input distributions. A mass balance equation is used to calculate indoor PM concentrations for the residential microenvironment from ambient outdoor PM concentrations and physical factor data (e.g., air exchange, penetration, deposition), as well as emission strengths for indoor PM sources (e.g., smoking, cooking). PM concentrations in nonresidential microenvironments are calculated using equations developed from regression analysis of available indoor and outdoor measurement data for vehicles, offices, schools, stores, and restaurants/bars. Additional model inputs include demographic data for the population being modeled and human activity pattern data from EPA's Consolidated Human Activity Database (CHAD). Model outputs include distributions of daily total PM exposures in various microenvironments (indoors, in vehicles, outdoors), and the contribution from PM of ambient origin to daily total PM exposures in these microenvironments. SHEDS-PM has been applied to the population of Philadelphia using spatially and temporally interpolated ambient PM2.5 measurements from 1992u1993 and 1990 US Census data for each census tract in Philadelphia. The resulting distributions showed substantial variability in daily total PM2.5 exposures for the population of Philadelphia (median=20 Ag/m3; 90th percentile=59 Ag/m3). Variability in human activities, and the presence of indoor-residential sources in particular, contributed to the observed variability in total PM2.5 exposures. The uncertainty in the estimated population distribution for total PM2.5 exposures was highest at the upper end of the distribution and revealed the importance of including estimates of input uncertainty in population exposure models. The distributions of daily microenvironmental PM2.5 exposures (exposures due to time spent in various microenvironments) indicated that indoor-residential PM2.5 exposures (median=13 Ag/m3) had the greatest influence on total PM2.5 exposures compared to the other microenvironments. The distribution of daily exposures to PM2.5 of ambient origin was less variable across the population than the distribution of daily total PM2.5 exposures (median=7 Ag/m3; 90th percentile=18 Ag/m3) and similar to the distribution of ambient outdoor PM2.5 concentrations. This result suggests that human activity patterns did not have as strong an influence on ambient PM2.5 exposures as was observed for exposure to other PM2.5 sources. For most of the simulated population, exposure to PM2.5 of ambient origin contributed a significant percent of the daily total PM2.5 exposures (median=37.5%), especially for the segment of the population without exposure to environmental tobacco smoke in the residence (median=46.4%). Development of the SHEDS-PM model using the Philadelphia PM2.5 case study also provided useful insights into the limitations of currently available data for use in population exposure models. In addition, data needs for improving inputs to the SHEDS-PM model, reducing uncertainty and further refinement of the model structure, were identified."

The AER, which is the airflow into and out of a building, is a primary mechanism for entry of outdoor air pollutants and removal of indoor source emissions. The mechanistic Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory (LBL) AER model was linked to a leakage area model to predict AER from questionnaires and meteorology. The LBL model was also extended to include natural ventilation (LBLX). Using literature-reported parameter values, AER predictions from LBL and LBLX models were compared to data from 642 daily AER measurements across 31 detached homes in central North Carolina, with corresponding questionnaires and meteorological observations. Data was collected on seven consecutive days during each of four consecutive seasons. For the individual model-predicted and measured AER, the median absolute difference was 43% (0.17 h(-1)) and 40% (0.17 h(-1)) for the LBL and LBLX models, respectively. Additionally, a literature-reported empirical scale factor (SF) AER model was evaluated, which showed a median absolute difference of 50% (0.25 h(-1)). The capability of the LBL, LBLX, and SF models could help reduce the AER uncertainty in air pollution exposure models used to develop exposure metrics for health studies."

However, most of the available data on human activities are from cross-sectional surveys that typically sample 1 day per person. A procedure is needed for combining cross-sectional activity data into multiple-day (longitudinal) sequences that can capture day-to-day variability in human exposures. Properly accounting for intra- and interindividual variability in these sequences can have a significant effect on exposure estimates and on the resulting health risk assessments. This paper describes a new method of developing such longitudinal sequences, based on ranking 1-day activity diaries with respect to a user-chosen key variable. Two statistics, ""D"" and ""A"", are targeted. The D statistic reflects the relative importance of within- and between-person variance with respect to the key variable. The A statistic quantifies the day-to-day (lag-one) autocorrelation. The user selects appropriate target values for both D and A. The new method then stochastically assembles longitudinal diaries that collectively meet these targets. On the basis of numerous simulations, the D and A targets are closely attained for exposure analysis periods >30 days in duration, and reasonably well for shorter simulation periods. Longitudinal diary data from a field study suggest that D and A are stable over time, and perhaps over cohorts as well. The new method can be used with any cohort definitions and diary pool assignments, making it easily adaptable to most exposure models. Implementation of the new method in its basic form is described, and various extensions beyond the basic form are discussed."

The study focused on a 2-week episode, 11-24 July 1999, and employed the new integrated and mechanistically consistent source-to-dose modeling framework of MENTOR/SHEDS (Modeling Environment for Total Risk studies/Stochastic Human Exposure and Dose Simulation). The MENTOR/SHEDS application presented here consists of four components involved in estimating population exposure/dose: (1) calculation of ambient outdoor concentrations using emission-based photochemical modeling, (2) spatiotemporal interpolation for developing census-tract level outdoor concentration fields, (3) calculation of microenvironmental concentrations that match activity patterns of the individuals in the population of each census tract in the study area, and (4) population-based dosimetry modeling. It was found that the 50th percentiles of calculated microenvironmental concentrations of PM2.5 and O3 were significantly correlated with census-tract level outdoor concentrations, respectively. However, while the 95th percentiles of O3 microenvironmental concentrations were strongly correlated with outdoor concentrations, this was not the case for PM2.5. By further examining the modeled estimates of the 24-h aggregated PM2.5 and O3 doses, it was found that indoor PM2.5 sources dominated the contributions to the total PM2.5 doses for the upper 5 percentiles, Environmental Tobacco Smoking (ETS) being the most significant source while O3 doses due to time spent outdoors dominated the contributions to the total O3 doses for the upper 5 percentiles. The MENTOR/SHEDS system presented in this study is capable of estimating intake dose based on activity level and inhalation rate, thus completing the source-to-dose modeling sequence. The MENTOR/SHEDS system also utilizes a consistent basis of source characterization, exposure factors, and human activity patterns in conducting population exposure assessment of multiple co-occurring air pollutants, and this constitutes a primary distinction from previous studies of population exposure assessment, where different exposure factors and activity patterns would be used for different pollutants. Future work will focus on incorporating the effects of commuting patterns on population exposure/dose assessments as well as on extending the MENTOR/SHEDS applications to seasonal/annual studies and to other areas in the U.S."

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's Office of Research and Development, National Exposure Research Laboratory (NERL) and collaborators are developing and applying tools (models, data, methods) for enhancing cumulative risk assessments. The NERL's ""Cumulative Communities Research Program"" focuses on key science questions: (1) How to systematically identify and prioritize key chemical stressors within a given community?; (2) How to develop estimates of exposure to multiple stressors for individuals in epidemiologic studies?; and (3) What tools can be used to assess community-level distributions of exposures for the development and evaluation of the effectiveness of risk reduction strategies? This paper provides community partners and scientific researchers with an understanding of the NERL research program and other efforts to address cumulative community risks; and key research needs and opportunities. Some initial findings include the following: (1) Many useful tools exist for components of risk assessment, but need to be developed collaboratively with end users and made more comprehensive and user-friendly for practical application; (2) Tools for quantifying cumulative risks and impact of community risk reduction activities are also needed; (3) More data are needed to assess community- and individual-level exposures, and to link exposure-related information with health effects; and (4) Additional research is needed to incorporate risk-modifying factors (""non-chemical stressors"") into cumulative risk assessments.

The definition of this effect depends upon the study design, disease model parameterization, and the type of analysis. Further limitations are imposed by the nature of exposure and our ability to measure it. We define a plausible exposure model for air pollutants that are relatively nonreactive and discuss how exposure varies. We discuss plausible disease models and show how their parameterizations are affected by different exposure partitions and by different study designs. We then discuss a measurement model conditional on ambient concentrations and incorporate this into the disease model. We use simulation studies to show the impact of a range of exposure model assumptions on estimation of the health effect in the ecologic time series design. This design only uses information from the time-varying ambient source exposure. When ambient and nonambient sources are independent, exposure variation due to nonambient source exposures behaves like Berkson measurement error and does not bias the effect estimates. Variation in the population attenuation of ambient concentrations over time does bias the estimates with the bias being either positive or negative depending upon the association of this parameter with ambient pollution. It is not realistic to substitute measured average personal exposures into time series studies because so much of the variation in personal exposures comes from nonambient sources that do not contribute information in the time series design. We conclude that general statements about the implications of measurement error need to be conditioned on the health effect study design and the health effect parameter to be estimated."

For many agents of interest, exposures take place over time and in multiple locations; accurately estimating the relevant exposures for an individual participant in epidemiologic studies is often daunting, particularly within the limits set by feasibility, participant burden, and cost. Researchers have taken steps to deal with the consequences of measurement error by limiting the degree of error through a study's design, estimating the degree of error using a nested validation study, and by adjusting for measurement error in statistical analyses. In this paper, we address measurement error in observational studies of air pollution and health. Because measurement error may have substantial implications for interpreting epidemiologic studies on air pollution, particularly the time-series analyses, we developed a systematic conceptual formulation of the problem of measurement error in epidemiologic studies of air pollution and then considered the consequences within this formulation. When possible, we used available relevant data to make simple estimates of measurement error effects. This paper provides an overview of measurement errors in linear regression, distinguishing two extremes of a continuum-Berkson from classical type errors, and the univariate from the multivariate predictor case. We then propose one conceptual framework for the evaluation of measurement errors in the log-linear regression used for time-series studies of particulate air pollution and mortality and identify three main components of error. We present new simple analyses of data on exposures of particulate matter < 10 ""mu""m in aerodynamic diameter from the Particle Total Exposure Assessment Methodology Study. Finally, we summarize open questions regarding measurement error and suggest the kind of additional data necessary to address them."

Differences between the various modes are discussed. The fractions of fine and coarse particles collected in specific size ranges, such as total suspended particulate matter (TSP), PM10, PM2.5, and PM(10-2.5), are shown. Correlations of 24-h concentrations of PM2.5, PM10, and PM(10-2.5) at the same site show that, in Philadelphia and St. Louis, PM2.5 is highly correlated with PM10 but poorly correlated with PM (10-2.5). Among sites distributed across these urban areas, the site-to-site correlations of 24-h PM concentrations are high for PM2.5 but not for PM(10-2.5). This indicates that a PM measurement at a central monitor can serve as a better indicator of the community-wide concentration of fine particles than of coarse particles. The fraction of ambient outdoor particles found suspended indoors is greater for fine particles than for coarse particles because of the difference in indoor lifetimes. Consideration of these relationships leads to the hypothesis that the statistical associations found between daily PM indicators and health outcomes may be the result of variations in the fine particle component of the atmospheric aerosol, not of variations in the coarse component. As a result, epidemiologic studies using PM10 or TSP may provide more useful information on the acute health effects of fine particles than coarse particles. Fine and coarse particles are separate classes of pollutants and should be measured separately in research and epidemiologic studies. PM2.5 and PM(10-2.5) are indicators or surrogates, but not measurements, of fine and coarse particles."

However, daily metrics of the same pollutant have rarely been systematically compared within a study. In this analysis, we describe the variability of effect estimates attributable to the use of different temporal metrics of daily pollution levels. We obtained hourly measurements of ambient particulate matter (PM2.5), carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), and ozone (O3) from air monitoring networks in 20-county Atlanta for the time period 1993?2004. For each pollutant, we created (1) a daily 1-h maximum; (2) a 24-h average; (3) a commute average; (4) a daytime average; (5) a nighttime average; and (6) a daily 8-h maximum (only for O3). Using Poisson generalized linear models, we examined associations between daily counts of respiratory emergency department visits and the previous day's pollutant metrics. Variability was greatest across O3 metrics, with the 8-h maximum, 1-h maximum, and daytime metrics yielding strong positive associations and the nighttime O3 metric yielding a negative association (likely reflecting confounding by air pollutants oxidized by O3). With the exception of daytime metric, all of the CO and NO2 metrics were positively associated with respiratory emergency department visits. Differences in observed associations with respiratory emergency room visits among temporal metrics of the same pollutant were influenced by the diurnal patterns of the pollutant, spatial representativeness of the metrics, and correlation between each metric and copollutant concentrations. Overall, the use of metrics based on the US National Ambient Air Quality Standards (for example, the use of a daily 8-h maximum O3 as opposed to a 24-h average metric) was supported by this analysis. Comparative analysis of temporal metrics also provided insight into underlying relationships between specific air pollutants and respiratory health."

When modelled as Berkson-type error, risk ratios per unit of measurement were biased away from the null hypothesis by 2% to 31%, whereas risk ratios per IQR were attenuated (i.e. biased toward the null) by 5% to 34%. For CO modelled error amount, a range of error types were simulated and effects on risk ratio bias and significance were observed.<br /><br />Conculsions: For multiplicative error, both the amount and type of measurement error impact health effect estimates in air pollution epidemiology.

We used Poisson generalized linear models to estimate associations between current-day pollutant concentrations and circulatory emergency department visits for the 1998-2004 time period. Data from monitoring sites located in different geographical regions of the study area and at different distances from several urban geographical subpopulations served as alternative measures of exposure. We observed associations for spatially heterogeneous pollutants (CO and NO(2)) using data from several different urban monitoring sites. These associations were not observed when using data from the most rural site, located 38 miles from the city center. In contrast, associations for spatially homogeneous pollutants (O(3) and PM(2.5)) were similar, regardless of the monitoring site location. We found that monitoring site location and the distance of a monitoring site to a population of interest did not meaningfully affect estimated associations for any pollutant when using data from urban sites located within 20 miles from the population center under study. However, for CO and NO(2), these factors were important when using data from rural sites located > or = 30 miles from the population center, most likely owing to exposure measurement error.

The suitability of standard ozone exposure metric conversion ratios and implications for epidemiology,"Anderson, GB; Bell, ML",2010.0,"Several exposure metrics have been applied in health research and policy settings to represent ozone exposure, such as the 24 h average and daily 8 h maximum. Frequently, results calculated using one exposure metric are converted using a simple ratio to compare or combine findings with results using a different metric. This conversion, however, assumes that such a ratio is constant across locations and time periods. We investigated the appropriateness of this conversion method by examining the relationships among various forms of ozone concentrations (24 h average, daily 1 h maximum, and daily 8 h maximum) within and between communities for 78 US communities from 2000 to 2004 and compared results to commonly used conversion ratios. We explored whether the relationships between ozone exposure metrics differ by region, weather, season, and city-specific characteristics. Analysis revealed variation in the relationship among ozone metrics, both across communities and across time within individual communities, indicating that conversion of ozone exposure metrics with a standard ratio introduces uncertainty. For example, the average ratio of the daily 8 h maximum to the daily concentration ranged from 1.23 to 1.83. Within a community, days with higher ozone levels had lower ratios. Relationships among metrics within a community were associated with daily temperature. The community-average exposure metric ratios were lower for communities with higher long-term ozone levels. Ozone metric ratios differed by season because of the different rate of change of ozone metrics throughout the year. We recommend that health effects studies present results from multiple ozone exposure metrics, if possible. When conversions are necessary, more accurate estimates can be obtained using summaries of data for a given location and time period if available, or by basing conversion ratios on data from a similar city and season, such as the results provided in this study."

Pollutant levels recorded at centrally located ambient air quality monitors in a community are commonly used as proxies for population exposures. However, if ample intraurban spatial variation in pollutants exists, city-wide averages of concentrations may introduce exposure misclassification. We assessed spatial heterogeneity of particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter < or = 10 microm (PM10) and ozone (O3) and evaluated implications for epidemiological studies in S?o Paulo, Brazil, using daily (24-hr) and daytime (12-hr) averages and 1-hr daily maximums of pollutant levels recorded at the regulatory monitoring network. Monitor locations were also analyzed with respect to a socioeconomic status index developed by the municipal government. Hourly PM10 and O3 data for the S?o Paulo Municipality and Metropolitan Region (1999-2006) were used to evaluate heterogeneity by comparing distance between monitors with pollutants' correlations and coefficients of divergence (CODs). Both pollutants showed high correlations across monitoring sites (median = 0.8 for daily averages). CODs across sites averaged 0.20. Distance was a good predictor of CODs for PM10 (p < 0.01) but not O3, whereas distance was a good predictor of correlations for O3 (p < 0.01) but not PM10. High COD values and low temporal correlation indicate a spatially heterogeneous distribution of PM10. Ozone levels were highly correlated (r > or = 0.75), but high CODs suggest that averaging over O3 levels may obscure important spatial variations. Of municipal districts in the highest of five socioeconomic groups, 40% have > or = 1 monitor, whereas districts in the lowest two groups, representing half the population, have no monitors. Results suggest that there is a potential for exposure misclassification based on the available monitoring network and that spatial heterogeneity depends on pollutant metric (e.g., daily average vs. daily 1-hr maximum). A denser monitoring network or alternative exposure methods may be needed for epidemiological research. Findings demonstrate the importance of considering spatial heterogeneity and differential exposure misclassification by subpopulation."

Exposure to carbon monoxide, nitrogen dioxide, ozone, sulfur dioxide, and particulate matter was determined using data obtained from fixed-site air pollution monitors operated principally in urban areas. Four different methods of attributing pollution exposure were used based on residence in (1) 1980, (2) 1994, (3) 1980 and 1994, and (4) at all locations between 1980 and 2002. Between 1,693 and 4,274 of 10,515 members of the cohort could be assigned exposures to individual pollutants using these methods. On average, subjects spent 71.4% of the 1980-2002 period in the census subdivision where they lived in 1980. A single exposure measure in 1980 or 1994 or a mean of the two measures was highly correlated (r&gt;0.7, P&lt;0.0001) with a measure which accounted for all moves between 1980 and 2002. Although our ability to characterize long-term exposure was constrained by a lack of data from fixed-site monitors, the low frequency of moves meant that measures based on a single year generally provided a good approximation of long-term exposure at the census subdivision level."

We evaluated the effect of prenatal exposure to six common urban air pollutants in the Sydney metropolitan area on preterm birth.

METHODS: We obtained information on all births in metropolitan Sydney between January 1, 1998 and December 31, 2000. For each birth, exposure to each air pollutant was estimated for the first trimester, the three months preceding birth, the first month after the estimated date of conception and the month prior to delivery. Gestational age was analysed as a categorical variable in logistic regression models.

RESULTS: There were 123,840 singleton births in Sydney in 1998-2000 and 4.9% were preterm. Preterm birth was significantly associated with maternal age, maternal smoking, male infant, indigenous status and first pregnancy. Air pollutant levels in the month and three months preceding birth had no significant effect on preterm birth after adjusting for maternal and infant covariates. Ozone levels in the first trimester of pregnancy and spring months of conception and sulphur dioxide were associated with increased risks for preterm births. Nitrogen dioxide was associated with a decreased risk of preterm births.

CONCLUSION: We found more protective than harmful associations between ambient air pollutants and preterm births with most associations non-significant. In view of these inconsistent associations, it is important to interpret the harmful effects with caution. If our results are confirmed by future studies then it will be imperative to reduce Sydney's already low air pollution levels even further."

This work suggests that for estimating acute effects, ambient concentration measurements are quite adequate in time-series studies. In addition, time-series studies have ample power relative to panel studies, in spite of the ecologic nature of their design. Panel studies have the benefit of being able to use all the information from personal exposures in the analysis, but they are much more costly and difficult to conduct.

Although numerous time-series studies have estimated associations between day-to-day variation in ozone levels and mortality counts, results have been inconclusive.

Objective: To investigate whether short-term (daily and weekly) exposure to ambient ozone is associated with mortality in the United States.

Design and Setting: Using analytical methods and databases developed for the National Morbidity, Mortality, and Air Pollution Study, we estimated a national average relative rate of mortality associated with short-term exposure to ambient ozone for 95 large US urban communities from 1987-2000. We used distributed-lag models for estimating community-specific relative rates of mortality adjusted for time-varying confounders (particulate matter, weather, seasonality, and long-term trends) and hierarchical models for combining relative rates across communities to estimate a national average relative rate, taking into account spatial heterogeneity.

Main Outcome Measure: Daily counts of total non?injury-related mortality and cardiovascular and respiratory mortality in 95 large US communities during a 14-year period.

Results: A 10-ppb increase in the previous week?s ozone was associated with a 0.52% increase in daily mortality (95% posterior interval [PI], 0.27%-0.77%) and a 0.64% increase in cardiovascular and respiratory mortality (95% PI, 0.31%-0.98%). Effect estimates for aggregate ozone during the previous week were larger than for models considering only a single day?s exposure. Results were robust to adjustment for particulate matter, weather, seasonality, and long-term trends.

Conclusions: These results indicate a statistically significant association between short-term changes in ozone and mortality on average for 95 large US urban communities, which include about 40% of the total US population. The findings indicate that this widespread pollutant adversely affects public health."

This study was one of a group of personal exposure panel studies funded by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's National Exposure Research Laboratory to address areas of exposure assessment warranting further study, particularly associations between personal exposures and ambient concentrations of particulate matter and gaseous co-pollutants. Twenty-four-hour integrated personal, home indoor, home outdoor and ambient sulfate, elemental carbon (EC), PM2.5, ozone (O3), nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and sulfur dioxide were measured simultaneously each day. Fifteen homes in the Boston area were measured for 7 days during winter and summer. A previous paper explored the associations between personal?indoor, personal?outdoor, personal?ambient, indoor?outdoor, indoor?ambient and outdoor?ambient PM2.5, sulfate and EC concentrations. For the current paper, factors that may affect personal exposures were investigated, while controlling for ambient concentrations. The data were analyzed using mixed effects regression models. Overall personal?ambient associations were strong for sulfate during winter (p < 0.0001) and summer (p < 0.0001) and PM2.5 during summer (p < 0.0001). The personal?ambient mixed model slope for PM2.5 during winter but was not significant at p = 0.10. Personal exposures to most pollutants, with the exception of NO2, increased with ventilation and time spent outdoors. An opposite pattern was found for NO2 likely due to gas stoves. Personal exposures to PM2.5 and to traffic-related pollutants, EC and NO2, were higher for those individuals living close to a major road. Both personal and indoor sulfate and PM2.5 concentrations were higher for homes using humidifiers. The impact of outdoor sources on personal and indoor concentrations increased with ventilation, whereas an opposite effect was observed for the impact of indoor sources."

The indirect approach uses measurements of exposures in specific microenvironments (e.g., homes, bars, offices), validated microenvironmental models (based on the mass balance equation), and human activity pattern data obtained from questionnaires to predict frequency distributions of exposure for entire populations. This approach requires fewer resources than the direct approach to exposure assessment, for which the distribution of monitors to a representative sample of a given population is necessary. In the indirect exposure assessment approach, average microenvironmental concentrations are multiplied by the total time spent in each microenvironment to give total integrated exposure. By assuming that the concentrations encountered in each of 10 location categories are the same for different members of the U.S. population (i.e., the NHAPS respondents), the hypothetical contribution that ETS makes to the average 24-hr respirable suspended particle exposure for Americans working their main job is calculated in this paper to be 18 microg/m3.

This revision was motivated by the availability of increased knowledge of the anatomy and physiology of the respiratory tract and of the deposition, clearance, and biological effects of inhaled radioactive particles, and by greatly expanded dosimetry requirements. To meet fully the needs of radiation protection, a dosimetric model for the respiratory tract should:
- provide calculations of doses for individual members of the populations of all ethnic groups, in addition to workers;
- be useful for predictive and assessment purposes as well as for deriving limits on intakes;
- account for the influence of smoking, air pollutants, and respiratory tract diseases;
- provide for estimates of respiratory tract tissue doses from bioassay data; and
- be equally applicable to radioactive gases as well as to particles.
Addressing all of these requirements has resulted in a dosimetry model that is more complex than previous models."

At all experimental conditions, <5% of inspired Cl(2) penetrated beyond the upper airways and none reached the respiratory air spaces. On the other hand, larger penetrations of O(3) beyond the upper airways occurred as flow increased and during nasal than during oral breathing. In the extreme case of oral breathing at 1,000 ml/s, 35% of inhaled O(3) penetrated beyond the upper airways and approximately 10% reached the respiratory air spaces. Mass transfer theory indicated that the diffusion resistance of the tissue phase was negligible for Cl(2) but important for O(3).

Prior to and immediately following exposure spirometric and plethysmographic measurements of lung function were made. In addition, 5 min after the beginning of exposure and 5 min before the end of exposure the uptake efficiency of ozone in the upper and lower respiratory tract, spontaneous tidal volume (Vt), and breathing frequency (f) were measured. During exposure subjects wore a noseclip in order to constrain breathing to the oral pathway. Uptake efficiencies in the upper (FURT) and lower (FLRT) respiratory tracts were determined by continuously drawing air from the posterior pharynx into a rapidly responding chemiluminescent ozone analyzer. Linear regression models were constructed to examine the relationships between pulmonary function and breathing pattern responses, and the instantaneous and average values of FLRT and VE. Initial VE and average VE (VE) were found to be significant predictors of FEV1 decrement (p = 0.011 and p = 0.006, respectively). In addition the cross-product term FLRT x VE was a significant predictor of Vt decrement (p = 0.02). These results suggest that delivered dose, as determined primarily by VE, is responsible for some of the intersubject variability of ozone response. The failure of FLRT to play a significant role may be due to the fact that it primarily reflects ozone uptake in the lung periphery distal to anatomical sites where the ozone response may be mediated."

In each session, fractional absorption (FA) was determined on a breath-by-breath basis as the ratio of O(3) uptake to the inhaled O(3) dose.

Although C, MV, and T all had statistically significant effects on FA (P < 0.0001, P = 0.004, and P = 0.026, respectively), the magnitudes of these effects were small compared with intersubject variability. For an average subject, a 0. 05 change in FA would require that C change by 1.3 ppm, MV change by 46 l/min, or T change by 1.7 h.

The fraction of O3 absorbed during a single breath was measured over a range of airway penetrations from 20 to 200 ml, with inspiratory and expiratory flows fixed at a nominal value of 250 ml/s. The resulting data indicated that 50% of the inhaled O3 was absorbed at a penetration of 70 ml, which roughly corresponds to the upper airways, and essentially complete absorption occurred at a penetration of 180 ml, which roughly corresponds to the 16th airway generation, the beginning of the proximal alveolar region. This compares favorably with the results of direct-sampling methods, which indicated that 40.4% of continuously inhaled O3 is removed by the extrathoracic airways (Gerrity et al. J. Appl. Physiol. 65: 393-400, 1988).

During nasal breathing at a constant respiratory flow of 250 ml/s, lambda increased smoothly as Vp increased with 80% of the inhaled O3 absorbed in the upper airways and 90% absorbed at the distal end of the trachea. Oral breathing caused a distal shift of the lambda-Vp distribution to the extent that absorption in the upper airways was reduced to 50% and inhaled O3 was 90% absorbed only after a bolus reached the 13th bronchial generation. Therefore, an exercise-induced change from nasal to oral breathing can render the distal lung more susceptible to O3 damage because of an elevation in O3 dose. We also found that changing the peak inhaled bolus concentration over a 10-fold range of 0.4-4 ppm O3 did not affect the lambda-Vp distribution.

The objective of the present study was to determine the effect of alternative respiratory flows between 150 and 1,000 ml/s. Uptake was expressed as the O-3 absorbed during a single breath relative to the amount of O-3 in the inhaled bolus (Lambda). Measurements of Lambda were correlated with the penetration volume of the bolus into the respiratory tract (Vp). Vp in the range of 20-70 ml was considered to indicate upper airways (UA), the Vp interval of 70-180 ml was identified as lower conducting airways (CA), and Vp > 180 ml was associated with the respiratory air spaces (RA). During quiet oral breathing at 250 ml/s, Lambda increased smoothly as Vp increased, with 50% of the inhaled O-3 absorbed in the UAs and the remainder absorbed within the CAs such that no O-3 reached the RAs. The effect of increasing the respiratory flow was to shift the Lambda-Vp distribution distally such that significantly less O-3 was absorbed in the UAs and CAs and some O-3 reached the RAs. For example, at 1,000 ml/s, only 10% of the inhaled O-3 was absorbed in UAs and 65% was absorbed in the CAs such that 25% reached the RAs. Further analysis of these data with a mathematical diffusion model suggested that the reaction between O-3 and biochemical substrates is so fast (i.e., estimated 1st-order rate constant was on the order of 10(6) s(-1)) that O-3 is decomposed close to the gas-mucus interface in the CAs."

Because the National Ambient Air Quality Standard for ozone (O3) is intended to protect the most sensitive individuals in the general population, it is necessary to identify sources of intersubject variation in the exposure-dose-response cascade. We hypothesize that differences in lung anatomy can modulate exposure-dose relationships between individuals, and this results in differences between their responsiveness to O3 at a fixed exposure condition. During quiet breathing, the conducting airways remove the majority of inhaled O3, so the volume of this region should have an important impact on O3 dose distribution. Employing the bolus inhalation method, we measured the distribution of O3 absorption with respect to penetration volume (VP), and using the Fowler single-breath N2 washout method, we determined the dead space volume (VD) in the lungs of 10 men and 10 women at a fixed respiratory flow of 250 ml/s. On average, the women absorbed O3 at smaller VP than the men, and the women had smaller VD than the men. When expressed in terms of VP/ VD, the absorption distribution of the men and women was indistinguishable. Moreover, an interpretation of the O3 distribution in terms of an intrinsic mass transfer parameter (Ka) indicated that differences between the O3 dosimetry in all subjects, whether men or women, could be explained by a unique correlation with anatomic dead space: Ka (in s-1) = 610 VD-1.05 (in ml). Application of this result to measurements of O3 exposure response indicated that previously reported gender differences may be due to a failure in properly accounting for tissue surface within the conducting airways."

The second hypothesis was that differences in breathing pattern and lung anatomy induce differences in ozone uptake. Sixty healthy nonsmokers participated in three exposure protocols during which their minute ventilation was 30 L/min, corresponding to moderate exercise. For the intermittent bolus exposure to ozone (BO3*), we measured the penetration volume at which 50% of the bolus was taken up (VP50%). Before and after continuous clean air exposure (Ca) and continuous ozone exposure (CO3: 0.25 ppm ozone), we measured forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1), calculated as the percent change after exposure relative to start of exposure [%FEV1]). We also measured the cross-sectional area of the peripheral lung (Ap) for carbon dioxide (CO2) diffusion, calculated as the percent change after exposure relative to start of exposure (%Ap). After the CO3 session, we also measured ozone uptake (as ozone uptake rate) and fractional ozone uptake efficiency. Uptake efficiency ranged from 0.70 to 0.98 among all subjects. It was inversely correlated with breathing frequency (P = 0.000) but was not correlated with conducting airways volume (P = 0.333). VP50% ranged from 67 to 135 mL among all subjects and was directly correlated with conducting airways volume (P = 0.000). These results indicate that overall ozone uptake was related to breathing frequency but not to airway size, whereas internal distribution of ozone shifted distally as airway size increased. Values of %FEV1 (mean +/- SD: -13.71 +/- 12.99) and %Ap (-7.80 +/- 9.34) were both significantly more negative (P = 0.000) in the CO3 session than in the Ca (control) session (-0.055 +/- 4.57 and 0.40 +/- 11.03, respectively). Ozone uptake rate correlated with individual %Ap (P = 0.008) but not with individual %FEV1 (P = 0.575). Nor were individual %Ap or %FEV1 correlated with VP50%. Therefore, ozone uptake did not explain intersubject differences in forced expiratory responses in this study, but it did partially explain differences in the cross-sectional area available for gas diffusion in the peripheral lung."

Secondary motions were observed at all flow rates, their form depending upon direction of flow. Depending upon the curvature of the junction, flow separation with sluggish reversed flow could be observed in daughter tubes during inspiration. Inspiratory flow velocity profiles are highly asymmetric. In the plane of the junction, peak velocities swing to the inner walls. During expiration velocity profiles normal to the junction plane become flat while profiles in the plane develop an axial peak.

To test whether this variability is related to the local dose of ozone at the tissue site or to local concentrations of glutathione, we exposed adult male rhesus monkeys for 2 h to filtered air or to 0.4 or 1.0 ppm ozone generated from 18O2. Following exposure, lungs were split into lobes and specimens were selected by microdissection so that measurements could be made on airway tissue of similar branching history, including trachea, proximal (generation one or two) and distal (generation six or seven) intrapulmonary bronchi, and proximal respiratory bronchioles. One half of the lung was lavaged for analysis of extracellular components. In monkeys exposed to filtered air, the concentration of reduced glutathione (GSH) varied throughout the airway tree, with the proximal intrapulmonary bronchus having the lowest concentration and the parenchyma having the highest concentration. Exposure to 1.0 ppm ozone significantly reduced GSH only in the respiratory bronchiole, whereas exposure to 0.4 ppm increased GSH only in the proximal intrapulmonary bronchus. Local ozone dose (measured as excess 18O) varied by as much as a factor of three in different airways of monkeys exposed to 1.0 ppm, with respiratory bronchioles having the highest concentration and the parenchyma the lowest concentration. In monkeys exposed to 0.4 ppm, the ozone dose was 60% to 70% less than in the same site in monkeys exposed to 1.0 ppm. Epithelial disruption was present to some degree in all airway sites, but not in the parenchyma, in animals exposed to 1.0 ppm ozone. The mass of mucous and ciliated cells decreased in all airways, and necrotic and inflammatory cells increased. At 0.4 ppm, epithelial injury was minimal, except in the respiratory bronchiole, where cell loss and necrosis occurred, and was 50% that found in monkeys exposed to 1.0 ppm ozone. We conclude that there is a close association between site-specific O3 dose, the degree of epithelial injury, and glutathione depletion at local sites in the tracheobronchial tree."

Simulation results illustrate the variability of results due to an uncertainty in the knowledge of transport parameters, liquid, tissue, and blood compartment thicknesses, and chemical reaction rates. Results were most sensitive to mucous compartment thickness and reaction rate constant and least sensitive to transport and blood parameters.

To correct this omission, we have used several sources of data on age-dependent lower respiratory tract (LRT) volumes, age-dependent airway dimensions, a model of the adult tracheobronchial region, and a model of the adult acinus to construct theoretical LRT lung models for humans from birth to adulthood. An ozone (O3) dosimetry model was then used to estimate the regional and local uptake of O3 in the (theoretical) LRT of children and adults. For sedentary or quiet breathing, the LRT distribution of absorbed O3, the percent uptake (84 to 88%) and the centriacinar O3 tissue dose are not very sensitive to age. For maximal work during exercise, predicted LRT uptakes range from 87 to 93%, and the regional percent uptakes are more dependent on age than during quiet breathing. In general, the total quantity of O3 absorbed per minute increases with age. Regardless of age and state of breathing, the largest tissue dose of O3 is predicted to occur in the centriacinar region, where many animal studies show the maximal morphological damage from O3."

Quantitative serial section analyses of vascular perfusion-fixed rat lungs were used to determine the anatomic dead space proximal to specific ventilatory units as well as the gas volume of these ventilatory untis. Three reconstructions, each consisting of ventilatory units distal to a specific bronchus, were carried out. The number of ventilatory untis for each reconstruction varied from 26 to 71. The average ventilatory unit volume for the three reconstructions [0.53 .+-. .03 (SE) mm3] was not significantly different from measurments based on random sampling. The distribution of ventilatory unit volume was diverse, with 15% of the population having a volume > 0.3 mm3 and 9% of the population having avolume > 1.0 mm3. For a gas of relatively low reactivity (e.g., oxygen) the predicted oxygen uptake per unit surface area did not vary significantly between ventilatory units. The predicted oxygen uptake was .apprx.92% of the uptake in the absence of gradients in oxygen concentration between ventilatory units. For a highly reactive gas (e.g., ozone), the predicted uptake per unit surface area in the proximal portions of larger ventilatory units was significantly greater than the average uptake. These results suggest that focal areas of injury likely result from exposure to inhaled reactive gases."

Ozone (0.2 parts/million) was pulled through both nostrils and out of the mouth at a constant flow while the subjects closed their epiglottises.

Average preexercise uptake of ozone was 56 +/- 7.8 and 37 +/- 4.9% at 10 and 20 l/min, respectively. These averages did not significantly differ from those immediately postexercise (55 and 37%). Nasal ozone uptake increased significantly (P < 0.001) with decreasing flow rate, but intersubject variability in uptake could not be predicted by nasal volume or cross-sectional areas (as measured by acoustic rhinometry) or endogenous nitric oxide production. However, the percent change in ozone uptake after exercise, within an individual, was correlated with both 1) percent change in nasal volume (r = 0.70 at 10 l/min) and 2) percent change in the rate of volumetric expansion between the nasal valve and turbinates (r = 0.82 at 10 l/min).

(18)O content in each airway sample was quantified and normalized to surface area. Across frequencies, there was significantly greater (p < .05) 18O content in the trachea and bronchi (conducting airway epithelium) compared to the parenchyma sampling sites. Tracheal (18)O content decreased between 80 and 160 bpm, but then underwent an increase at 200 bpm.

Right cranial parenchymal (18)O content decreased at 200 bpm compared to 80, 120, and 160 bpm. Right caudal parenchymal (18)O content was relatively constant over all breathing frequencies.

Due to the physicochemical similarities between O3 and NO2, we utilized investigational strategies analogous to those previously employed to characterize NO2 absorption kinetics. The effects of vascular perfusion, temperature, inspired concentration ([O3]i), surface area, and minute ventilation (tidal volume (Vt) times ventilation frequency (f)) on air space O3 clearance during quasi-steady-state exposures were investigated using fractional uptakes (%U) and reactive uptake coefficients (k') as endpoints. We found the following: (1) At 1 ppm [O3]i (37 degrees C), %U (95 +/- 5%) was perfusion independent (60 min). (2) %U displayed temperature dependence (r = 0.99). Activation energies (Ea) and Q10 were computed from Arrhenius plots (ln k' vs 1/T; r = -0.99). For 1 ppm (11-37 degrees C), Ea = 4140 kcal/g.mol and Q10 = 1.23. (3) Absorption demonstrated [O3]i dependence. At 25 degrees C, &lt; or = 1 ppm displayed %U = 86 +/- 4% with k' = 234 ml/min. Exposures &gt; 1 ppm resulted in decreasing %U and k' (5 ppm %U = 60 +/- 3% and k' = 121 ml/min). (4) To evaluate epithelial damage, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activity was quantified in cell-free bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. For exposures &lt; or = 1 ppm LDH equaled control, while for exposures &gt; 1 ppm LDH steadily increased to a four-fold maximum at 5 ppm. (5) O3 uptake was independent of functional residual capacity-induced changes in air space surface area. (6) Absorption was proportional to Vt (r = 0.99) and displayed notable ventilation frequency-dependent decline above 70 breaths per minute. Based on the perfusion independence, temperature dependence, and the Ea and Q10, we conclude that O3 absorption in isolated lungs involves a reactive component. While k' remained stable from 0 to 1 ppm O3, at concentrations above 1 ppm other contributory factors such as O3/substrate reaction kinetics, epithelial damage, and solute O3 backpressure may affect the overall net absorption rate. In addition, the data suggest that O3 uptake may be principally localized to the conducting airways."

This study examined the distribution of O3 uptake in a single, symmetrically branched airway bifurcation. Reaction in the epithelial lining fluid was assumed to be so rapid that O3 concentration was negligible along the entire surface of the bifurcation wall. Three-dimensional numerical solutions of the continuity, Navier?Stokes and convection?diffusion equations were obtained for steady inspiratory and expiratory flows at Reynolds numbers ranging from 100 to 500. The total rate of O3 uptake was found to increase with increasing flow rate during both inspiration and expiration. Hot spots of O3 flux appeared at the carina of the bifurcation for virtually all inspiratory and expiratory Reynolds numbers considered in the simulations. At the lowest expiratory Reynolds number, however, the location of the maximum flux was shifted to the outer wall of the daughter branch. For expiratory flow, additional hot spots of flux were found on the parent branch wall just downstream of the branching region.

This study provides insight into the effect of flow conditions on O3 uptake and dose distribution in individual bifurcations."

In the single-path model of the respiratory system, gas transport occurs within a conduit of progressively increasing cross-sectional and surface areas by a combination of flow, longitudinal dispersion, and lateral absorption. The purpose of this study was to use bolus inhalation data previously obtained for chlorine (Cl2) and for ozone (O3) to test the predictive capability of the single-path model and to adjust input parameters for applying the model to other exposure conditions. The data, consisting of uptake fraction as a function of bolus penetration volume, were recorded on 10 healthy nonsmokers breathing orally as well as nasally at alternative air flows of 150, 250, and 1000 ml/s. By employing published data for airway anatomy, gas-phase dispersion coefficients, and gas-phase mass transfer coefficients while neglecting diffusion limitations in the mucus phase, the single-path model was capable of predicting the uptake distribution for O3 but not the steeper distribution that was observed for Cl2. To simultaneously explain the data for these two gases, it was necessary to increase gas-phase mass transfer coefficients and to include a finite diffusion resistance of O3 within the mucous layer. The O3 reaction rate constants that accounted for this diffusion resistance, 2 I 106 s-1 in the mouth and 8 I 106 s-1 in the nose and lower airways, were much greater than previously reported reactivities of individual substrates found in mucus."

The exposure protocols included continuous monitoring of respiratory flow rate and O3 concentration from which O3 uptake (OZU) and fractional uptake efficiency (UE) were computed. Pre-to-post changes in forced expired volume in 1 s (%?FEV1), peripheral cross section for carbon dioxide diffusion (%? AP), and Fowler dead space volume (VD) were also measured for each exposure. Individual values of UE ranged from.70 to.98 among all the subjects, with significant differences (p < .05) existing between men and women. These intersubject differences were inversely correlated with breathing frequency and directly correlated with tidal volume. The mean ? SD values of %? FEV1, %? AP, and %?

The specific goal of this study was to demonstrate an approach for using physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) modeling to compare inhalation dosimetry in the adult and the child of both males and females. Three categories of gases were considered: rapidly and irreversibly reactive in the respiratory tract (ozone), relatively water-soluble and nonreactive (isopropanol), and relatively water-insoluble and nonreactive (styrene, vinyl chloride, and perchloroethylene). The nonreactive chemicals were also selected because they are metabolized in the respiratory tract. The age-related changes observed for the estimated dose metrics were a function of the physiochemical properties of the inhaled vapor and their interactions in the body. Blood concentrations estimated for all vapors, either poorly metabolized (e.g., PERC), moderately metabolized (e.g., ST), or highly metabolized vapors (e.g., IPA and VC), varied less than a factor of two between infants and adults. These changes, moreover, were confined to the first year after birth, a relatively short window compared to the total lifespan of the individual. In contrast, circulating metabolite concentrations estimated in the blood, as well as amounts metabolized in the liver and lung, appeared to be a strong function of age, due to their dependence on the maturity of the pertinent metabolic enzyme systems."

Indeed, in most instances, the metabolic cost of ventilation represents the only significant contribution of the pulmonary system to the limitation of O2 transport of locomotor muscles and thus to the limitation of maximum performance. Of the ""weaknesses"" inherent in the healthy pulmonary system response to exercise, the most serious one may well be its absence of structural adaptability to physical training or to the trained state. Thus, the lung's diffusion capacity and pulmonary capillary blood volume remain unaltered in the highly trained human or horse, while maximum pulmonary blood flow rises linearly with the enhanced max VO2. Similarly, ventilatory requirement rises markedly, with no alteration in the capability of the airways to produce higher flow rates or of the lung parenchyma to stretch to higher tidal volumes, and little or no change in the pressure-generating capability of inspiratory muscles. The case of the elderly athlete who remains capable of achieving high maximum pulmonary blood flows and ventilatory requirements and whose lung undergoes a normal aging process underscores the importance of deficits (from ""normal"") on the capacity end of this continuum of cost versus capacity in the pulmonary system. The asthmatic athlete may represent another such example of limited flow-generating capacity; and the healthy, young, highly fit athlete who shows marked reductions in SaO2 and in max VO2 at even moderately high altitudes demonstrates that, in many situations, precious little room can be added to the demand side or removed from the capacity side before signs of failure can be seen."

First, flow limitation in intrathoracic airways may occur during exercise because of narrowed, hyperactive airways or secondary to excessive ventilatory demands superimposed on a normal maximum flow-volume envelope. Narrowing of the extrathoracic, upper airway also occurs in some athletes at very high flow rates during heavy exercise. Examination of the breath-by-breath tidal flow-volume loop during exercise is key to a noninvasive diagnosis of flow limitation and to differentiation between intrathoracic and extrathoracic airway narrowing. Second exercise-induced arterial hypoxemia occurs secondary to an excessively widened alveolar-arterial oxygen pressure difference. This inefficient gas exchange may be attributable in part to small intracardiac or intrapulmonary shunts of deoxygenated mixed venous blood during exercise. The existence of these shunts at rest and during exercise may be determined by using saline solution contrast echocardiography. Finally, fatigue of the respiratory muscles resulting from sustained, high-intensity exercise and the resultant vasoconstrictor effects on limb muscle vasculature will also compromise O(2) transport and performance. Exercise in the hypoxic environments of even moderately high altitudes will greatly exacerbate the negative influences of these respiratory system limitations to exercise performance, especially in highly fit individuals."

Lipid-protein surfactant complexes are assembled in alveolar pneumocytes in the form of tightly packed membranes, which are stored in specialized organelles called lamellar bodies (LB). Upon secretion of LBs, surfactant develops a membrane-based network that covers rapidly and efficiently the whole respiratory surface. This membrane-based surface layer is organized in a way that permits efficient gas exchange while optimizing the encounter of many different molecules and cells at the epithelial surface, in a cross-talk essential to keep the whole organism safe from potential pathogenic invaders. The present review summarizes what is known about the structure of the different forms of surfactant, with special emphasis on current models of the molecular organization of surfactant membrane components. The architecture and the behaviour shown by surfactant structures in vivo are interpreted, to some extent, from the interactions and the properties exhibited by different surfactant models as they have been studied in vitro, particularly addressing the possible role played by surfactant proteins. However, the limitations in structural complexity and biophysical performance of surfactant preparations reconstituted in vitro will be highlighted in particular, to allow for a proper evaluation of the significance of the experimental model systems used so far to study structure-function relationships in surfactant, and to define future challenges in the design and production of more efficient clinical surfactants."

Oxidative damage to proteins causes significant decreases in the content of thiol groups, the fluorescence of protein-tryptophan residues, and the activity of membrane-bound acetylcholinesterase. Oxidative damage to lipids causes changes in some of the unsaturated fatty acids (UFA) in the lipid fraction of these RBC membranes. Significant amounts of hexanal, heptanal, and nonanal are formed from the ozonation of UFA. Although no decrease in the amount of oleate is detected, it does undergo ozonation to yield nonanal; thus, as would be expected, product appearance is a more sensitive measure of ozonation than is substrate disappearance. These results imply that both proteins and unsaturated lipids undergo simultaneous and competitive ozonation in human RBC membranes when ozone is the limiting reactant. The ratios of reaction of ozone with different targets can be predicted in reasonably good agreement with the observed values using calculations (W. A. Pryer and R. M. Uppu (1993) J. Biol.

Only very low yields (less than 5%) or reducible materials other than hydrogen peroxide are observed, suggesting that the yields of organic peroxidic materials, including Criegee ozonides and lipid hydroperoxides, are small. Ozonolysis of rat erythrocyte ghost membranes and rat bronchoalveolar lavage also give significant yields (about 50%) of hydrogen peroxide based on the moles of ozone consumed. Reactions of ozone with bovine serum albumin, glutathione, and glucose do not produce hydrogen peroxide, implying that the hydrogen peroxide formed during the ozonation of biological materials arises almost exclusively from ozone/olefin reactions.

Exposures of isolated rat lungs, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) and egg phosphatidyl choline(PC) liposomes were conducted. 1) O3 absorption by AH2, uric acid, and albumin exceeded that by egg PC and glutathione. O3 reaction with egg PC occurred when AFT2 concentrations were reduced. 2) Aldehydes were produced in low yield during lung and BALF exposures in a time- and O3 concentration-dependent manner. 3) Diminishing BALF AH2 content lowered O3 uptake but increased aldehyde yields. Conversely, AH2 addition to egg PC increased O3 uptake but reduced aldehyde yields. Estimations of bioactive ozonation and autoxidation product accumulation within the ELF suggested possible nanomolar to low micromolar concentrations. The use of reaction products as metrics of O3 exposure may have intrinsic sensitivity and specificity limitations. Moreover, due to the heterogenous nature of O3 reactions within the ELF, dose-response relationships may not be linear with respect to O3 absorption."

These three aldehydes primarily result from the Criegee ozonation of specific mono- or polyunsaturated fatty acids that are present in significant amounts in the rat lung; e.g., palmitoleic acid gives heptanal, oleic gives nonanal, and linoleic and arachidonic can give hexanal. Hexanal also is produced in the ozone-initiated autoxidation of any n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acid, and thus is a measure of generalized oxidative stress. (Monounsaturated fatty acids do not undergo appreciable autoxidation.) This detection and quantitation of aldehydes directly demonstrates for the first time that unsaturated fatty acids undergo Criegee ozonation in the lung when ozone is inhaled. Exposure to ozone alone produced smaller apparent yields of the three aldehydes than did exposure to ozone plus 5% CO2. Hexanal, heptanal, and nonanal can be detected in BAL of rats 5 hr after the end of the ozone exposure, but after more than 5 hr only hexanal can be found, probably from ozone-induced autoxidation of n-6 PUFA that continues after ozone exposure. The measured amounts  of  aldehydes  are  low,  and that, coupled with inherent biovariability, suggests that aldehydes may not be useful as quantitative dosimeters. However, they can be useful biomarkers, since some of these aldehydes (e.g., nonanal) are produced in ozone-specific pathways and aldehydes are the most easily detected among the lipid ozonation products (LOP). Furthermore, our identification of these aldehydes by BAL, coupled with our recognition that ozone itself cannot penetrate far enough into the lung to cause many of the effects associated with the inhalation of ozone, suggests that these aldehydes, as well as other types of LOP (such as hydroxyhydroperoxides and Criegee ozonides), may act as signal transduction molecules, activating lipases and causing the release of inflammatory molecules by a variety of pathways not yet entirely elucidated."

Despite much research, the mechanisms of ozone- and oxidant-induced cellular injury are still uncertain. Ozone and secondary free radicals have been reported to cause the formation of aldehydes in biological fluids. One of the most toxic aldehydes formed during oxidant-induced lipid peroxidation is 4-hydroxynonenal (HNE). HNE reacts primarily with Cys, Lys, and His amino acids, altering protein function and forming protein adducts. The purpose of this study was to determine whether HNE could account for the acute effects of ozone on lung cells. Human subjects were exposed to 0.4 parts/million ozone or air for 1 h with exercise (each subject served as his/her own control). Six hours after ozone exposure, cells obtained by airway lavage were examined for apoptotic cell injury, and cells from bronchoalveolar lavage were examined for apoptosis, presence of HNE adducts, and expression of stress proteins. Significant apoptosis was evident in airway lung cells after ozone exposure. Western analysis demonstrated an increase in a 32-kDa HNE protein adduct and a number of stress proteins, viz., 72-kDa heat shock protein and ferritin, in alveolar macrophages (AM) after ozone exposure. All of these effects could be replicated by in vitro exposure of AM to HNE. Consequently, the in vitro results and demonstration of HNE protein adducts after ozone exposure are consistent with a potential role for HNE in the cellular toxic effects of ozone."

Ozone is not itself a radical, and we have asked: With what molecules does ozone react in the lung and how are radicals produced? Ozone reacts by two quite different mechanisms to produce radicals; one involves an ozone-olefin reaction and the other a reaction with electron donors such as glutathione (GSH). The first mechanism splits an R radical out of an olefin with the structure R-CH = CH2. The R then reacts with dioxygen to become a peroxyl radical (ROO), and both carbon- and oxygen-centered radicals can be detected by the electron spin resonance spin trap method. From the effects of temperature, metal chelators, and water, it is concluded that ozone reacts by the Criegee ozonation pathway to give the classical 1,2,3-trioxolane, which then undergoes O--O bond homolysis to form a diradical. This diradical then either undergoes beta-scission to split out the R radical or forms the more usual carbonyl oxide and a carbonyl compound. (See Figure 3 in the text). The low yield of Criegee ozonide that is generally obtained probably is due in part to the reactions forming radicals from the 1,2,3-trioxolane that compete with production of the Criegee ozonide. The second mechanism for radical production involves the reaction of ozone with electron donors. If the electron donor is, for example, GSH or its ion (GS-), this reaction produces the thiyl radical GS. and 0.3-. The ozone radical anion then reacts with a proton to form the hydroxyl radical and dioxygen: O3.- + H+--&gt;HO. and O2. Using 5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline-N-oxide, the spin adduct of the hydroxyl radical is detected. Similar reactions are observed with catechol."

Whereas free radicalderived oxidized cholesterol products have been frequently studied for their cytotoxic effects, ozonized cholesterol products have not been studied, although they could reasonably play a role in the toxicity of ozone. The reaction of ozone with cholesterol yielded a complex series of products including 3beta-hydroxy-5-oxo-5,6-secocholestan-6-al, 5-hydroperoxy-B-homo-6-oxa-cholestan-3beta,7a-diol, and 5beta,6beta-epoxycholesterol.

A dose-dependent formation of 5beta,6beta-epoxycholesterol was also seen during direct exposure of intact cultured human bronchial epithelial cells (16-HBE) to ozone. Studies of the metabolism of this epoxide in lung epithelial cells yielded small amounts of the expected metabolite, cholestan-3beta,5alpha,6beta-triol, and more abundant levels of an unexpected metabolite, cholestan-6-oxo-3beta,5alpha-diol. Both 5beta,6beta-epoxycholesterol and cholestan-6-oxo-3beta,5alpha-diol were shown to be cytotoxic to cultured 16-HBE cells.

We observed the following: (1) UA constituted the most o3-reactive substrate in each of the models examined. Reactivity hierarchies  in each were as follows: UA > AA >> GSH (individual antioxidant), UA > AA > GSH (composite antioxidant), and UA >> AA approximately equal to GSH (composite antioxidant + albumin). Consumption of  GSH as a pure antioxidant solution was associated with a 2:1 stoichiometric conversion of GSH to GSSG. This simplistic relationship was lost in the more complex models. (3) Consumption of antioxidants by O3 occurred without alteration of sample pH. (4) Protein carbonyl formation was observed when albumin alone was exposed to O3. However, in the presence of the composite antioxidant solution no evidence of this oxidative modification was apparent. These data indicate that GSH does not represent an important substrate for O3. In contrast, UA displays high reactivity consistent with its acting as a sacrificial substrate in the ELF. As UA concentrations are highest in the ELF of the proximal airways, its localization, allied to its reactivity, suggesting that it plays important roles, both in conferring protection locally and also by ""scrubbing"" O3, from inhaled air, limiting its penetration to the more sensitive distal lung."

Considerable intersubject variation was however observed. The individual rates of consumption for each antioxidant were significantly correlated with the respective initial antioxidant concentration. In contrast, although GSH was consumed at 50 ppb ozone, the rate of consumption did not change with increasing ozone concentration.

The prototype phenolate PhO-, in contrast, undergoes electron transfer under identical conditions. These reactions are deemed to occur at the gas/liquid interface because their rates: (1) depend on pH, (2) are several orders of magnitude faster than within microdroplets saturated with O3(g). They also fail to incorporate solvent into the products: the same (alpha)-TO-On- species are formed on acetonitrile or nucleophilic methanol microdroplets. (alpha)-TO-On=1-3- signals initially evolve with [O3(g)] as expected from first-generation species, but (alpha)-TO-O- reacts further with O3(g) and undergoes collisionally induced dissociation into a C19H40 fragment (vs C19H38 from (alpha)-TO-) carrying the phytyl side chain, whereas the higher (alpha)-TO-On(>/=)2- homologues are unreactive toward O3(g) and split CO2 instead. On this basis, (alpha)-TO-O- is assigned to a chroman-6-ol (4a, 8a)-ene oxide, (alpha)-TO-O2- to an endoperoxide, and (alpha)-TO-O3- to a secondary ozonide. The atmospheric degradation of the substituted phenols detected in combustion emissions is therefore expected to produce related oxidants on the aerosol particles present in the air we breathe."

Here, we report novel electrospray mass spectrometry experiments showing that sulfonates (GSO(3)(-)/GSO(3)(2-)), not GSSG, are the exclusive final products on the surface of aqueous GSH microdroplets exposed to dilute O(3)(g) for approximately 1 ms. The higher reactivity of the thiolate GS(2-) toward O(3)(g) over the thiol GS(-) is kinetically resolved in this time frame due to slow GS(-) acid dissociation. However, our experiments also show that O(3) will be largely scavenged by the more reactive ascorbate coantioxidant in typical interfacial biofilms. The presence of GSSG and the absence of GSO(3)(-)/GSO(3)(2-) in extracellular lining fluids are therefore evidence of GSH oxidation by species other than O(3)."

Here, the possibility that the synergistic adverse health effects of atmospheric O3(g) and acidic particulate matter revealed by epidemiological studies could be mediated by hitherto unidentified species is investigated by electrospray mass spectrometry of aqueous AH2 droplets exposed to O3(g). The products of AH2 ozonolysis at the relevant air?water interface shift from the innocuous dehydroascorbic acid at biological pH to a C4-hydroxy acid plus a previously unreported ascorbate ozonide (m/z = 223) below pH ?5. The structure of this ozonide is confirmed by tandem mass spectrometry and its mechanism of formation delineated by kinetic studies.

UA reactivity increases 380 times from pH 4 to 7, which is at variance with the pH-independent rates reported for the UA + O3(aq) reaction in bulk water. At pH 7, UA and ascorbic acid (AH2) microdroplets react with O3(g) at similar rates, although UA is 40 times more reactive than AH2 toward O3(aq) in bulk water. Only the UA epoxide, plus traces of UA peroxide, are formed upon mixing UA(aq) and O3(aq) solutions. We infer that the gas?liquid ozonolysis of UA proceeds in an interfacial aqueous medium quite distinct from bulk water.

Reactions near the ELF gas/liquid interface likely provide the driving force for O3 absorption (""reactive absorption"") and constrain O3 diffusion to the underlying epithelium. To investigate the potential mechanisms wherein O3/ELF interactions may induce cellular damage, we utilized a red cell membrane (RCM) model intermittently covered by an aqueous film to mimic the lung surface compartmentation, and evaluated exposure-mediated loss of acetylcholinesterase activity (AChE) and TBARS accumulation. In the absence of aqueous reactants, O3 exposure induced no detectable changes in AChE or TBARS. AH2 and GSH preferentially induced oxidative damage in a dose-dependent fashion. AH2-mediated RCM oxidation was not inhibited by superoxide dismutase, catalase, mannitol, or Fe chelators. O3 reaction with UA, Trolox, or albumin produced no RCM oxidation but oxidation occurred when AH2 was combined with UA or albumin. Rat bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) also induced RCM oxidation. However, in vivo O3 exposure dampened the extent of BALF-mediated RCM oxidation. Although we cannot completely rule out O3 diffusion to the RCM, product(s) derived from O3 + AH2/GSH reactions (possibly O3*- or 1O2) likely initiated RCM oxidation and may suggest that in vivo, such secondary species account for O3 permeation through the ELF leading to cellular perturbations."

The authors computed the change in absorption resulting from exposure (delta lambda) by comparing the amount of each ozone bolus that was absorbed with a corresponding value obtained prior to exposure. Results indicated that ozone exposure caused delta lambda to decrease relative to air exposure (p < .01), whereas both nitrogen dioxide and sulfur dioxide exposures caused an increase in delta lambda that was not significantly different from air exposure. This resulted, at least in part, to an artifact caused by preexposure to ozone boluses. The authors concluded that exposure of the lower conducting airways to nitrogen dioxide or sulfur dioxide increased their capacity to absorb ozone because more of the biochemical substrates that are normally oxidized by ozone were made available.

Exposure to ozone resulted in significant (P < 0.01) decrements in FEV1 with no protection observed following vitamin supplementation (-8.5%) versus placebo (-7.3%) treatment. Similarly, ozone-induced neutrophilia were of a similar magnitude after both treatments (P < 0.05). This lack of protection was observed despite elevated plasma vitamin C (+60.1%) and vitamin E (+51.4%) concentrations following supplementation, and increased vitamin C concentrations in the airways after supplementation following ozone exposure. These data do not therefore support the contention that acute ozone-induced symptoms can be attenuated through the use of dietary antioxidants in well-nourished individuals."

Dogs were either untreated or pre-treated with probenecid (an anion-transport inhibitor) and exposed for 6 h to 0.2parts/million O3. Peripheral airway resistance (Rpa) and reactivity (DRpa) were monitored in three sublobar locations before and after exposure to either air or O3. Pulmonary resistance and transepithelial potentialdifference in trachea and bronchus were also recorded. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) was collected before, during, and after exposure. O3 increased Rpa and DRpa only in probenecid-treated dogs and in a location-dependent fashion. Pulmonary resistance and potential difference in bronchus increased after O3 exposure regardless of treatment. O3 markedly increased BALF neutrophils only in untreated dogs. With the exception of hexanal, O3 did not alter any BALF constituent examined. Probenecid reduced BALF ascorbate, BALF protein, and plasma urate. We conclude that 1) a 6-h exposure to 0.2 parts/million O3 represents a subthreshold stimulus in relation to its effects on peripheral airway function in dogs, 2) antioxidant transport contributes to the maintenance of normal airway tone and reactivity under conditions of oxidant stress, 3) O3-induced changes in Rpa and DRpa are dependent on location, and 4) peripheral airway hyperreactivity and inflammation reflect independent responses to O3 exposure. Finally, although anion transport mitigates the effect of O3 on peripheral airway function, it contributes to the development of airway inflammation and may represent a possible target for anti-inflammatory prevention or therapy."

In this study, the effect of exposure to 0.4 ppm ozone on nasal inflammation in 11 allergic asthmatics sensitive to Dermatophygoides farinae was examined. This study was designed such that the effect of ozone exposure on the late-phase reaction to allergen was emphasized, using eosinophil influx and changes in eosinophil cationic protein as principal endpoints. By employing a ""split-nose"" design, in which allergen was applied to only one side of the nose while saline was applied to the contralateral side, both the effect of ozone on nasal inflammation due to allergen challenge as well as its direct action on non-allergen-challenged nasal tissues was examined. The results reported herein indicate that ozone exposure has both a priming effect on allergen-induced responses as well as an intrinsic inflammatory action in the nasal airways of perennially allergic asthmatics.

Nasal lavage was performed and blood samples obtained at four time points throughout each exposure: pre-exposure (Pre-E), 1 h into exposure (l h-E), immediately post-exposure (0h-PE) and 1 h post-exposure (l h-PE). Endobronchial mucosal biopsies were obtained at 1.5 h-post exposure (1.5 h-PE). Nasal RTLF neutrophilia was not apparent during, or 1.5 h after, O3 exposure. Furthermore, activation of the pre-existing neutrophil population did not occur. Airway permeability was not altered by this O3 exposure regimen. Sequential lavage resulted in significant washout of RTLF ascorbic acid, reduced glutathione, extracellular superoxide dismutase and myeloperoxidase at l h-E, 0 h-PE and 1.5 h-PE relative to baseline Pre-E values. In contrast, RTLF uric acid (UA), total protein and albumin concentrations did not display washout kinetics. Of the antioxidants examined, only UA was clearly depleted by O3, concentrations, falling by 6.22 ""mu""mol L-1 at l h-E, compared with 1.61 ""mu""mol L-1 (p<0.0l) during control air exposure. The establishment of a new pseudo-steady-state concentration of RTLF UA (70% of Pre-E values) during the second hour of O3 exposure was coincident with a small but significant increase in plasma UA concentration (19.27 (O3) versus 1.95 ""mu""mol L-1(air), p<0.05). These data demonstrate that inhalation of 0.2 parts per million O3 results in the depletion of nasal respiratory tract lining fluid uric acid and that this regional loss of uric acid leads to a small increase in plasma uric acid concentration. Whilst the reaction of uric acid with inspired O3 may confer protection locally, the role of upper airway uric acid as a sink for inhaled O3 is not supported by these findings."

The purpose of this study was to determine the specific tissue source of uric acid in airway secretions. The secretion of uric acid is increased by cholinergic stimulation and correlates closely with the secretion of lactoferrin (a nasal glandular protein), suggesting that submucosal glands are involved. Indeed, nasal turbinate tissue was found to contain uric acid. However, careful analysis of nasal turbinate tissue failed to reveal the presence of xanthine oxidase, the enzyme responsible for uric acid synthesis. These data suggest that uric acid might be taken up secondarily by glands from plasma. This possibility was strengthened by the observation that lowering the plasma urate level with probenecid concomitantly lowered urate secretion. These findings are consistent with the hypotheses that the principal source of uric acid in nasal secretions is plasma and that uric acid is taken up, concentrated, and secreted by nasal glands."

To understand O(3)-antioxidant interactions and the variation of these interactions among individuals, in vitro assays are needed to measure the total antioxidant capacity of airway lavage fluid, a convenient source of (diluted) mucous samples. Here, we compare the oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC), a general method that uses peroxyl radicals as a reactive substance, to the recently developed ozone specific antioxidant capacity (OZAC), a procedure that directly employs O(3). For prepared model mucous antioxidant solutions containing uric acid, ascorbic acid or glutathione, the ORAC and OZAC methods yielded comparable antioxidant capacities. The addition of EDTA or DETAPAC, necessary to prevent auto-oxidation of test solutions during the ORAC assay, unpredictably altered ORAC measurements. EDTA did not have a significant effect on OZAC measurements in either prepared uric acid or ascorbic acid solutions. When assessing antioxidant capacities of nasal lavage samples, the ORAC and OZAC assays were no longer comparable. Because the OZAC of nasal lavage samples was positively related to measured uric acid concentrations whereas the ORAC data were not, the OZAC method appears to provide more realistic mucous antioxidant capacities than the ORAC method."

In this study we examined the impact of an environmentally relevant ozone challenge on the antioxidant defenses present at the surface of the lung in two groups known to have profound differences in their antioxidant defense network: healthy control (HG) and mild asthmatic (MA) subjects. We hypothesized that baseline differences in antioxidant concentrations within the respiratory tract lining fluid (RTLF), as well as induced responses, would predict the magnitude of individual responsiveness. We observed a significant loss of ascorbate (ASC) from proximal (-45.1%, p < .01) and distal RTLFs (-11.7%, p < .05) in healthy subjects 6 h after the end of the ozone challenge. This was associated (Rs, -0.7 l,p < .01) with increased glutathione disulphide (GSSG) in these compartments (p = .01 and p < .05). Corresponding responses were not seen in asthmatics, where basal ASC concentrations were significantly lower (p < .01) and associated with elevated concentrations of GSSG (p < .05). In neither group was any evidence of lipid oxidation seen following ozone. Despite differences in antioxidant levels and response, the magnitude of ozone-induced neutrophilia (+20.6%, p < .01 [HC] vs. + 15.2%, p = .01 [MA]) and decrements in FEV1 (-8.0%, p < .01 [HG] vs. -3.2%, p < .05 [MA]) did not differ between the two groups. These data demonstrate significant differences between the interaction of ozone with RTLF antioxidants in MA and HG subjects. These responses and variations in basal antioxidant defense were not, however, useful predictive markers of group or individual responsiveness to ozone."

Thirteen healthy nonsmoking subjects were exposed in a single blinded, crossover control fashion to 0.2 parts per million (ppm) O3 and filtered air for 2 h, using a standard intermittent exercise and rest protocol. Lung function was assessed pre- and immediately post-exposure. Bronchoscopy was performed with endobronchial mucosal biopsies, bronchial wash (BW) and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) 1.5 h after the end of the exposure period. Respiratory tract lining fluid (RTLF) redox status was assessed by measuring a range of antioxidants and oxidative damage markers in BW and BAL fluid samples. There was a significant upregulation after 03 exposure in the expression of vascular endothelial P-selectin (p<0.005) and intercellular adhesion molecule-i (p<0.005). This was associated with a 2-fold increase in submucosal mast cells (p<O.005) in biopsy samples, without evidence of neutrophilic inflammation, and a decrease in HAL fluid macrophage numbers (1.6-fold, p<0.005), with an activation of the remaining macrophage subset (2.5-fold increase in % human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-DR+ cells, p<0.005). In addition, exposure led to a 4.5-fold and 3.1-fold increase of reduced glutathione (GSH) concentrations, in BW and BAL fluid respectively (p<0.05), with alterations in urate and a-tocopherol plasmalRTLF partitioning ratios (p<0.05). Spirometry showed reductions in forced vital capacity (p<0.0S) and forced expiratory volume in one second (p<0.01), with evidence of small airway narrowing using forced expiratory flow values (p<0.005). Evidence was found of O3-induced early adhesion molecule upregulation, increased submucosal mast cell numbers and alterations to the respiratory tract lining fluid redox status. No clear relationship was demonstrable between changes in these early markers and the lung function decrements observed. The results therefore indicate that the initial lung function decrements are not predictive of, or causally related to the O3-induced inflammatory events in normal human subjects."

Firstly, directly as a consequence of its oxidising character during exposure, and secondly, indirectly by engendering inflammation. In this study the second pathway was considered by ascertaining the impact of O3 on the redox state of the fluid lining the respiratory tract 6 hours after challenge. METHODS: Nine subjects were exposed in a double blind crossover control trial to air and 200 ppb O3 for 2 hours with an intermittent exercise and rest protocol. Blood samples were obtained and lung function (forced vital capacity (FVC), forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1))   assessed before, immediately after, and 6 hours after exposure. Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL)   was performed 6 hours after challenge. Inflammation was assessed in BAL fluid (total and differential cell counts, plus myeloperoxidase concentrations), and plasma and BAL fluid redox   state were determined by measuring concentrations of antioxidants and markers of oxidative   damage. RESULTS: Neutrophil numbers in BAL fluid increased 2.2-fold (p = 0.07) 6 hours after exposure and this was accompanied by increased myeloperoxidase concentrations in BAL   fluid (p = 0.08). On the other hand, BAL fluid macrophage and lymphocyte numbers decreased   2.5-fold (p = 0.08) and 3.1-fold (p = 0.08), respectively at this time. Of the antioxidants examined, only ascorbate in BAL fluid was affected by O3, falling in all subjects relative to air values (0.1 (0.0-0.3) v 0.3 (0.2-1.2) mumol/l (p = 0.008)). A marginal decrease in plasma ascorbate was also detected at this time (p < 0.05). Although the decrease in macrophage numbers seemed to be causally related to the increase in neutrophils (R = -0.79), myeloperoxidase concentrations (R = -0.93) and ascorbate concentrations (R = 0.6), no clear associations were apparent between ascorbate changes and neutrophils or myeloperoxidase concentration after O3. CONCLUSIONS: Ascorbate in the fluid lining the respiratory tract is   depleted as a consequence of O3 exposure at 6 hours after exposure. This was contemporaneous with, although not quantitatively related to the increase in neutrophil numbers and myeloperoxidase concentrations. Decreased macrophage numbers 6 hours after O3 related to the degree of neutrophilic inflammation with populations conserved where ascorbate   concentration in the fluid lining the respiratory tract were high after exposure. These results imply  that ascorbate has a critical protective role against inflammatory oxidative stress induced by O3."

The major aim of the present study was to determine whether these differences in response intensity could be accounted for by the O3 dose to the lower region of the lung. The relative O3 dose to the lower lung of groups of pregnant, lactating, and virgin female rats was estimated by measuring the incorporation of the 18O isotope into low-speed (cells) and high-speed (surfactant) pellets of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid immediately after acute exposure to 0.5-1.1 parts/million 18O3. The polymorphonuclear leukocyte (PMN) and protein inflammatory responses were established 20 h after acute exposure of identical physiological groups to 0.5-1.1 parts/million 16O3 (common isotope). A single regression of PMN inflammation data against surfactant 18O concentration for all physiological groups gave a linear relationship, indicating direct proportionality of PMN inflammation with this estimate of relative dose to the lower lung regardless of physiological status. This implies that the chemical species that react with surfactant molecules, i.e., O3 or its metabolites, are the same as or proportional to those chemical species responsible for initiating PMN inflammation. Additional experiments showed that lung tissue ascorbic acid concentration was significantly lower in pregnant and lactating rats than in virgin female rats. Although a causative relationship cannot be assumed, the deficit in tissue ascorbic acid concentration in pregnant and lactating rats compared with virgin female rats is consistent with their greater responsiveness and higher relative surfactant O3 dose."

By comparison to juvenile (2-mo-old) and adult (9-mo-old) rats, senescent animals had higher increases of interleukin-6 (up to 10-fold higher) and N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase (NAGA; 2-fold higher) in lung lavage after ozone. Ascorbic acid was lower in lungs of senescent rats (one-half of juvenile values), and acute ozone exposure brought a further decrease in lung ascorbate. Whereas alveolar protein transudation was attenuated after ozone exposure on 4 days, persistent elevation of NAGA in senescent rats suggested only partial adaptation. Injection of endotoxin did not modify the patterns of effects. Incorporation of sup 1sup 8O-ozone into macrophages and surfactant was not different between age groups, indicating that the magnified biological responses in senescent rats were not dominated by differences in internal dose of ozone.

Recent studies demonstrated that interfacial phospholipid films appreciably inhibited NO2 absorption. Because surface active phospholipids are present on alveolar and airway interfaces, we investigated the effects of interfacial films on O3 reactive absorption and acute cell injury. Compressed films of dipalmitoyl-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DPPC) and rat lung lavage lipids significantly reduced O3 reactive absorption by ascorbic acid (AH2), reduced glutathione, and uric acid. Conversely, unsaturated PC films did not inhibit O3 absorption. We evaluated O3-ediated cell injury using a human lung fibroblast cell culture system, an intermittent tilting exposure regimen to produce a thin covering layer, and nuclear fluorochrome permeability. Exposure produced negligible injury in cells covered with MEM. However, addition of AH2 produced appreciable (> 50%) cell injury. Film spreading of DPPC monolayers necessitated the use of untilted regimens. Induction of acute cell injury in untilted cultures required both AH2 plus very high O3 concentrations. Addition of DPPC films significantly reduced cell injury. We conclude that acute cell injury likely results from O3 reaction with ELF substrates. Furthermore, interfacial films of surface active, saturated phospholipids reduce the local dose of O3-derived reaction products. Finally, since O3 local dose and tissue damage likely correlate, we propose interfacial phospholipids may modulate intrapulmonary distribution of inhaled O3 and the extent of site-specific cell injury."

quality standards. In addition to its known pulmonary effects, environmental ozone
exposures have been associated with increased hospital admissions related to
cardiovascular events but to date, no studies have elucidated the potential molecular
mechanisms that may account for exposure-related vascular impacts. Because of the
known pulmonary redox and immune biology stemming from ozone exposure, we
hypothesized that ozone inhalation would initiate oxidant stress, mitochondrial damage, and
dysfunction within the vasculature. Accordingly, these factors were quantified in mice
consequent to a cyclic, intermittent pattern of ozone or filtered air (controls) exposure.
Ozone significantly modulated vascular tone regulation and increased oxidant stress and
mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) damage, which was accompanied by significantly decreased
vascular endothelial nitric oxide synthase protein and indices of nitric oxide production. To
examine influences on atherosclerotic lesion formation, apoE -/- mice were exposed as
above and aortic plaques quantified. Exposure resulted in significantly increased
atherogenesis compared to filtered air controls. Vascular mitochondrial damage was
additionally quantified in ozone- and filtered air-exposed infant macaque monkeys. These
studies revealed that ozone increased vascular mtDNA damage in non-human primates in a
fashion consistent with known atherosclerotic lesion susceptibility in humans. Consequently,
inhaled ozone, in the absence of other environmental toxicants, promotes increased vascular
dysfunction, oxidative stress, mitochondrial damage and atherogenesis."

Bronchial C-fibers (BrCs) were the lung afferents most susceptible to ozone, the activity of 10 of 11 BrCs increasing from 0.2 +/- 0.2 to 4.6 +/- 1.3 impulses/s within 1-7 min of ozone exposure. Ten of 15 rapidly adapting receptors (RARs) were stimulated by ozone, their activity increasing from 1.5 +/- 0.4 to 4.7 +/- 0.7 impulses/s. Stimulation of RARs (but not of BrCs) appeared secondary to the ozone-induced reduction of lung compliance because it was abolished by hyperinflation of the lungs. Ozone had little effect on pulmonary C-fibers or slowly adapting pulmonary stretch receptors. Our results suggest that both BrCs and RARs contribute to the tachypnea and bronchoconstriction evoked by acute exposure to ozone when vagal conduction is intact and that BrCs alone are responsible for the vagally mediated tachypnea that survives vagal cooling to 7 degrees C."

At 37 degrees C, addition of ozone to the inspired air decreased tidal volume and dynamic lung compliance and increased breathing frequency, total lung resistance, and tracheal smooth muscle tension. Ozone still evoked significant effects when conduction in myelinated vagal axons was blocked selectively by cooling the nerves to 7 degrees C. Ozone-induced effects were largely abolished when nonmyelinated vagal axons were blocked by cooling to 0 degree C, breathing during ozone inhalation at 0 degree C being generally similar to that during air breathing at 0 degree C, except that minute volume and inspiratory flow were higher. We conclude that afferent vagal C-fibers in the lower airways make a major contribution to the acute respiratory effects of ozone and that nonvagal afferents contribute to the effects that survive vagal blockade."

Several studies have investigated the role of copollutants, such as ozone (O(3)), in this association. It is accepted that physiological adaptation involving the respiratory system occurs with repeated exposures to O(3). We hypothesize that adaptation to PM and O(3) varies among different inbred mouse strains, and cardiopulmonary adaptation to O(3) is a synchronized response between the cardiac and respiratory systems. Heart rate (HR), HR variability (HRV), and the magnitude and pattern of breathing were simultaneously measured by implanted telemeters and by plethysmography in three inbred mouse strains: C57Bl/6J (B6), C3H/HeJ (HeJ), and C3H/HeOuJ (OuJ). Physiological responses were assessed during dual exposures to filtered air (FA), O(3) (576 +/- 32 parts/billion), and/or carbon black (CB; 556 +/- 34 mug/m(3)). Exposures were repeated for 3 consecutive days. While each strain showed significant reductions in HR during CB with O(3) preexposure (O(3)CB) on day 1, prominent HRV responses were observed in only HeJ and OuJ mice. Each strain also differed in their adaptation profile in response to repeated O(3)CB exposures. Whereas B6 mice showed rapid adaptation in HR after day 1, HeJ mice generally showed more moderate HR and HRV adaptation after day 2 of exposure. Unlike either B6 or HeJ strains, OuJ mice showed little evidence of HR or HRV adaptation to repeated O(3)CB exposure. Adaptation profiles between HR regulation and breathing characteristics were strongly correlated, but these associations also varied significantly among strains. These findings suggest that genetic factors determine the responsivity and adaptation of the cardiac and respiratory systems to repeated copollutant exposures. During O(3)CB exposure, adaptation of cardiac and respiratory systems is markedly synchronized, which may explain a potential mechanism for adverse effects of PM on heart function."

These responses are often characterized by primary decreases in important indices of cardiac and thermoregulatory function, along with secondary decreases in associated parameters. For example, when rats are exposed to typical experimental concentrations of ozone, they demonstrate robust and consistent decreases in heart rate (HR) ranging from 50-100 bpm, while core body temperature (Tco) often falls 1.5-2.5 degrees C. Other related indices, such as metabolism, minute ventilation, blood pressure, and cardiac output, appear to exhibit similar deficits. The magnitudes of the observed decreases may be modulated by changes in experimental conditions and appear to vary inversely with both ambient temperature and body mass. More recent studies in which both healthy and compromised rats were exposed to either particulate matter or its specific components yielded similar results. The agents studied included representative examples of ambient, combustion, and natural source particles, along with individual or combined exposures to their primary metallic constituents. In addition to the substantial decreases in HR and Tco, similar to those seen with the ozone-exposed rats, these animals also displayed numerous adverse changes in electrocardiographic waveforms and cardiac rhythm, frequently resulting in fatal outcomes. While there is only limited experimental evidence that addresses the underlying mechanism/s of these responses, there is some indication that they may be related to stimulation of pulmonary irritant receptors and that they may be at least partially mediated via the parasympathetic nervous system."

Neurochem. (2011) 117, 961-972. ABSTRACT: Ozone (O(3) ), a major component of air pollution, has considerable impact on public health. Besides the well-described respiratory tract inflammation and dysfunctions, there is accumulating evidence indicating that O(3) exposure affects brain functions. However, the mechanisms through which O(3) exerts toxic effects on the brain remain poorly understood. This work aimed at precisely characterizing CNS neuronal activation after O(3) inhalation using Fos staining in adult rat. We showed that, together with lung inflammation, O(3) exposure caused a sustained time- and dose-dependent neuronal activation in the dorsolateral regions of the nucleus tractus solitarius overlapping terminal fields of lung afferents running in vagus nerves. Furthermore, we highlighted neuronal activation in interconnected central structures such as the caudal ventrolateral medulla, the parabrachial nucleus, the central nucleus of the amygdala, the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis and the paraventricular hypothalamic nucleus. In contrast, we did not detect any neuronal activation in the thoracic spinal cord where lung afferents running in spinal nerves terminate. Overall, our results demonstrate that O(3) challenge evokes a lung inflammation that induces the activation of nucleus tractus solitarius neurons through the vagus nerves and promotes neuronal activation in stress-responsive regions of the CNS."

Ozone can impair lung function and induce respiratory symptoms through sensory neural-mediated pathways, yet the specific interaction of ozone with airway sensory nerves has yet to be elucidated. Here we demonstrate, using a vagally-innervated ex vivo tracheal-lung mouse preparation, that ozone selectively and directly evokes action potential discharge in a subset of nociceptive bronchopulmonary nerves, namely slow conducting C-fibres. Sensitivity to ozone correlated with the Transient Receptor Potential (TRP) A1 agonist, cinnamaldehyde, with ozone having no effect on cinnamaldehyde-insensitive fibres. C-fibre responses to ozone were abolished by ruthenium red (TRP inhibitor). Ozone also stimulated a subset of nociceptive sensory neurones isolated from vagal ganglia of wild-type mice, but failed to activate neurones isolated from TRPA1 knockout mice. Ozone activated HEK293 cells transfected with TRPA1, but failed to activate nontransfected HEK293 or HEK293 transfected with the capsaicin-sensitive TRPV1 channel. Thus ozone is not an indiscriminate neuronal activator, but rather it potently and selectively activates a subset of airway C-fibres by directly stimulating TRPA1."

Studies focusing on immune, smooth muscle, and airway epithelial function revealed many aspects of the disease mechanism of asthma. However, the limited efficacies of immune-directed therapies suggest the involvement of additional mechanisms in asthmatic airway inflammation. TRPA1 is an irritant-sensing ion channel expressed in airway chemosensory nerves. TRPA1-activating stimuli such as cigarette smoke, chlorine, aldehydes, and scents are among the most prevalent triggers of asthma. Endogenous TRPA1 agonists, including reactive oxygen species and lipid peroxidation products, are potent drivers of allergen-induced airway inflammation in asthma. Here, we examined the role of TRPA1 in allergic asthma in the murine ovalbumin model. Strikingly, genetic ablation of TRPA1 inhibited allergen-induced leukocyte infiltration in the airways, reduced cytokine and mucus production, and almost completely abolished airway hyperreactivity to contractile stimuli. This phenotype is recapitulated by treatment of wild-type mice with HC-030031, a TRPA1 antagonist. HC-030031, when administered during airway allergen challenge, inhibited eosinophil infiltration and prevented the development of airway hyperreactivity. Trpa1?/? mice displayed deficiencies in chemically and allergen-induced neuropeptide release in the airways, providing a potential explanation for the impaired inflammatory response. Our data suggest that TRPA1 is a key integrator of interactions between the immune and nervous systems in the airways, driving asthmatic airway inflammation following inhaled allergen challenge. TRPA1 may represent a promising pharmacological target for the treatment of asthma and other allergic inflammatory conditions. "

Environmental irritants such as mustard oil, allicin, and acrolein activate TRPA1, causing acute pain, neuropeptide release, and neurogenic inflammation. Genetic studies indicate that TRPA1 is also activated downstream of one or more proalgesic agents that stimulate phospholipase C signaling pathways, thereby implicating this channel in peripheral mechanisms controlling pain hypersensitivity. However, it is not known whether tissue injury also produces endogenous proalgesic factors that activate TRPA1 directly to augment inflammatory pain. Here, we report that recombinant or native TRPA1 channels are activated by 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal (HNE), an endogenous ?,?-unsaturated aldehyde that is produced when reactive oxygen species peroxidate membrane phospholipids in response to tissue injury, inflammation, and oxidative stress. HNE provokes release of substance P and calcitonin gene-related peptide from central (spinal cord) and peripheral (esophagus) nerve endings, resulting in neurogenic plasma protein extravasation in peripheral tissues. Moreover, injection of HNE into the rodent hind paw elicits pain-related behaviors that are inhibited by TRPA1 antagonists and absent in animals lacking functional TRPA1 channels. These findings demonstrate that HNE activates TRPA1 on nociceptive neurons to promote acute pain, neuropeptide release, and neurogenic inflammation. Our results also provide a mechanism-based rationale for developing novel analgesic or anti-inflammatory agents that target HNE production or TRPA1 activation. "

It is known that a number of natural compounds specifically activate those sensory neuronal TRP channels, and a well-known example is cinnamaldehyde for TRPA1. Here we show that human and mouse TRPA1 are activated by acetaldehyde, an intermediate substance of ethanol metabolism, in the HEK293T cell heterologous expression system and in cultured mouse trigeminal neurons. Acetaldehyde failed to activate other temperature-sensitive TRP channels expressed in sensory neurons. TRPA1 antagonists camphor and gadolinium, and a general TRP blocker ruthenium red inhibited TRPA1 activation by acetaldehyde. Camphor, gadolinium and ruthenium red also suppressed the acute nociceptive behaviors induced by the intradermal administration of acetaldehyde into the mouse footpads. Intradermal co-application of prostaglandin E2 and acetaldehyde greatly potentiated the acetaldehyde-induced nociceptive responses, and this effect was reversed by treatment with the TRPA1 antagonist camphor. These results suggest that acetaldehyde causes nociception via TRPA1 activation. Our data may also help elucidate the mechanisms underlying acetaldehyde-related pathological symptoms such as hangover pain."

Before testing an esophageal balloon was inserted, and lung volumes, flow rates, maximal inspiratory (at residual volume and functional residual capacity) and expiratory (at total lung capacity and functional residual capacity) mouth pressures, and pulmonary mechanics (static and dynamic compliance and airway resistance) were measured before and immediately after the exposure period.

For each exposure a subject inhaled either buffered saline or atropine aerosol followed by exposure either to clean air or 0.4 ppm O3. Measurements of lung mechanics, ventilatory response to exercise, and symptoms were obtained before and after exposure. O3 exposure alone resulted in significant changes in specific airway resistance, forced vital capacity (FVC), forced expiratory flow rates, tidal volume (VT), and respiratory rate (f). Atropine pretreatment prevented the significant increase in airway resistance with O3 exposure and partially blocked the decrease in forced expiratory flow rates but did not prevent a significant fall in FVC, changes in f and VT, or the frequency of reported respiratory symptoms after O3. These results suggest that the increase in pulmonary resistance during O3 exposure is mediated by a parasympathetic mechanism and that changes in other measured variables are mediated, at least partially, by mechanisms not dependent on muscarinic cholinergic receptors of the parasympathetic nervous system."

If this were so, pain suppression or inhibition by opioid-receptor agonists should partially or fully reverse O3-induced symptomatic and lung functional responses. The objectives of this study were to determine whether O3-induced pain limits maximal inspiration and whether endogenous opioids contribute to modulation of the effects of inhaled O3 on lung function. The participants in this double-blind crossover study were healthy volunteers (18u59 yr) known to be ??weak' (WR; n =20) and ??strong' O3 responders (SR; n =42). They underwent either two 2-h exposures to air or two 2-h exposures to 0.42 parts/million O3 with moderate intermittent exercise. Immediately after post-O3 spirometry, the WR were randomly given either naloxone (0.15 mg/kg iv) or saline, whereas SR randomly received either sufentanil (0.2 microgram/kg iv) or saline. O3 exposure significantly (P < 0.001) impaired lung function. In SR, sufentanil rapidly, although not completely, reversed both the chest pain and spirometric effects (forced expiratory volume in 1 s; P< 0.0001) compared with saline. Immediate postexposure administration of saline or naloxone had no significant effect on WR. Plasma b-endorphin levels were not related to an individual's O3 responsiveness.

Results showed similar reductions in FVC (Asth = 12%, Nm = 10%) and FEV1 (Asth = 13%, Nm = 11%) in Asth and Nm following ozone. Variables representing small-airways function demonstrated the greatest ozone-induced decline in Asth (FEF75 = 25%). Indomethacin pretreatment significantly attenuated ozone-induced decreases in FVC and FEV1 in Nm, but not in Asth. Marked attenuation of ozone-induced decrements in FEF75 and FEF60p was observed in Asth but not in Nm. PGF2-alpha levels were similar in both groups prior to ozone exposure with indomethacin (Asth = 65 pg/ml, Nm = 59 pg/ml), but postexposure levels in Asth were significantly elevated (118 pg/ml) compared to Nm (54 pg/ml). We conclude that COX metabolites, such as PGF2-alpha, play an important but different role in asthmatics than normals with respect to ozone-induced pulmonary function decline. Specifically, COX metabolites contribute to restrictive-type changes in normals and obstructive-type changes in small airways in asthmatics."

Ozone O3 exposure also causes decreased forced vital capacity (FVC) and forced expiratory volume after 1 s (FEV(1)), associated with cough and substernal pain on inspiration, and small increases in specific airway resistance (SRAW). The spirometric decrements are substantially blunted by pretreatment with indomethacin. Since the O3-induced decrement in FVC is due to involuntary inhibition  of  inspiration,  a role for stimulation of nociceptive respiratory tract afferents has been suggested and cyclo-oxygenase products have been hypothesized to mediate this stimulation. However, the relation (if any) between the O3-induced neutrophilic airways inflammation and decreased inspiratory capacity remains unclear. We studied the effects of pharmacologic  inhibition  of  O3-induced spirometric changes on the inflammatory changes.

Spirometry and body plethysmography were performed prior to drug administration, and before and after O3 exposure. Immediately following postexposure testing, fiberoptic bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) was performed. Neither IBU nor PLA administration changed pre-exposure lung function. O3 exposure (with PLA) caused a significant 17 percent mean decrement in FEV(1) (P <0.01) and a 56 percent increase in mean SRAW. Following IBU pretreatment, O3 exposure induced a significantly lesser mean decrement in FEV(1) (7 percent) but still a 50 percent increase in mean SRAW. IBU pretreatment significantly decreased post-O3 BAL levels of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) by 60.4 percent (P <0.05) and thromboxane B(2) (TxB(2)) by 25.5 percent (P <0.05). Of the proteins, only interleukin-6 was significantly reduced (45 percent, P <0.05) by IBU as compared to PLA pretreatment. As expected, O3 exposure produced neutrophilia in BALF. There was, however, no effect of IBU on this finding. None of the major cell types in the BALF differed significantly between pretreatments. We found no association between post-exposure changes of BALF components and pulmonary function decrements. We conclude that IBU causes significant inhibition of O3-induced increases in respiratory tract PGE(2) and TxB(2) levels concomitant with a blunting of the spirometric response. This is consistent with the hypothesis that the products of AA metabolism mediate inhibition of inspiration. However, IBU did not alter the modest SRAW response to O3."

Thus PGs may stimulate afferent nerve endings in the lungs, and there has been speculation as to which endings are involved. We have recorded impulse activity from rapidly-adapting pulmonary stretch ('irritant') receptors8,9 and afferent C-fibre endings10,11 in the lungs of anaesthetised dogs. When PGF2 was injected into the right atrium, lung 'irritant' receptors were strongly stimulated. Injection of PGEs, by contrast, caused marked and prolonged stimulation of lung C-fibres."

The present study was designed to determine if a relationship exists between O3 induced pulmonary function changes and the presence of inflammatory markers as measured in exhaled breath condensates (EBCs) obtained from O3-sensitive and nonsensitive human subjects. Eight healthy adult volunteers (4 males/4 females, age 18 to 30 years) were studied, characterized as to their ozone sensitivity and placed into 2 groups (sensitive and nonsensitive) with each group having 2 males and 2 females. Subjects completed a 20-minute EBC collection and pulmonary function test (PFT) prior to a single 60-minute bout of cycle ergometer exercise (V(E) = 50-55 L/min) while breathing filtered air (FA) or 0.35 ppm O3. Subjective symptom scores (SSSs) were collected at 6, 20, 40, and 60 minutes during exposure. An immediate postexposure PFT was performed followed by an EBC collection. Subjective symptom scores, EBCs, and PFTs were collected at 1, 4 and 8 hours post exposure. EBCs were analyzed for prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), leukotriene B4 (LTB4), 8-isoprostane, and total nitric oxide (NO) metabolites (nitrate + nitrite content). Sensitive subjects, breathing O3, had significantly greater functional decrements in PFTs, increased SSSs, and increased rapid shallow breathing as well as elevated levels of 8-isoprostane and LTB4 in EBCs compared to those breathing FA. In addition, there were significant increases in nitrate + nitrite content in both sensitive and nonsensitive subjects breathing O3 compared to FA. These results indicate that sensitive subjects have elevated arachidonic acid metabolites in EBCs compared to nonsensitive subjects after O3 inhalation."

The acute effects of the inhalation of O3 at ambient or near-ambient concentrations on bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) end points consistent with a distal lung inflammatory response have been well documented in human subjects. Animal toxicologic studies have shown that the airway is also a major site of O3-induced injury and inflammation. To date, no studies have confirmed this finding in human subjects. Effects of O3 on the proximal airways are not adequately studied by BAL, which is primarily influenced by events occurring in the terminal bronchioles and alveoli. We hypothesized that O3 causes injury and inflammation in the airways in addition to that previously documented to occur in the distal lung. We performed isolated lavage of the left mainstem bronchus and forceps biopsy of the bronchial mucosa in a group of 14 healthy, athletic subjects 18 h after exposure to 0.20 ppm O3 for 4 h during moderate exercise in order to assess this possibility. We followed an identical protocol in a similar group of 12 subjects exposed to filtered air. The mean (SD) total cell count and the lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) concentration in the isolated airway lavage were significantly greater after O3 than after air, 13.9 (20.5) versus 4.9 (5.4) cells/ml x 10(4) and 18.9 (11.2) versus 9.6 (9.0) U/L, respectively. Morphometry (2,070 neutrophils/cm2 of tissue for O3 and 330 neutrophils/cm2 of tissue for air) demonstrated that O3 exposure induced an acute inflammatory cell influx into the airway.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid was obtained less than 1 h after FA and either less than 1, 6, or 24 h after O3 exposure. FEV1 was measured before the exposures and the BAL. The first aliquot [proximal airway (PA) sample] was analyzed separately from the pooled Aliquots 2 through 4 [distal airway and alveolar surface (DAAS) sample]. The data from the PA and DAAS samples were then combined to calculate the values that would have been obtained by pooling all BAL washes. FEV1 was significantly (p less than 0.05) decreased 1 h after O3 exposure, but it returned to preexposure values at 6 and 24 h after O3. The percent of neutrophils in the PA sample was significantly elevated at less than 1 h (3.7%) at 6 h (16.5%), and at 24 h (9.2%) after O3. The percent of neutrophils in the DAAS sample and calculated pooled values were significantly elevated at 6 h (4.1 and 7.6%) and at 24 h (5.1 and 5.8%) after O3. These data demonstrate that O3-induced symptoms, FEV1 decrements, and airway neutrophilia follow different time courses and indicate that the pooling of BAL washes may obscure the detection of an O3-induced bronchiolitis. The degree of neutrophilia in the BAL did not correlate with the sensitivity of the individual subjects when measured by acute changes in FEV1, suggesting a dichotomy of pathways that result in O3-induced airway neutrophilia and pulmonary function decrements."

To evaluate this effect over a longer period, we measured isovolumetric FEFs, helium-oxygen (He-O2) volume of isoflow (VisoV), the multiple breath nitrogen washout (MBNW) curve, FRC, and RV in 24 subjects 24 h after a 130-min exposure to filtered air (FA) and O3 (0.35 ppm). Men and women were studied to test for gender-based differences in response, after first determining that menstrual-cycle phase did not itself influence response. Isovolumetric FEF25-75, Vmax50, and Vmax75 were reduced about equally at 25 min after O3 exposure (p &lt; or = 0.02) and showed no recovery at 24 h. FVC and FEV1, although still depressed after 24 h (p &lt; 0.05), showed substantial recovery (p &lt; 0.01). FRC, RV, and VisoV showed no effect of O3 exposure. No gender differences in O3 responsiveness were found. In summary, O3-induced reductions in isovolumetric flow rates, suggestive of small-airway dysfunction, may persist for 24 h following acute exposure to O3, a time-course consistent with inflammation."

Spirometry was performed at the end, 25 min and 24 h after exposure, bronchoscopy at 24 h after exposure. The percentages of neutrophils, fibrinogen, albumin, PGE2, PGF2 alpha, and kinins were elevated in BALF after O3 compared with FA. The percentage reduction in (isoV) FEF25-75 at 25 min and 24 h after administration of O3 correlated closely with the rise in fibrinogen concentrations in BALF, a marker of altered vascular permeability. Rp, a measurement dominated by very small or peripheral airways, was unaffected in 7 of 8 subjects. The absence of change in Rp might have reflected insufficient penetration of O3 into these airways to produce or sustain an effect for 24 h; alternatively, the bronchoscopic procedure which included atropine and lidocaine pretreatment may have reversed an O3 effect. An unexpected finding was the significant association between baseline Rp (after FA) and the magnitude of the spirometric response to O3. Our results suggest that small airway dysfunction in the immediate post-O3 period is a marker of lung inflammation. "

Befo re and after each exposure, pulmonary function and bronchial responsiveness to methacholine were measured and symptoms ere recorded. Ozone exposure was associated with a statistically significant decrease in forced vital capacity (FVC), forced expired volume in 1 s (FEV1), percent FEV1 (FEV1%), and forced expired flow at 25-75% FVC (FEF25-75) in both normal and asthmatic subjects.

The effect of ozone on FVC and symptom scores did not differ between the two groups. In both normal and asthmatic subjects, exposure to ozone was accompanied by a significant increase in bronchial responsiveness.

Six of 17 ASTH requested inhaled P-agonist bronchodilator prior to and/or during O-3 exposure and experienced some temporary alleviation of decrements. At end exposure, however, ASTH who were medicated had greater Os-induced decrements than those who were not medicated. ASTH who had the larger Os-induced decrements had lower baseline FEV(1)/FVC and lower baseline %predicted FEV(1). These data indicate that in ASTH, unlike NONA, some portion of O-3-induced pulmonary decrements experienced was related to bronchoconstriction, and that O-3-responsiveness for ASTH depended upon baseline airway status."

Fifteen-minute periods of rest and exercise (65 l/min minute ventilation) were alternated during the first 2 h of exposure. Coughing was observed at all levels of O3 exposure. Small changes in forced-expiratory spirometric variables [forced vital capacity (FVC), forced expiratory volume in 1 s, and mean expiratory flow rate between 25 and 75% FVC] were observed at 0.12 and 0.18 ppm O3, and larger changes were found at O3 levels greater than or equal to 0.24 ppm. Changes in tidal volume and respiratory frequency during exercise, specific airway resistance, the presence of pain on deep inspiration, and shortness of breath occurred at O3 levels greater than or equal to 0.24 ppm. In conclusion, pulmonary effects of O3 were observed at levels much lower than that for which these effects have been previously described. Stimulation of airway receptors is probably the mechanism responsible for the majority of observed changes; however, the existence of a second mechanism of action is postulated."

Rats treated with the NK-1 receptor antagonist had significantly reduced epithelial injury and epithelial proliferation compared with control rats. Sections of terminal bronchioles showed no significant difference in the number of neutrophils in airways between groups. In addition, staining ozone-exposed lung sections for active caspase 3 showed no apoptotic cells, but ethidium-positive cells colocalized with the orphan nuclear receptor, Nur77, a marker of nonapoptotic, programmed cell death mediated by the NK-1 receptor. An immortalized human airway epithelial cell line, human bronchial epithelial-1, showed no significant difference in the number of oxidant stress-positive cells during exposure to hydrogen peroxide and a range of SR140333 doses, demonstrating no antioxidant effect of the receptor antagonist.

One day after ozone airway hyperreactivity is mediated by release of eosinophil major basic protein that inhibits neuronal M(2) muscarinic receptors, resulting in increased acetylcholine release and increased smooth muscle contraction in guinea pigs. Three days after ozone, IL-1?, not eosinophils, mediates ozone-induced airway hyperreactivity, but the mechanism at this time-point is largely unknown. IL-1? increases nerve growth factor (NGF) and the tachykinin substance P, both of which are involved in neural plasticity. These experiments were designed to test whether there is a role for NGF and tachykinins in sustained airway hyperreactivity following a single ozone exposure. Guinea pigs were exposed to filtered air or ozone (2ppm, 4 hours). In anesthetized and vagotomized animals ozone potentiated vagally mediated airway hyperreactivity 24 hours later, an effect that was sustained over three days. Pretreatment with antibody to NGF completely prevented ozone-induced airway hyperreactivity three days, but not one day after ozone, and significantly reduced the number of substance P positive airway nerve bundles. Three days after ozone, NK(1) and NK(2) receptor antagonists also blocked this sustained hyperreactivity. Although the effect of inhibiting NK(2) receptors was independent of ozone, the NK(1) receptor antagonist selectively blocked vagal hyperreactivity three days after ozone. These data confirm mechanisms of ozone-induced airway hyperreactivity change over time, and demonstrate three days after ozone, there is an NGF mediated role for substance P, or another NK(1) receptor agonist, that enhances acetylcholine release, and was not present one day after ozone."

A significant inverse correlation was observed between SP immunoreactivity and: (1) percent PMNs and ciliated epithelial cells in the BALF; and (2) percent change in FEV1 following exposure to ozone. These findings indicate that short-term exposure to 0.2 ppm ozone causes epithelial shedding and stimulates subepithelial sensory nerves to release SP into the airways.

We have exposed seven (two women, five men) healthy, nonsmoking individuals (22 to 30 yr of age) to filtered air and ozone (0.25 ppm) for 1 h in an environmental chamber during heavy exercise. Bronchoscopy with airway lavage (AL) and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) was performed immediately after ozone exposure. The lavage samples were analyzed by enzyme immunoassay for SP and 8-epi-prostaglandin F2 alpha (8-epi-PGF2 alpha) (a marker for oxidative free radical reaction) and by radioimmunoassay for complement fragments. FEV1 had declined 12.4 +/- 1.9% (mean +/- SEM) as a result of ozone exposure. The AL concentration for SP and 8-epi-PGF2 alpha and BAL concentration of C3a after ozone exposure were significantly higher than after the filtered air exposure (P < 0.05). There was a significant correlation between SP and 8-epi-PGF2 alpha concentrations in the AL fluid (r2 = 0.89 and P < 0.05). There were no changes in C5a in either compartment or any of the mediators in the plasma samples. These results extend previous results from animal studies suggesting that ozone's mechanism of action is through an oxidative reaction resulting in a decreased activity of NEP in the airways with a subsequent increase in the concentration and activity of SP."

Analysis revealed a three-phase response; delay, no response detected; onset, fB began to increase; response, fB stabilized. Regression analysis was used to identify four parameters: time to onset, number of breaths at onset, cumulative inhaled dose of ozone at onset of O3-induced tachypnea, and the percent change in fB. The effect of altering O3 concentration, E, atropine treatment, and indomethacin treatment were examined. We found that the lower the O3 concentration, the greater the number of breaths at onset of tachypnea at a fixed ventilation, whereas number of breaths at onset of tachypnea remains unchanged when E is altered and O3 concentration is fixed. The cumulative inhaled dose of O3 at onset of tachypnea remained constant and showed no relationship with the magnitude of percent change in fB. Atropine did not affect any of the derived parameters, whereas indomethacin did not affect time to onset, number of breaths at onset, or cumulative inhaled dose of O3 at onset of tachypnea but did attenuate percent change in fB. The results are discussed in the context of dose response and intrinsic mechanisms of action. "

Increased MARCO expression in lungs of ozone-resistant mice suggested an additional role protecting against inhaled oxidants. After ozone exposure, MARCO-/- mice showed greater lung injury than did MARCO+/+ mice. Ozone is known to generate oxidized, proinflammatory lipids in lung lining fluid, such as 5beta,6beta-epoxycholesterol (beta-epoxide) and 1-palmitoyl-2-(9'-oxo-nonanoyl)-glycerophosphocholine (PON-GPC). Intratracheal instillation of either lipid caused substantial neutrophil influx in MARCO-/- mice, but had no effect in MARCO+/+ mice. Normal AMs showed greater uptake in vitro of beta-epoxide compared with MARCO-/- AMs, consistent with SRA function in binding oxidized lipids. SR-AI/II-/- mice showed similar enhanced acute lung inflammation after beta-epoxide or another inhaled oxidant (aerosolized leachate of residual oil fly ash). In contrast, subacute ozone exposure did not enhance inflammation in SR-AI/II-/- versus SR-AI/II+/+ mice, reflecting increased AM expression of MARCO. These data identify what we believe to be a novel function for AM SRAs in decreasing pulmonary inflammation after oxidant inhalation by scavenging proinflammatory oxidized lipids from lung lining fluids."

The relationship of these cellular responses to responses in the lower lung has not been thoroughly investigated in humans. In this study we have compared the cellular changes detected in NL with those detected in the bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) taken from the same individual. A group of 10 subjects was exposed to either filtered air or 0.4 ppm ozone (O3), with exercise, for 2 h. The NL was done prior to, immediately following, and 18 h postexposure; the BAL was done only at 18 h postexposure. A significant increase in PMN was detected in the NL immediately postexposure to O3 (7.7-fold increase; p = 0.003) and remained elevated in the 18 h post-O3 NL (6.1-fold increase; p less than 0.001). A similar increase in PMN was detected in the BAL 18 h after exposure to O3 (6.0-fold increase; p less than 0.001). The albumin levels in the NL and BAL were also similarly increased 18 h after O3 (3.9-fold and 2.2-fold, respectively). Although a qualitative correlation in the mean number of PMN existed between the upper and lower respiratory tract after O3, comparison of the NL and BAL PMN from each individual showed a significant quantitative correlation for the air data (r = 0.741; p = 0.014) but not for the O3 data (r = 0.408; p = 0.243). This study demonstrates that PMN counts in the NL can be a useful, inexpensive means of studying the acute inflammatory effect of ozone and monitoring those effects in the lower lung."

The present study was designed to compare the effects of acute ozone exposure in the nose and lungs of rats. We examined the cellular inflammatory responses in the nasal cavity and lower respiratory tract by means of nasal and bronchoalveolar lavage and morphometric quantitation of neutrophils within the nasal mucosa and pulmonary terminal bronchioloalveolar duct regions (i.e., centriacinar). Rats were exposed to 0.0, 0.12, 0.8, or 1.5 ppm ozone for 6 hr and were sacrificed immediately or 3, 18, 42, or 66 hr following exposure. Eighteen hours after exposure, increased numbers of neutrophils, as compared to controls, were recovered from nasal lavage fluid (NLF) of rats exposed to 0.12 ppm ozone. There was no change in the number of neutrophils recovered from bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) at any time after exposure. Rats exposed to 0.8 ppm ozone had more neutrophils in NLF than controls immediately after exposure, but no concomitant increase in BALF neutrophils at that time. However, as the number of neutrophils in BALF increased (maximum at 42 hr), the number of neutrophils recovered from NLF decreased (minimum at 42 hr). Rats exposed to 1.5 ppm ozone had no significant increases in nasal neutrophils in NLF at any time after exposure but had greatly increased numbers of neutrophils in BALF 3, 18, and 42 hr after exposure. The number of neutrophils recovered by nasal and bronchoalveolar lavage accurately reflected the tissue neutrophil response at sites within the nasal cavity and lung that were injured by acute ozone exposure. Our results suggest that at high ozone concentrations (0.8 and 1.5 ppm), the acute nasal inflammatory response is attenuated by a simultaneous, competing, inflammatory response within the centriacinar region of the lung. Analysis of nasal lavage fluid for changes in cellular composition may be a useful indicator of acute exposure to ambient levels of ozone, but at higher ozone levels, the nasal cellular inflammatory response may underestimate the effects of ozone on nasal and pulmonary epithelia."

We also measured the concentrations of cyclooxygenase and lipoxygenase metabolites of arachidonic acid in lavage fluid. We measured airway responsiveness to inhaled methacholine aerosol before and after each exposure and performed bronchoalveolar lavage 3 h later. We found more neutrophils in the lavage fluid from O3-exposed subjects, especially in those in whom O3 exposure produced an increase in airway responsiveness. We also found significant increases in the concentrations of prostaglandins E2, F2 alpha, and thromboxane B2 in lavage fluid from O3-exposed subjects.

Exposure to ozone at levels near the National Ambient Air Quality Standard causes respiratory symptoms, changes in lung function, and airway inflammation. Although ozone-induced changes in lung function have been well characterized in healthy individuals, the relationship between airway inflammation and changes in pulmonary function have not been prospectively examined. The purpose of this study was to determine whether individuals who differ in lung function responsiveness to ozone also differ in susceptibility to airway inflammation and injury. A secondary goal was to determine whether ozone exposure induces airway inflammation in smokers, a population known to have airway inflammation and an increased burden of toxic oxygen species.  Healthy nonsmokers (n = 56) and smokers (n = 34) were exposed to 0.22 parts per million (ppm)* ozone for 4 hours, with intermittent exercise, for the purpose of selecting ozone ""responders"" (decrement in forced expiratory volume in 1 second [FEV1] > 15%) and ""nonresponders"" (decrement in FEV1 <5%). Selected subjects then were exposed twice to ozone (0.22 ppm for 4 hours with exercise) and once to air (with the same exposure protocol), each pair of exposures separated by at least 3 weeks, in a randomized, double-blind fashion. Nasal lavage (NL) and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) were performed immediately after one ozone exposure and 18 hours after the other, and either immediately or 18 hours after the air exposure. Indicators of airway effects in lavage fluid included changes in inflammatory cells, proinflammatory cytokines, protein markers of epithelial injury and repair, and generation of toxic oxygen species.  In the classification exposure, fewer smokers than non-smokers were responsive to ozone (11.8% vs. 28.6%, respectively); an insufficient number of smoker-responders were identified to study as a separate group. In the BAL study, all groups developed a similar degree of airway inflammation, consisting of increases in interleukins 6 and 8 (maximal immediately after exposure), and increases in polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs), lymphocytes, and mast cells (maximal 18 hours after exposure). The increase in PMNs was inversely correlated with age (p = 0.013), but gender, nonspecific airway responsiveness, and allergy history were not predictive of inflammation. Alveolar macrophage production of toxic oxygen species decreased after ozone exposure in nonsmokers; however, not in smokers. Findings from nasal lavage did not mirror lower airway inflammatory responses in these studies. We conclude that, in response to ozone exposure, smokers experienced smaller decrements in lung function and fewer symptoms than nonsmokers; however, the intensity of the airway inflammatory response was independent of smoking status or airway responsiveness to ozone. Furthermore, the burden of toxic oxygen species following ozone exposure was greater for smokers than for nonsmokers. Subjects were young, healthy, and able to sustain exercise; the results may not be representative of nonsmokers or smokers in general. Nevertheless, the findings indicate that measuring symptoms and spirometric changes is not sufficient to assess the potential risks associated with ozone exposure."

Several cell types and their soluble mediators, including interleukin-1 (IL-1) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), are involved in the evolution of these responses. In this study, we have compared the effects of the combination of anti-IL-1 alpha and anti-TNF-alpha on in vitro and in vivo responses to inhaled O3. Male, Sprague-Dawley rats were exposed, nose-only, to 0.8 ppm O3 for 3 h and the in vitro and in vivo parameters were measured 8-12 h following exposure. The in vitro studies revealed that the adherence of inflammatory cells, primarily macrophages, harvested from the lungs of O3-exposed rats to cultured lung epithelial cells (ARL-14) was significantly greater than the adherence of macrophages from air-exposed controls. Furthermore, this adherence was significantly reduced in antibody-treated cells as compared to cells treated with preimmune rabbit serum. In vivo, elevations were found in the percentage of neutrophils in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF), transport of 99mTc-diethylenetriaminepentaacetate (DTPA) across the tracheal epithelium, and concentrations of total protein and albumin in BALF following O3 exposure. However, these effects were not significantly altered by treatment with the anti-IL-1 alpha/anti-TNF-alpha combination. Therefore, it was concluded that O3 affects the early stages of the inflammatory response, particularly with respect to macrophage activation and adherence to epithelial cells, and that this early response may be mediated by IL-1 alpha and/or TNF-alpha. The results also suggest that the in vivo effects of O3 are controlled by complex mechanisms involving factors other than IL-1 alpha and TNF-alpha, even though these cytokines are capable of modifying macrophage function as revealed by the in vitro adherence studies."

The purpose of this study was to determine if exposure to 0.08 parts per million ozone for 6.6h induces inflammation and modifies immune cell surface phenotypes in the airways of healthy adult subjects. Fifteen normal volunteers underwent an established 0.08 part per million ozone exposure protocol to characterize the effect of ozone on airways inflammation and immune cell surface phenotypes. Induced sputum and flow cytometry were used to assess these endpoints 24h before and 18h after exposure. The results showed that exposure to 0.08 ppm ozone for 6.6h induced increased airway neutrophils, monocytes, and dendritic cells and modified the expression of CD14, HLA-DR, CD80, and CD86 on monocytes 18h following exposure. Exposure to 0.08 parts per million ozone is associated with increased airways inflammation and promotion of antigen-presenting cell phenotypes 18 hours following exposure.

We exposed 15 mild asthmatic and 15 healthy subjects to 0A2 ppm of ozone or filtered air for 2 h on two separate occasions. Airway lavages and bronchial biopsies were obtained 6 h post-challenge. We found that ozone induced similar increases in bronchial wash neutrophils in both groups, although the neutrophil increase in the asthmatic group was on top of an elevated baseline. In healthy subjects, ozone exposure increased the expression of the vascular endothelial adhesion molecules P-selectin and ICAM-1, as well as increasing tissue neutrophil and mast cell numbers. The asthmatics showed allergic airways inflammation at baseline but ozone did not aggravate this at the investigated time point. At 6 h post-ozone-exposure, we found no evidence that mild asthmatics were more responsive than healthy to ozone in terms of exaggerated neutrophil recruitment or exacerbation of pre-existing allergic inflammation.

A mechanism for cPLA2 activity regulation through a signal transduction pathway has been proposed and this signaling appears to be influenced by oxidants. Oxidant-mediated signaling of PLA2 may serve as an alternative mechanism for enzyme regulation; however, the manner of regulation has yet to be delineated. In this report we demonstrate that there is a direct effect of membrane oxidation on cPLA2 phosphorylation and activity. A simple in vitro system consisting of purified cPLA2 and phospholipid vesicles was used to facilitate protein kinase C (PKC) activity and provide substrates for cPLA2. Using these vesicles we found that the activity of cPLA2 was enhanced twofold when the vesicles contained as little as 5 mol% phosphatidylcholine hydroperoxides (PLPCOOH). The order of hydrolytic preference for fatty acyl species was 20:4 > 18:2 > 18:1 > 16:0, and the presence of PLPCOOH stimulated hydrolysis largely of phosphatidylcholine containing 20:4. The Ca2+ concentrations required for stimulated hydrolytic activity were also twofold lower for oxidized compared to unoxidized vesicles. Using phospholipid micelles as substrates, PKC-mediated phosphorylation of cPLA2 increased hydrolytic activity 71% compared to preparations lacking PKC. Using phospholipid vesicles as substrates, PKC-mediated phosphorylation resulted in an 85% increase in cPLA2 activity compared to preparations without PKC. PKC-mediated phosphorylation of cPLA2, therefore, stimulates catalytic activity toward membrane phospholipids and the extent of activation is enhanced directly by peroxidation of membrane phospholipids and involves a peroxide-induced stimulation of cPLA2 phosphorylation."

However, because of its high reactivity, ozone cannot penetrate far into the airl lung tissue interface. It has been proposed that ozone reacts with unsaturated fatty acids (UFA) in the epithelial lining fluid (ELF) and cell membranes to generate a cascade of lipid ozonation products (LOP) that mediate ozone-induced toxicity. To test this hypothesis, we exposed cultured human bronchial epithelial cells (BEAS-2B) to LOP (1-100 ""mu""M) produced from the ozonation of 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-Phosphatidylcholine (POPC) and measured the activity of PLA2, PLC, and PLD. The PLA2 isoform responsible for arachidonic acid release (AA) in stimulated cultures was also characterized. Activation of PLA2, PLC, and PLD by three oxidants, hydrogen peroxide (H202), tert-butyl hydroperoxide (t-BOOH) and 2,2'-azobis(2-amidinopropane)dihydrochloride (AAPH) also was measured and compared to that of LOP. The derivatives of ozonized POPC at the sn-2 residue, 9-oxononanoyl (PC-ALD), 9-hydroxy-9-hydroperoxynonanoyl (PC-HHP), and 8-(-5-octyl-1,2,4-trioxolan-3yl-) octanoyl (POPC-OZ) selectively activated PLA2 in a dose-dependent fashion. Cytosolic PLA2 (cPLA2) measured in the cytosolic fraction of stimulated cell lysates was found to be the predominant isoform responsible for AA release. PLC activation was exclusively induced by the hydroxyhydroperoxide derivatives. PC-HHP and the 9-carbon hydroxyhydroperoxide (HHP-C9) increased PLC activity. PLD activity also was induced by LOP generated from POPC. Incubation of cultures with H202 alone did not stimulate PLC; however, in the presence of the aldehyde, nonanal, a 62 +/-2% increase in PLC activity was found, suggesting that the increase in activity was due to the formation of the intermediate HHP-C9. t-BOOH, and AAPH also failed to induce PLA2 activation, but did activate PLC, under conditions of exposure identical to that of LOP. Only t-BOOH activated PLD. These results suggest that biologically relevant concentrations of LOP activate PLA2,PLC, and PLD in the airway epithehial cell, a primary target to ozone exposure. The activation of these phospholipases may play a role in the development of lung inflammation during ozone exposure."

We have previously reported the time-course of ozone-induced airway inflammation, demonstrating an early up-regulation of vascular endothelial adhesion molecules in bronchial mucosa at 1.5 hours, followed by a neutrophilic infiltration 6 hours after exposure to 0.2 ppm ozone. We hypothesized that the neutrophilic infiltration in the bronchial mucosa would reflect an early increase in bronchial epithelial expression of redox-sensitive transcription factors and kinases regulating neutrophil chemoattractant expression. To test this hypothesis, endobronchial biopsies were obtained from healthy human subjects (n = 11) 1.5 hours after 0.2 ppm of ozone and filtered air exposures (lasting for 2 hours) and stained for mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), transcription factors, and neutrophil chemoattractants. Total epithelial staining was quantified, as well as the extent of nuclear translocation. Contrary to expectation, ozone significantly suppressed total and nuclear expression of nuclear factor kappaB (NFkappaB) in bronchial epithelial cells (p = 0.02 and p = 0.003 respectively). Similarly, the total staining for phosphorylated C-jun was suppressed (p = 0.021). Expression of interleukin 8 (IL-8) in the bronchial epithelium was likewise decreased after ozone (p = 0.018), while GRO-alpha, ENA-78, C-fos, p-p38, p-JNK, and p-ERK stainings were unchanged. These data suggest that the redox-sensitive NFkappaB and activator protein 1 (AP-1) pathways within the human bronchial epithelium do not seem to be involved in the early inflammatory cell recruitment pathways in healthy subjects exposed to ozone."

Methods Healthy and mild allergic asthmatic subjects (using only inhaled ""beta""2-agonists pm) were exposed for 2 h in blinded and randomized sequence to 0.2 ppm of O3 and filtered air. Bronchoscopy with bronchial mucosal biopsies was performed 6 h after exposure. Biopsies were embedded in GMA and stained with mAbs for epithelial expression of IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-8, IL-b, TNF-""alpha"", GR0-c""alpha"", granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), fractalkine and ENA-78. Results When comparing the two groups at baseline, the asthmatic subjects showed a significantly higher expression of IL-4 and IL-5. After O3 exposure the epithelial expression of IL-5, GM-CSF, ENA-78 and IL-8 increased significantly in asthmatics, as compared to healthy subjects. Conclusion The present study confirms a difference in epithelial cytokine expression between mild atopic asthmatics and healthy controls, as well as a differential epithelial cytokine response to O3. This O3-induced upregulation ofT helper type 2 (Th2)-related cytokines and neutrophil chemoat- tractants shown in the asthmatic group may contribute to a subsequent worsening of the airway inflammation, and help to explain their differential sensitivity to O3 pollution episodes."

Platelet-activating factor (PAF) is a lipid mediator released by activated mast cells, macrophages, and epithelial cells and causes pulmonary inflammation and hyperpermeability. We hypothesized that the activation of PAF receptors is central to the development of inflammation and epithelial injury induced by acute O3 exposure in mice. To test this hypothesis, O3-susceptible C57BL/6J mice were treated with a PAF-receptor antagonist, UK-74505, or vehicle either before or immediately after 3-h exposure to O3 (2 parts/million) or filtered air. Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluids were collected 6 and 24 h after exposure. Differential cell counts and protein content of the lavage were used as indicators of inflammation in the airways. O3-induced epithelial injury was assessed by light microscopy, and DNA synthesis in epithelium of terminal bronchioles was estimated by using a bromodeoxyuridine-labeling index. Intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1)expression was also examined in the lung by immunohistochemical localization. O3 caused significant increases in polymorphonuclear leukocytes and protein in the BAL fluid, increased pulmonary epithelial proliferation, and increased epithelial expression of ICAM-1 compared with air-exposed, vehicle-treated control mice. Relative to O3-exposed, vehicle-treated control mice, UK-74505 before exposure significantly (P < 0.05) decreased BAL protein, polymorphonuclear leukocytes, and epithelial cells. O3-induced inflammation was similarly attenuated in mice treated with UK-74505 after exposure. These experiments thus support the hypothesis that O3-induced airways inflammation and epithelial damage in mice are partially mediated by activation of PAF receptors, possibly through modulation of ICAM-1 expression."

Because the airway responses to O3 develop gradually, this investigation included a time-sequence analysis. Rats exposed for 3 h to 1 ppm O3 were studied at 4-h intervals up to 20 h postexposure. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BAL) was analyzed for albumin as an indicator of increased permeability, polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs) to assess the inflammatory status, macrophage inflammatory protein-2 (MIP-2, an inflammatory chemokine), and cell adhesion molecules for their role in inflammation and PMN functions. The time-related increase in albumin was matched by a similar significant increase for PMNs, MIP-2, and intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1). However, no marked change occurred for beta-2 integrin (CD-18) and leukotriene B4 (LTB4). The results establish a temporal correlation of epithelial permeability with changes in inflammatory activity and stimuli responsible for PMN recruitment in the lung. The observations of elevated MIP-2 and ICAM-1 levels are consistent with their role in injury and inflammation. An early expression of MIP-2 mRNA in BAL cells, that is, immediately post O3 exposure, and the peak increase in BAL MIP-2 levels 4 h later support the chemotactic role of MIP-2 in PMN recruitment at 4- and 12-h time points. The rapid drop in MIP-2 and ICAM-1 levels appears to signal the termination of inflammatory cell recruitment, which is accompanied by an onset of recovery."

We previously determined that mice genetically deficient in TNF response are protected from lung inflammation and epithelial injury after O(3) exposure. OBJECTIVES: The present study was designed to determine the molecular mechanisms of TNF receptor (TNF-R)-mediated lung injury induced by O(3). 

METHODS: TNF-R knockout (Tnfr(-/-)) and wild-type (Tnfr(+/+)) mice were exposed to 0.3 ppm O(3) or air (for 6, 24, or 48 h), and lung RNA and proteins were prepared. Mice deficient in p50 nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB (Nfkb1(-/-)) or c-Jun-NH(2) terminal kinase 1 (Jnk1(-/-)) and wild-type controls (Nfkb1(+/+), Jnk1(+/+)) were exposed to O(3) (48 h), and the role of NF-kappaB and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) as downstream effectors of lung injury was analyzed by bronchoalveolar lavage analyses. 

RESULTS: O(3)-induced early activation of TNF-R adaptor complex formation was attenuated in Tnfr(-/-) mice compared with Tnfr(+/+) mice. O(3) significantly activated lung NF-kappaB in Tnfr(+/+) mice before the development of lung injury. Basal and O(3)-induced NF-kappaB activity was suppressed in Tnfr(-/-) mice. Compared with Tnfr(+/+) mice, MAPKs and activator protein (AP)-1 were lower in Tnfr(-/-) mice basally and after O(3). Furthermore, inflammatory cytokines, including macrophage inflammatory protein-2, were differentially expressed in Tnfr(-/-) and Tnfr(+/+) mice after O(3). O(3)-induced lung injury was significantly reduced in Nfkb1(-/-) and Jnk1(-/-) mice relative to respective control animals. 

CONCLUSIONS: Results suggest that NF-kappaB and MAPK/AP-1 signaling pathways are essential in TNF-R-mediated pulmonary toxicity induced by O(3)."

In mice, the neutrophil chemokines KC and macrophage inflammatory protein-2 (MIP-2) are expressed in the lungs following O(3) exposure. The purpose of this study was to determine whether CXCR2, the receptor for these chemokines, is essential to O(3)-induced neutrophil recruitment, injury to lungs, and increases in respiratory system responsiveness to methacholine (MCh). O(3) exposure (1 ppm for 3 h) increased the number of neutrophils in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) of wild-type (BALB/c) and CXCR2-deficient mice. However, CXCR2-deficient mice had significantly fewer emigrated neutrophils than did wild-type mice. The numbers of neutrophils in the blood and concentrations of BALF KC and MIP-2 did not differ between genotypes. Together, these data suggest CXCR2 is essential for maximal chemokine-directed migration of neutrophils to the air spaces. In wild-type mice, O(3) exposure increased BALF epithelial cell numbers and total protein levels, two indirect measures of lung injury. In contrast, in CXCR2-deficient mice, the number of BALF epithelial cells was not increased by O(3) exposure. Responses to inhaled MCh were measured by whole body plethysmography using enhanced pause as the outcome indicator. O(3) exposure increased responses to inhaled MCh in both wild-type and CXCR2-deficient mice 3 h after O(3) exposure. However, at 24 h after exposure, responses to inhaled MCh were elevated in wild-type but not CXCR2-deficient mice. These results indicate CXCR2 is essential for maximal neutrophil recruitment, epithelial cell sloughing, and persistent increases in MCh responsiveness after an acute O(3) exposure."

Airway responsiveness to methacholine was measured by whole body plethysmography before and following acute (3 h) or subacute (72 h) exposure to 0.3 ppm O(3). Acute O(3) exposure caused AHR in both groups of mice, but there was no genotype-related difference in the magnitude of O(3)-induced AHR. AHR was absent in mice of either genotype exposed for 72 h.

An early inflammatory response induced by inhaled O(3) is characterized primarily by release of inflammatory mediators such as cytokines, chemokines, and airway neutrophil accumulation. Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) have been implicated in the pathogenesis of oxidative lung disorders including acute lung injury, asthma, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. OBJECTIVE: We hypothesized that MMPs have an important role in the pathogenesis of O(3)-induced airway inflammation. METHODS: We compared the lung injury responses in either Mmp7- (Mmp7(-/-)) or Mmp9-deficient (Mmp9(-/-)) mice and their wild-type controls (Mmp7(+/+), Mmp9(+/+)) after exposure to 0.3 ppm O(3) or filtered air. RESULTS: Relative to air-exposed controls, MMP-9 activity in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) was significantly increased by O(3) exposure in Mmp9(+/+) mice. O(3)-induced increases in the concentration of total protein (a marker of lung permeability) and the numbers of neutrophils and epithelial cells in BALF were significantly greater in Mmp9(-/-) mice compared with Mmp9(+/+) mice.

Mean BALF protein concentration and numbers of inflammatory cells were not significantly different between Mmp7(+/+) and Mmp7(-/-) mice after O(3) exposure. CONCLUSIONS: Results demonstrated a protective role of MMP-9 but not of MMP-7, in O(3)-induced lung neutrophilic inflammation and hyperpermeability. The mechanism through which Mmp9 limits O(3)-induced airway injury is not known but may be via posttranscriptional effects on proinflammatory CXC chemokines including KC and MIP-2."

Methods: Il10-deficient (Il10?/?) and wild-type (Il10+/+) mice were exposed to 0.3 ppm O3 or filtered air for 24, 48, or 72 hr. Immediately after exposure, differential cell counts and total protein (a marker of lung permeability) were assessed from bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF). mRNA and protein levels of cellular mediators were determined from lung homogenates. We also used global mRNA expression analyses of lung tissue with Ingenuity Pathway Analysis to identify patterns of gene expression through which IL-10 modifies O3-induced inflammation. Results: Mean numbers of BALF polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs) were significantly greater in Il10?/? mice than in Il10+/+ mice after exposure to O3 at all time points tested. O3-enhanced nuclear NF-?B translocation was elevated in the lungs of Il10?/? compared with Il10+/+ mice. Gene expression analyses revealed several IL-10?dependent and O3-dependent mediators, including macrophage inflammatory protein 2, cathepsin E, and serum amyloid A3. Conclusions: Results indicate that IL-10 protects against O3-induced pulmonary neutrophilic inflammation and cell proliferation. Moreover, gene expression analyses identified three response pathways and several genetic targets through which IL-10 may modulate the innate and adaptive immune response. These novel mechanisms of protection against the pathogenesis of O3-induced pulmonary inflammation may also provide potential therapeutic targets to protect susceptible individuals."

In primary and transformed epithelial cells from all levels of human or rat airways, ozone levels relevant to air pollution (50-200 ppb) increased extracellular [ATP] within 7-30 min. A human bronchial epithelial cell line (16HBE14o(-)) that forms electrically resistant polarized monolayers had up to 10-fold greater apical than basolateral surface extracellular [ATP] within 7 min of ozone exposure. Increased extracellular [ATP] appeared due to ATP secretion or release because (1) inhibition of ectonucleotidase (cell surface enzyme(s) which degrade ATP) by ozone did not occur until >120 min of ozone exposure and (2) brefeldin A, a secretory inhibitor, eliminated elevation of extracellular [ATP] without affecting intracellular ATP. Extracellular ATP protected against ozone toxicity in a P2Y receptor-dependent manner as (1) removal of ATP and adenosine by apyrase and adenosine deaminase, respectively, potentiated ozone toxicity, (2) extracellular supplementation with ATP, a poorly hydrolyzable ATP analog ATPgammaS, or UTP inhibited apoptotic and necrotic ozone-mediated cell death, and (3) ATP-mediated protection was eliminated by P2 and P2Y receptor inhibitors suramin and Cibacron blue (reactive blue 2), respectively. The decline in glucose uptake caused by prolonged ozone exposure was prevented by supplemental extracellular ATP, an effect blocked by suramin. Further, Akt and ERK phosphorylation resulted from exposure to supplemental extracellular ATP. Thus, extracellularly released ATP signals to prevent ozone-induced death and supplementation with ATP or its analogs can augment protection, at least in part via Akt and /or ERK signaling pathways and their metabolic effects."

However, clinical trials revealed that aerosolized nucleotides provide only a transient improvement of MCC to patients diagnosed with cystic fibrosis (CF). In this study, we identified the mechanism that eliminates extracellular nucleotides from human airways. Polarized primary cultures of human bronchial epithelial cells were impermeable to extracellular nucleotides but rapidly dephosphorylated ATP into ADP, AMP, and adenosine. The half-life of a therapeutic ATP concentration (0.1 mm) was approximately 20 s within the periciliary liquid layer. The mucosal epithelial surface eliminated P2 receptor agonists (ATP = UTP > ADP > UDP) at 3-fold higher rates than the serosal surface. We also showed that mucosal (not serosal) ectoATPase activity increases toward areas most susceptible to airway obstruction (nose < bronchi << bronchioles). Bronchial cultures from patients with CF, primary ciliary dyskinesia, or alpha1-antitrypsin deficiency exhibited 3-fold higher mucosal (not serosal) ectoATPase activity than normal cultures. Time course experiments indicated that CF enhances ATP elimination and adenosine accumulation on the mucosal surface. Furthermore, nonspecific alkaline phosphatase was identified as the major regulator of airway nucleotide concentrations in CF, primary ciliary dyskinesia, and alpha1-antitrypsin deficiency. The ectoAT-Pase activity and mRNA expression of mucosally restricted nonspecific alkaline phosphatase were 3-fold higher on bronchial cultures from these patients than from healthy subjects. This study demonstrates that the duration of nucleotide-mediated MCC is limited by epithelial ectonucleotidases throughout human airways, with the efficiency of this mechanism enhanced in chronic inflammatory lung diseases, including CF."

In a model of asbestos inhalation, Nalp3-/- mice showed diminished recruitment of inflammatory cells to the lungs, paralleled by lower cytokine production. Our findings implicate the Nalp3 inflammasome in particulate matter-related pulmonary diseases and support its role as a major proinflammatory ""danger"" receptor."

Objective: To examine the relationships between airway purine metabolites and established inflammatory markers of ozone exposure, and to determine if these relationships are altered in individuals with atopy or asthma. Materials and methods: Mass spectrometry was utilized to measure concentrations of purine metabolites (adenosine monophosphate [AMP], adenosine, hypoxanthine, uric acid) and non-purine metabolites (taurine, urea, phenylalanine, tyrosine) in induced sputum obtained from 31 subjects with normal lung function (13 healthy controls, eight atopic nonasthmatics, and 10 atopic asthmatic [AA]) before and 4?h after ozone exposure. Results: At baseline, the purines AMP and hypoxanthine correlated with multiple inflammatory markers including neutrophil counts and the cytokines interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-?), and IL-1? (r ranged from 0.41 to 0.66, all P?&lt;?0.05). Following ozone exposure, these purines remained correlated with IL-6, IL-8, and TNF-? (r?=?0.37-0.68). However, AMP and hypoxanthine increased significantly post ozone exposure in atopic nonasthmatics but not in AA. In contrast, the non-purine metabolite taurine correlated with baseline neutrophil counts (r?=?0.56) and IL-6 (r?=?0.53) and was elevated post-exposure in both atopic cohorts. Discussion and conclusions: The purine metabolites AMP and hypoxanthine are correlated with multiple inflammatory markers at baseline and after ozone exposure. However, changes in these purine metabolites after ozone appear to differ from other inflammatory markers, with less response in AA relative to atopic nonasthmatics. Purine metabolites may play a role in the signaling responses to ozone, but these responses may be altered in subjects with asthma."

In this study, we investigated the requirement of toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) in mice for pulmonary responses to three environmental toxins: aerosolized lipopolysaccharide, particulate matter (residual oil fly ash), and ozone. The physiologic and biologic responses to these toxins were evaluated by the extent of airway responsiveness, neutrophil recruitment to the lower respiratory tract, changes in inflammatory cytokines, and the concentration of protein in the lavage fluid. Genetically engineered, TLR4-deficient mice (C57BL/6(TLR4-/-)) were unresponsive to inhaled lipopolysaccharide, except for minimal increases in some inflammatory cytokines. In contrast, C57BL/6(TLR4-/-) mice did not differ from wild-type mice in their airway response to instilled residual oil fly ash or acute ozone exposure; however, we found that, despite a robust inflammatory response, C57BL/6(TLR4-/-) mice are protected against the development of airway hyperresponsiveness after subchronic ozone exposure. These data demonstrate in the mouse that the requirement of TLR4 for pulmonary inflammation depends on the nature of the toxin and appears specific to toxin and exposure conditions."

Toll-like receptors (TLR) are first-line effector molecules in innate immunity to infections and signal via adapter proteins, including myeloid differentiation factor-88 (MyD88). We investigated the sensing of ozone by TLR2, TLR4, and MyD88. Ozone induced AHR in wild-type (WT) C57BL/6 mice, but AHR was absent in TLR2?/?, TLR4?/?, and MyD88?/? mice. Bronchoalveolar lavage neutrophilia induced by ozone was inhibited at 3 h but not at 24 h in TLR2?/? and TLR4?/? mice, while in MyD88?/? mice, this was inhibited at 24 h. We investigated the expression of inflammatory cytokines and TLR2, TLR4, and MyD88 in these mice. Ozone induced time-dependent increases in inflammatory gene expression of keratinocyte chemoattractant (KC) and IL-6 and of TLR2, TLR4, and MyD88 in WT mice. IL-6 and KC expression induced by ozone was inhibited in TLR2?/?, TLR4?/?, and MyD88?/? mice. Expression of MyD88 was increased in TLR2?/? and TLR4?/? mice, while induction of TLR2 or TLR4 was reduced in TLR2?/? and TLR4?/? mice, respectively. TLR2 and TLR4 mediate AHR induced by oxidative stress such as ozone, while the adapter protein MyD88, but not TLR2 or TLR4, is important in mediating ozone-induced neutrophilia. TLR2 and TLR4 may also be important in regulating the speed of neutrophilic response. Therefore, ozone may induce murine AHR and neutrophilic inflammation through the activation of the Toll-like receptor pathway that may sense noninfectious stimuli such as oxidative stress."

The mechanisms, which regulate ozone-induced airway hyperresponsiveness, remain poorly understood. We have previously reported that toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4)-deficient animals are protected against ozone-induced airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR) and that hyaluronan (HA) mediates ozone-induced AHR. However, the relation between TLR4 and hyaluronan in the airway response to ozone remains unexplored. OBJECTIVES: We hypothesized that HA acts as an endogenous TLR4 ligand for the development of AHR after ozone-induced environmental airway injury. METHODS: TLR4-deficient and wild-type C57BL/6 mice were exposed to either inhaled ozone or intratracheal HA and the inflammatory and AHR response was measured. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: TLR4-deficient mice have similar levels of cellular inflammation, lung injury, and soluble HA levels as those of C57BL/6 mice after inhaled ozone exposure. However, TLR4-deficient mice are partially protected from AHR after ozone exposure as well as after direct intratracheal instillation of endotoxin-free low molecular weight HA. Similar patterns of TLR4-dependent cytokines were observed in the bronchial alveolar lavage fluid after exposure to either ozone or HA. Exposure to ozone increased immunohistological staining of TLR4 on lung macrophages. Furthermore, in vitro HA exposure of bone marrow-derived macrophages induced NF-kappaB and production of a similar pattern of proinflammatory cytokines in a manner dependent on TLR4. CONCLUSIONS: Our observations support the observation that extracellular matrix HA contributes to ozone-induced airways disease. Furthermore, our results support that TLR4 contributes to the biological response to HA by mediating both the production of proinflammatory cytokines and the development of ozone-induced AHR."

The mechanisms, which regulate ozone-induced bronchoconstriction, remain poorly understood. Hyaluronan was recently shown to play a central role in the response to noninfectious lung injury. Therefore, we hypothesized that hyaluronan contributes to airway hyperreactivity (AHR) after exposure to ambient ozone. Using an established model of ozone-induced airways disease, we characterized the role of hyaluronan in airway hyperresponsiveness. The role of hyaluronan in response to ozone was determined by using therapeutic blockade, genetically modified animals, and direct challenge to hyaluronan. Ozone-exposed mice demonstrate enhanced AHR associated with elevated hyaluronan levels in the lavage fluid. Mice deficient in either CD44 (the major receptor for hyaluronan) or inter-alpha-trypsin inhibitor (molecule that facilitates hyaluronan binding) show similar elevations in hyaluronan but are protected from ozone-induced AHR. Mice pretreated with hyaluronan-binding peptide are protected from the development of ozone-induced AHR. Overexpression of hyaluronan enhances the airway response to ozone. Intratracheal instillation of endotoxin-free low molecular weight hyaluronan induces AHR dependent on CD44, whereas instillation of high molecular weight hyaluronan protects against ozone-induced AHR. In conclusion, we demonstrate that hyaluronan mediates ozone-induced AHR, which is dependent on the fragment size and both CD44 and inter-alpha-trypsin inhibitor. These data support the conclusion that pulmonary matrix can contribute to the development of airway hyperresponsiveness."

Hyaluronan fragments isolated from serum of individuals with acute lung injury stimulated macrophage chemokine production in a TLR4- and TLR2-dependent manner. Myd88-/-  and Tlr4-/-Tlr2-/- mice showed impaired transepithelial migration of inflammatory cells but decreased survival and enhanced epithelial cell apoptosis after lung injury. Lung epithelial cell?specific overexpression of high-molecular-mass hyaluronan was protective against acute lung injury. Furthermore, epithelial cell?surface hyaluronan was protective against apoptosis, in part, through TLR-dependent basal activation of NF-kappaB.

In the present study, we investigated the effect of inhalation of O(3) on levels of F(2)-isoprostanes in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) and on levels of antioxidants in the BALF and plasma of hamsters. Because antioxidants, including urate, ascorbate, GSH, and vitamin E, defend the lungs by reacting with oxidizing agents, we expected to find a decrease in antioxidant levels after O(3) exposure. Similarly, we expected an increase in the levels of F(2)-isoprostanes, which are lipid peroxidation products. Exposure to 1.0 or 3.0 parts/million (ppm) O(3) for 6 h resulted in an increase in BALF neutrophil numbers, an indicator of acute inflammation, as well as elevation of BALF F(2)-isoprostanes. The higher dose of O(3) caused an increase in the BALF level of urate and a decrease in the plasma level of ascorbate, but 1.0 ppm O(3) had no effect on BALF or plasma antioxidant levels. Exposure to 0.12 ppm O(3) had no effect on BALF neutrophils or F(2)-isoprostanes nor on BALF and plasma antioxidants. We also investigated the effect of O(3) exposure of hamsters during exercise on F(2)-isoprostane and antioxidant levels. We found that exposure to 1.0 ppm O(3) during 1 h of exercise on a laddermill increased BALF levels of F(2)-isoprostanes but had no effect on BALF neutrophils or on BALF and plasma antioxidants.

After 3 wk of dietary adaptation, animals were exposed by inhalation to 2.0 ppm ozone (O3) for 2 hor chamber air and evaluated for cellular and biochemical indices of pulmonary toxicity. Compared to air controls, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) from O3 exposed ad libitum fed rats contained increased protein (145 versus 380mug/ml), PMN infiltration (0 versus 11%) and fibronectin (45 versus 607 U/ml). Diet restriction abrogated these indicators of pulmonary inflammation induced by ozone. Binding of 18O3 to BALF protein and cells was significantly decreased in diet restricted rats while BALF ascorbate and glutathione levels, but not alpha-tocopherol or urate, were elevated compared to ad libitum fed rats. Taken together, these results indicate that dietary restriction affords protection against O3-induced oxidant toxicity. Protection is mediated partially by increases in ascorbate inthe fluid bathing the lung surface, thereby providing an antioxidant sink which minimizes the ability of O3 to reach biological targets."

Twenty-one healthy and 15 asthmatic subjects participated in the study.

The decrease in FEV1 in both groups (p , 0.01), was also reproducible (r = 0.77, p < 0.001), but there were no correlations between changes in sputum parameters and lung function. Exposure to 125 ppb ozone caused a small increase (p , 0.05) in the percentage of neutrophils in asthmatic subjects and in the concentrations of interleukin-8 in both groups combined. Our data demonstrate that inflammatory and lung function responses to ozone differ between individuals and are reproducible but not related to each other. Therefore, these responses appear to represent two independent factors underlying the airway response to ozone."

Therefore, it is important to determine if a prolonged exposure to low levels of ozone is also capable of causing cellular and biochemical changes in the lung. Nonsmoking males were randomly exposed to filtered air and either 0.10 ppm ozone or 0.08 ppm ozone for 6.6 h with moderate exercise (40 liters/min). Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) was performed 18 h after each exposure, and cells and fluid were analyzed. The BAL fluid of volunteers exposed to 0.10 ppm ozone had significant increases in neutrophils (PMNs), protein, prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), fibronectin, interleukin-6 (IL-6), and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) compared with BAL fluid from the same volunteers exposed to filtered air. In addition, there was a decrease in the ability of alveolar macrophages to phagocytize yeast via the complement receptor. Exposure to 0.08 ppm ozone resulted in significant increases in PMNs, PGE2, LDH, IL-6, alpha 1-antitrypsin, and decreased phagocytosis via the complement receptor. However, BAL fluid protein and fibronectin were no longer significantly elevated. We conclude that exposure of humans to as low a level as 0.08 ppm for 6.6 h is sufficient to initiate an inflammatory reaction in the lung."

Sloughing of epithelial tissue, mucous formation and an accumulation of macrophages in the end-airways were more pronounced among ozone-exposed DS animals than in DR-ozone-exposed rats. This increased damage among DS rats correlated well with the increased protein permeability levels. In similar studies, Sprague-Dawley (D) rats were more variable in their response to ozone than either inbred strain. However, the results appeared generally more like those of the DS animals, suggesting that the trait selected by inbreeding may have been resistance rather than sensitivity to ozone-induced lung injury."

The rate of appearance of the [3H]histamine in the plasma during inhalation challenge was used to estimate airway permeability. To perturb the airways, conscious sheep were exposed to either 0.5 or 1.0 ppm O3 for 2 hr via an endotracheal tube. Airway responsiveness and airway permeability were measured prior to and 1 day after exposure. In six sheep exposed to 0.5 ppm O3, increased airway responsiveness and airway permeability were observed 1 day after exposure. Four of seven sheep exposed to 1.0 ppm O3 had enhanced airway responsiveness and airway permeability, while the remaining three sheep showed corresponding decreases in airway responsiveness and airway permeability. Since the O3-induced directional changes in airway responsiveness paralleled the directional changes in airway permeability in both the positive and negative directions, it was concluded that changes in airway responsiveness to inhaled histamine following exposure to O3 may be related to concomitant changes in airway permeability to this agent."

To test this, we measured by gamma-camera imagery the clearance kinetics in healthy subjects (n = 9) of 99mTc-labeled solute [diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (DTPA)] that was deposited by aerosol onto epithelial surfaces 19 +/- 1 h after a single exposure to ozone (O3; 130 min at ambient levels between 150 and 350 parts per billion and alternate periods of rest and moderate exercise) or filtered air. At the late period, the lung clearance of 99mTc-DTPA over a 120-min period was significantly increased, i.e., 0.732%/min for O3 exposures compared with 0.661%/min for filtered-air exposures (P < 0.05). Regional analysis demonstrated that 99mTc-DTPA clearance from the periphery (excluding the lung hilum) and lung apexes were significantly increased by O3 but changes in clearance for the base of the lung were not significant. The forced expiratory volume in 1 s at the late time after O3 was slightly but significantly reduced (-2.1%) from preexposure levels. There was no relationship between the functional changes observed acutely after exposure to O3 and subsequent changes in 99mTc-DTPA clearance or forced expiratory volume in 1 s observed at the late period. These results suggest that epithelial permeability of the lung is altered 18-20 h post-O3; this injury is regional, and the lung base appears to have a different time course of response or is in an adapted state with respect to O3 exposure."

O3 treatment significantly decreased the clearance halftime (t50)of 99m Tc-DTPA by 50% from the baseline mean of 32.3 to 16.0 min at 1 day postexposure. After 7 days of recovery, t50 was still reduced by 28.8%; however, by 14 days postexposure, clearance of 99m Tc-DTPA had recovered, and the t50 had a mean value of 30.0 min. 99m Tc-DTPA clearance was not altered by exposure to filtered air, and t50 values were comparable to baseline at 1, 7, and 14 days postexposure. These results reveal that a single local exposure to O3 increases transepithelial clearance, but only for epithelia directly exposed to O3, and that 7-14 days of recovery are required before permeability to small-molecular-weight solutes returns to normal."

Wistar rats were administered either a CGRP-receptor antagonist (CGRP8?37) or saline and exposed to 8 hours of 1-ppm ozone or filtered air with an 8-hour postexposure period. Immediately after exposure, ethidium homodimer was instilled into lungs as a marker of necrotic airway epithelial cells. After fixation, airway dissected lung lobes were stained for 5'-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine, a marker of epithelial proliferation. Positive epithelial cells were quantified in specific airway generations. Rats treated with CGRP8?37 had significantly reduced epithelial injury in terminal bronchioles and reduced epithelial proliferation in proximal airways and terminal bronchioles. Bronchoalveolar lavage and sections of terminal bronchioles showed no significant difference in the number of neutrophils emigrating into airways in CGRP8?37-treated rats. The airway epithelial cell line, HBE-1, showed no difference in the number of oxidant stress positive cells during exposure to hydrogen peroxide and a range of CGRP8?37 doses, demonstrating no antioxidant effect of CGRP8?37. We conclude that activation of CGRP receptors during ozone inhalation contributes to airway epithelial injury and subsequent epithelial proliferation, a critical component of repair, but does not influence neutrophil emigration into airways.

Among inbred strains of mice, there is a 3-fold difference in total protein (a marker of permeability) recovered in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid after a 72-h exposure to 0.3 ppm O3. To determine the chromosomal locations of susceptibility genes, we per- formed a genome screen using recombinant inbred (RI) strains of mice derived from 03-susceptible C57BL/6J (B6) and O3-resistant C3H/HeJ (Hej) progenitors. Each RI strain was phenotyped for O3-induced hyperpermeability, and linkage was assessed for 558 markers using Map Manager QTb27. A significant quantitative trait locus (QTL) was identified on chromosome 4. The likelihood ratio x2 statistic (16.6) for the peak of the QTL was greater than the significance threshold (16.3) determined empirically by permutation test. This QTL contains a candidate gene, Toll-like receptor 4 (TIr4), that recently has been implicated in innate immunity and endotoxin susceptibility. The amount of the total trait variance explained by the QTL at TIr4, the gene with the highest likelihood ratio statistic in the QTL, was approximately 70%. To test the role of TIr4 in O3-induced hyperpermeability, BAL protein responses to O3 were compared in C3H/Heouj (OuJ) and HeJ mice that differ only at a polymorphism in the coding region of TIr4. Significantly greater protein concentrations (430 +/- 35 ""mu""g/ml) were found in Ouj mice compared with Hej mice (258 +/- 18 ""mu""g/ml) after exposure to O3. Furthermore, reverse transcriptase/polymerase chain reaction analysis demonstrated differential expression of TIr4 message levels between HeJ and Ouj mice after O3 exposure. Together, results indicate that a QTL on mouse chromosome 4 explains a significant portion of the genetic variance in O3-induced hyperpermeability, and support a role for TIr4 as a strong candidate susceptibility gene."

Pretreatment of O3-susceptible C57BL/6J mice with a specific inhibitor of total NOS (N(G)-monomethyl-L-arginine) significantly decreased the mean lavageable protein concentration (a marker of lung permeability) induced by O3 (0.3 parts/million for 72 h) compared with vehicle control mice. Furthermore, lavageable protein in C57BL/B6 mice with targeted disruption of Nos2 [Nos2(-/-)] was 50% less than the protein in wild-type [Nos2(+/+)] mice after O3. To determine whether Tlr4 modulates Nos2 mRNA levels, we studied C3H/HeJ (HeJ) and C3H/HeOuJ mice that differ only at a missense mutation in Tlr4 that confers resistance to O3-induced lung hyperpermeability in the HeJ strain. Nos2 and Tlr4 mRNA levels were significantly reduced and correlated in resistant HeJ mice after O3 relative to those in susceptible C3H/HeOuJ mice. Together, the results are consistent  with  an  important  role  for iNOS in O3-induced lung hyperpermeability and suggest that Nos2 mRNA levels are mediated through Tlr4."

Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) is involved in ozone (O3)-induced pulmonary hyperpermeability and inflammation, though the downstream signaling events are unknown. Objectives. The aims of our study were to determine the mechanism through which TLR4 modulates O3-induced pulmonary responses and to utilize transcriptomics to determine potential TLR4 effector molecules. Methods. C3H/HeJ (HeJ; Tlr4 mutant) and C3H/HeOuJ (OuJ; Tlr4 normal) mice were exposed continuously to 0.3 ppm O3 or filtered air for 6, 24, 48 or 72 hr. Inflammation was assessed by bronchoalveolar lavage and molecular analysis by mRNA microarray, quantitative RT-PCR, immunoblots, immunostaining, and ELISAs. Results. O3-induced TLR4 signaling occurred through MYD88-dependent and independent pathways in OuJ mice, and involved multiple downstream pathways. Genome-wide transcript analyses of air- and O3-exposed HeJ and OuJ lungs identified a significantly upregulated cluster of genes in OuJ mice compared to HeJ mice or air that included heat shock proteins (e.g. Hspa1b; Hsp70). Furthermore, O3-induced expression of HSP70 protein was significantly increased in OuJ compared to HeJ mice. Moreover, O3-induced inflammation and MYD88 upregulation, ERK1/2 and AP-1 activation, and KC protein content were significantly reduced in Hspa1a/Hspa1btm1Dix (Hsp70-/-) compared to Hsp70+/+ mice (p<0.05). Conclusions. These studies suggest that HSP70 is an effector molecule downstream of TLR4, and is involved in the regulation of O3-induced lung inflammation by triggering similar pathways to TLR4. These novel findings may have therapeutic and preventive implications for inflammatory diseases resulting from environmental exposures."

Ozone-induced lung hyperpermeability, as measured by total protein concentration in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, was surprisingly lower in Gclm(?/?) mice than in wild-type mice. Lung hyperpermeability did not correlate with the degree of neutrophilia or with inflammatory gene expression. Pulmonary antioxidant response to ozone, assessed by increased mRNA levels of metallothionein 1 and 2, ?-tocopherol transporter protein, and solute carrier family 23 member 2 (sodium-dependent vitamin C transporter) was greater in Gclm(?/?) mice than in Gclm(+/+) mice.

Mice homozygous for a null allele of the CCSP gene (CCSP-/-) and wild type (CCSP+/+) littermates were exposed to ozone (0.2 ppm, 8 h; 1 ppm, 8 h) or filtered air. Injury was evaluated by light and scanning electron microscopy, and the abundance of necrotic, ciliated, and nonciliated cells was estimated by morphometry. Proximal and midlevel intrapulmonary airways and terminal bronchioles were evaluated. There was no difference in airway epithelial composition between CCSP+/+ and CCSP-/- mice exposed to filtered air, and exposure to 0.2 ppm ozone caused little injury to the epithelium of both CCSP+/+ and CCSP-/- mice. After exposure to 1.0 ppm ozone, CCSP-/- mice suffered from a greater degree of epithelial injury throughout the airways compared to CCSP+/+ mice. CCSP-/- mice had both ciliated and nonciliated cell injury. Furthermore, lack of CCSP was associated with a shift in airway injury to include proximal airway generations. Therefore, we conclude that CCSP modulates the susceptibility of the epithelium to oxidant-induced injury. Whether this is due to the presence of CCSP on the acellular lining layer surface and/or its intracellular distribution in the secretory cell population needs to be defined."

Surfactant protein-A (SP-A) plays a role in host defense, the regulation of inflammation, and repair of tissue damage. We tested the hypothesis that the lungs of SP-A(?/?) (KO) mice are more susceptible to ozone-induced damage. We compared the effects of ozone on KO and wild type (WT) mice on the C57BL/6 genetic background by exposing them to 2 parts/million of ozone for 3 or 6 h and sacrificing them 0, 4, and 24 h later. Lungs were subject to bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) or used to measure endpoints of oxidative stress and inflammation. Despite more total protein in BAL of KO mice after a 3 h ozone exposure, WT mice had increased oxidation of protein and had oxidized SP-A dimers. In KO mice there was epithelial damage as assessed by increased LDH activity and there was increased phospholipid content. In WT mice there were more BAL PMNs and elevated macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)-2 and monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP)-1. Changes in MIP-2 and MCP-1 were observed in both KO and WT, however mRNA levels differed. In KO mice MIP-2 mRNA levels changed little with ozone, but in WT levels they were significantly increased. In summary, several aspects of the inflammatory response differ between WT and KO mice. These in vivo findings appear to implicate SP-A in regulating inflammation and limiting epithelial damage in response to ozone exposure."

Bronchial reactivity was assessed by measuring the rise in specific airway resistance (delta SRaw) produced by inhalation of 10 breaths of histamine aerosol (1.6% solution). In 5 subjects, bronchial reactivity was determined at 9:00 and 11:30 A.M. on 4 consecutive days without exposure to ozone (Group I). In 7 other subjects (Group II), bronchial reactivity was assessed at 9:00 and 11:30 A.M. on 3 consecutive days, and subjects were exposed to 0.2 ppm of ozone from 9:30 to 11:30 A.M. on the third day. Seven additional subjects (Group III) had bronchial reactivity assessed in a similar fashion for 2 days and then again on 3 consecutive days of 2-h exposures to 0.4 ppm of ozone. Pre-exposure bronchial reactivity of the groups was the same, and no change in bronchial reactivity occurred in the group tested repeatedly but not exposed to ozone. An increase in delta SRaw provoked by histamine was noted after the first exposure to 0.4 ppm but not to 0.2 ppm of ozone (p less than 0.025). With 3 repeated 2-h exposures to 0.4 ppm on consecutive days, however, the delta SRaw produced by histamine progressively decreased, returning to pre-exposure values after the third exposure. Our results indicate that the threshold concentration of ozone causing an increase in bronchial reactivity in healthy human subjects is between 0.2 and 0.4 ppm, and that adaptation to this effect of ozone develops with repeated exposures. The threshold concentration of ozone identified in other studies as causing changes in symptoms, lung volumes, or airway resistance was also between 0.2 and 0.4 ppm, and the time course of the development of tolerance to ozone in these other studies was similar to hat observed in our study. We propose that the appearance of symptoms, changes in pulmonary function, and the increase in bronchial reactivity may be caused by a change in the activity of afferent nerve endings in the airway epithelium."

These changes have been reported for the ""initial"" (1- to 3-h) and ""late"" (18- to 20-h) postexposure periods. We hypothesized that at the late period, when protein and cellular markers of inflammation at the airway surface remain abnormal and the integrity of the epithelial barrier is compromised, bronchial reactivity would be increased. To test this, we measured airway responsiveness to cumulative doses of methacholine (MCh) aerosol in healthy subjects 19+/-1 h after a single exposure to O(3) (130 min at ambient levels between 120 and 240 parts/billion and alternate periods of rest and moderate exercise) or filtered air. Exposures were conducted at two temperatures: mild (22 degrees C) and moderate (30 degrees C). At the late period, bronchial reactivity to MCh increased, i.e., interpolated dose of MCh leading to a 50% fall in specific airway conductance (PC(50)) was less after O(3) than after filtered air. PC(50) for O(3) at 22 degrees C was 27 mg/ml (20% less than the PC(50) after filtered air), and for O(3) at 30 degrees C it was 19 mg/ml (70% less than the PC(50) after filtered air). The forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV(1)) at the late time point after O(3) was slightly but significantly reduced (2.3%) from the preexposure level. There was no relationship found between the functional changes observed early after exposure to O(3) and subsequent changes in bronchial reactivity or FEV(1) at the late time point. These results suggest that bronchial reactivity is significantly altered approximately 1 day after O(3); this injury may contribute to the respiratory morbidity that is observed 1-2 days after an episode of ambient air pollution."

On each occasion, we also determined the number of neutrophils in biopsies of the airway epithelium. When the dogs were not treated with indomethacin, ozone caused a marked increase in responsiveness to acetylcholine and a marked increase in the number of neutrophils in the airway epithelium. When the dogs were given indomethacin, responsiveness was no different during treatment than before treatment, but more importantly, responsiveness did not increase significantly after they were exposed to ozone. Interestingly, indomethacin treatment did not affect either the baseline number of epithelial neutrophils before ozone exposure or the increase in the number of neutrophils after exposure.

We conclude that exposure to 0.2 ppm O3 for 7 h affects tracheal epithelial function in rabbits and increases central airway reactivity via vagal mechanisms without altering baseline RL, RC, or RP."

Guinea pigs were pretreated with capsaicin to deplete C-fibers or with vehicle. One week later their isolated, buffer-perfused lungs were exposed to 0.8 ppm ozone or air for 2 hr. In some lungs (9 or 10 each group), increasing doses of methacholine followed by capsaicin were injected into the pulmonary artery. In separate lungs (n = 5, each group), lung Substance P content by EIA and NK1 receptor characteristics by radioligand binding were measured. Analyses were performed by two-way ANOVA with a significant interaction indicative of C-fibers playing a role in ozone responses. Ozone increased R(L) and decreased C(dyn), effects which were apparently not dependent on C-fibers. Ozone increased responsiveness to methacholine, an effect which was reduced by depletion of C-fibers. Ozone increased and C-fiber depletion decreased lung responses to capsaicin. C-fiber depletion but not ozone decreased lung substance P content. C-fiber depletion increased the affinity but did not change the number of NK1 receptors, while ozone had no effect. We conclude that the ozone, in the absence of systemic effects and the blood components of inflammation, increased muscarinic reactivity in part via the local effects of C-fibers."

Unexpectedly, CAP pretreatment caused divergent results in the functional responses to O3. Ventilatory measurements obtained from CAP-pretreated O3-exposed (CAP-O3) animals were exacerbated rather than diminished compared with the effects of O3 alone. Similarly, lavage fluid protein accumulation was enhanced in the CAP-O3 group compared with the O3-exposed group. In better agreement with our initial hypothesis, the CAP-O3 group was less responsive than the O3-exposed animals to histamine aerosol challenge. Additionally, Evans blue dye accumulation, a hallmark of tachykinin release, was increased in O3-exposed animals and was partially blocked in the CAP-O3 group. These data suggest that tachykinin-containing sensory fibers are unlikely to mediate the acute effects of O3 exposure on tidal breathing and lavage fluid protein accumulation but may play a role in causing post-O3 airway hyperreactivity and protein extravasation into the trachea."

Airway responsiveness was assessed with dose-response curves of acetylcholine aerosol versus pulmonary resistance in two sets of experiments. In one set (placebo treatment), five dogs were given only saline solution treatment and were studied before treatment or ozone exposure and then after treatment both before and after ozone (3.0 ppm, 2 hours); in another set (BW755C treatment), the same dogs were studied before BW755C treatment or ozone and then after treatment (10 mg/kg intravenously) both before and after ozone. When the dogs were given no BW755C treatment, ozone induced a marked increase in airway responsiveness to acetylcholine. When the dogs were given BW755C, responsiveness was no different during treatment than before treatment but, more importantly, responsiveness did not increase significantly after ozone.

Airway responsiveness and inflammation were assessed in anesthetized dogs before ozone exposure and then 1 h and 1 wk after ozone (2.1 ppm, 2 h). Airway responsiveness increased markedly at 1 h after ozone and returned to control levels 1 wk later in each of 6 dogs, but it did not change after ozone in another 4 dogs. Furthermore, dogs that became hyperresponsive also developed a marked and reversible increase in the number of neutrophils in the epithelium, whereas dogs that did not become hyperresponsive had no change in the number of neutrophils. For the group of dogs, the level of airway responsiveness before and after ozone exposure correlated closely with the number of epithelial neutrophils. The results suggest that ozone-induced airway hyperresponsiveness may depend on the development of an acute inflammatory response in the airways."

Three hours after cessation of O3, airway responses to inhaled methacholine were determined by whole body plethysmography using changes in enhanced pause (Penh) as an index of airway narrowing. In wild-type mice, O3 exposure (0.5 ppm, 3 h) caused a significant increase in airway responsiveness as indicated by a 1.2 log leftward shift in the methacholine dose- response curve. In contrast, in p55/p75 TNFR / mice, O3 caused only a 0.5 log shift in the dose-response curve (p < 0.05 compared with wild-type). Similar results were obtained in p75 TNFR / mice. In contrast, O3-induced airway hyperresponsiveness was not different in WT and p55 TNFR / mice. During O3 exposure (1 pm, 3 h), minute ventilation ( E) decreased by 64 ? 4% in wild-type, but only 24 ? 5% in p55/p75 TNFR / mice, indicating that despite their reduced O3-induced AHR, the TNFR-deficient mice actually inhaled a greater dose of O3. Similar results were obtained in p75 / mice, whereas changes in E induced by O3 were the same in wild-type and p55 / mice. PMN numbers in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid recovered 21 h after cessation of exposure to O3 (2 ppm, 3 h) were significantly increased compared with after air exposure but were not different in wild-type and p55/p75 TNFR / mice.

IL-1beta expression, assessed by gene microarray, was increased 2-fold 4 h after O(3) exposure, and returned to baseline levels by 24 h. Levels of IL-1beta in lung homogenates were also increased 8 h after O(3) exposure.

Increases in chemokine levels in lung homogenates, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, MIP-2, and keratinocyte chemoattractant following O(3) exposure were prevented by IL-1Ra. Inhalation of dexamethasone, an inhibitor of IL-1 production, blocked the development of AHR, BAL fluid neutrophilia, and decreased levels of IL-1 following O(3) exposure.

Ozone caused a time-dependent increase of bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) neutrophils and macrophages in wild-type mice, maximal at 20?24 h, which was attenuated in the IL-13-/- and IL-4/13-/- mice. In IL-13Tg mice, there was a greater increase in BAL neutrophils after ozone exposure compared with IL-13Wt mice. Using quantitative real-time PCR, ozone-induced mRNA expression for IL-6 and keratinocyte chemokine was further enhanced in IL-13-/- and IL-4/13-/- mice, and was inhibited in IL-13Tg mice. Macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)-3/CCL20 expression was enhanced after ozone exposure in wild-type mice, inhibited in IL-13-/- and IL-4/13-/- mice, while in IL-13Tg mice it was enhanced. A similar pattern of expression was observed with lipopolysaccharide-induced cytokine (LIX/CXCL5/ENA-78) expression.

Because eosinophil populations in the lungs fluctuate following ozone, the contribution of eosinophils to M2 dysfunction and airway hyperreactivity was measured over several days. After one exposure to ozone, M2 function, vagal reactivity, smooth muscle responsiveness, and inflammation were measured in anesthetized guinea pigs. Ozone-induced hyperreactivity to vagal stimulation persisted over 3 days. Although hyperreactivity one day after ozone is mediated by eosinophils, AbVLA-4 did not inhibit either eosinophil accumulation in the lungs or around the nerves or prevent hyperreactivity at this time point. Two days after ozone, eosinophils in BAL, around airway nerves and in lungs, were decreased, and neuronal M2 receptor function was normal, although animals were still hyperreactive to vagal stimulation. Depleting eosinophils with AbIL-5 prevented hyperreactivity, thus eosinophils contribute to vagal hyperreactivity by mechanisms separate from M2 receptor blockade. Three days after ozone, vagal hyperreactivity persisted, eosinophils were again elevated in BAL in lungs and around nerves, and M2 receptors were again dysfunctional. At this point, airway smooth muscle was also hyperresponsive to methacholine. Eosinophil depletion with AbIL-5, AbVLA-4, or cyclophosphamide protected M2 function 3 days after ozone and prevented smooth muscle hyperreactivity. However, vagal hyperreactivity was significantly potentiated by eosinophil depletion. The site of hyperreactivity, muscle or nerve, changes over 3 days after a single exposure to ozone. Additionally, the role of eosinophils is complex; they mediate hyperreactivity acutely while chronically may be involved in repair."

OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to determine whether the GSTM1 null genotype modulates ozone responses in human subjects. METHODS: Thirty-five healthy volunteers were genotyped for the GSTM1 null mutation and underwent a standard ozone exposure protocol to determine whether lung function and inflammatory responses to ozone were different between the 19 GSTM1 wild type and 16 GSTM1 null volunteers. RESULTS: GSTM1 did not modulate lung function responses to acute ozone. Granulocyte influx 4 hours after challenge was similar between GSTM1 normal and null volunteers. However, GSTM1 null volunteers had significantly increased airway neutrophils 24 hours after challenge, as well as increased expression of HLA-DR on airway macrophages and dendritic cells. CONCLUSION: The GSTM1 null genotype is associated with increased airways inflammation 24 hours after ozone exposure, which is consistent with the lag time observed between increased ambient air ozone exposure and exacerbations of lung disease."

Although ozone-induced asthma is characterized by airway neutrophilia, and not eosinophilia, it is nevertheless associated with airway hyperreactivity (AHR), which is a cardinal feature of asthma. Because AHR induced by allergens requires the presence of natural killer T (NKT) cells, we asked whether ozone-induced AHR had similar requirements. We found that repeated exposure of wild-type (WT) mice to ozone induced severe AHR associated with an increase in airway NKT cells, neutrophils, and macrophages. Surprisingly, NKT cell-deficient (CD1d(-/-) and Jalpha18(-/-)) mice failed to develop ozone-induced AHR. Further, treatment of WT mice with an anti-CD1d mAb blocked NKT cell activation and prevented ozone-induced AHR. Moreover, ozone-induced, but not allergen-induced, AHR was associated with NKT cells producing interleukin (IL)-17, and failed to occur in IL-17(-/-) mice nor in WT mice treated with anti-IL-17 mAb. Thus, ozone exposure induces AHR that requires the presence of NKT cells and IL-17 production. Because NKT cells are required for the development of two very disparate forms of AHR (ozone- and allergen-induced), our results strongly suggest that NKT cells mediate a unifying pathogenic mechanism for several distinct forms of asthma, and represent a unique target for effective asthma therapy."

More recently, a more nuanced view of NK cells has emerged. NK cells are now recognized to express a repertoire of activating and inhibitory receptors that is calibrated to ensure self-tolerance while allowing efficacy against assaults such as viral infection and tumor development. Moreover, NK cells do not react in an invariant manner but rather adapt to their environment. Finally, recent studies have unveiled that NK cells can also mount a form of antigen-specific immunologic memory. NK cells thus exert sophisticated biological functions that are attributes of both innate and adaptive immunity, blurring the functional borders between these two arms of the immune response."

Pre-exposure to ozone resulted in enhanced airway hyperreactivity, higher concentrations of both total protein and proinflammatory cytokines in lung lavage fluid, enhanced LPS-mediated signaling in lung tissue, and higher concentrations of serum IL-6 following inhalation of LPS. However, pre-exposure to ozone dramatically reduced inflammatory cell accumulation to the lower airways in response to inhaled LPS. The reduced concentration of cells in the lower airways was associated with enhanced apoptosis of both lung macrophages and systemic circulating monocytes. Moreover, both flow cytometry and confocal microscopy indicate that inhaled ozone causes altered distribution of TLR4 on alveolar macrophages and enhanced functional response to endotoxin by macrophages. These observations indicate that ozone exposure increases both the pulmonary and the systemic biologic response to inhaled LPS by priming the innate immune system."

This leads to activation of intracellular NF-?B signaling and proinflammatory cytokine production. Based on previous information that ozone exposure causes increased HA in bronchial alveolar lavage fluid and ozone pre-exposure primes immune response to inhaled LPS, we hypothesized that HA production during ozone exposure augments the inflammatory response to LPS. We demonstrate that acute ozone exposure at 1 part per million for 3 h primes the immune response to low-dose aerosolized LPS in C57BL/6J mice, resulting in increased neutrophil recruitment into the airspaces, increased levels of protein and proinflammatory cytokines in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, and increased airway hyperresponsiveness. Intratracheal instillation of endotoxin-free HA (25 ?g) enhances the biological response to inhaled LPS in a manner similar to ozone pre-exposure. In vitro studies using bone marrow-derived macrophages indicate that HA enhances LPS responses measured by TNF-? production, while immunofluorescence staining of murine alveolar macrophages demonstrates that HA induces TLR4 peripheralization and lipid raft colocalization. Collectively, our observations support that ozone primes macrophage responsiveness to low-dose LPS, in part, due to HA-induced TLR4 peripheralization in lung macrophages."

It was previously shown that O3 exposure (0.6 ppm, 10 h/day for 15 days) not only results in local bronchial inflammation, but also affects the nervous system and thymocyte proliferation, and places mice under oxidative stress. In the present study, data showed that O3 exposure could impair both the natural killer (NK) cell activity and the proliferation potential of spleen T cells to a specific antigen stimulus. Immunological function assays indicated that O3 exposure attenuated the proliferation of spleen mononuclear cells induced by concanavalin A and decreased CD4+ and CD28+ lymphocyte subsets. However, supplementation with natural antioxidants protected mice from O3-induced dysfunction of splenocyte proliferation. Meanwhile, O3 exposure resulted in a decline of mitogen-induced IL-2 production in splenocytes. It was also found that O3 exposure dramatically enhanced the proliferation of CD4-CD8- thymocytes stimulated by recombinant mouse interleukin-7 (rmIL-7), which is usually observed during the mammal aging process. Taken together, data conclude that short-term repetitive O3 exposure damages both innate and acquired immunity via altering the lymphocyte subset and cytokine profile, and via impact on thymocyte early development. O3-induced oxidative damage is one of the key factors leading to immune dysfunction in this mouse model."

Ozone is a major component of air pollution. Exposure to this powerful oxidizing agent can cause or exacerbate many lung conditions, especially those involving innate immunity. Surfactant protein-A (SP-A) plays many roles in innate immunity by participating directly in host defense as it exerts opsonin function, or indirectly via its ability to regulate alveolar macrophages and other innate immune cells. The mechanism(s) responsible for ozone-induced pathophysiology, while likely related to oxidative stress, are not well understood.

Methods

We employed 2-dimensional difference gel electrophoresis (2D-DIGE), a discovery proteomics approach, coupled with MALDI-ToF/ToF to compare the bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) proteomes in wild type (WT) and SP-A knockout (KO) mice and to assess the impact of ozone or filtered air on the expression of BAL proteins. Using the PANTHER database and the published literature most identified proteins were placed into three functional groups.

Results

We identified 66 proteins and focused our analysis on these proteins. Many of them fell into three categories: defense and immunity; redox regulation; and protein metabolism, modification and chaperones. In response to the oxidative stress of acute ozone exposure (2 ppm; 3 hours) there were many significant changes in levels of expression of proteins in these groups. Most of the proteins in the redox group were decreased, the proteins involved in protein metabolism increased, and roughly equal numbers of increases and decreases were seen in the defense and immunity group. Responses between WT and KO mice were similar in many respects. However, the percent change was consistently greater in the KO mice and there were more changes that achieved statistical significance in the KO mice, with levels of expression in filtered air-exposed KO mice being closer to ozone-exposed WT mice than to filtered air-exposed WT mice.

Conclusion

We postulate that SP-A plays a role in reactive oxidant scavenging in WT mice and that its absence in the KO mice in the presence or absence of ozone exposure results in more pronounced, and presumably chronic, oxidative stress.

SP-A1 and SP-A2 encode human (h) SP-A; SP-A2 products enhance phagocytosis more than SP-A1. Oxidation can affect SP-A function. We hypothesized that in vivo and in vitro ozone-induced oxidation of SP-A (as assessed by its carbonylation level) negatively affects its function in phagocytosis (as assessed by bacteria cell association). To test this, we used P. aeruginosa, rat alveolar macrophages (AMs), hSP-As with varying levels of in vivo (natural) oxidation, and ozone-exposed SP-A2 (1A, 1A0) and SP-A1 (6A2, 6A4) variants. SP-A oxidation levels (carbonylation) were measured; AMs were incubated with bacteria in the presence of SP-A, and the phagocytic index was calculated. We found: 1) the phagocytic activity of hSP-A is reduced with increasing levels of in vivo SP-A carbonylation; 2) in vitro ozone exposure of hSP-A decreases its function in a dose-dependent manner as well as its ability to enhance phagocytosis of either gram-negative or gram-positive bacteria; 3) the activity of both SP-A1 and SP-A2 decreases in response to in vitro ozone exposure of proteins with SP-A2 being affected more than SP-A1. We conclude that both in vivo and in vitro oxidative modifications of SP-A by carbonylation reduce its ability to enhance phagocytosis of bacteria and that the activity of SP-A2 is affected more by in vitro ozone-induced oxidation. We speculate that functional differences between SP-A1 and SP-A2 exist in vivo and that the redox status of the lung microenvironment differentially affects function of SP-A1 and SP-A2."

Surfactant protein A (SP-A) enhances phagocytosis of bacteria, including Klebsiella pneumoniae, by alveolar macrophages. Ozone, a major air pollutant, can cause oxidation of surfactant and may influence lung immune function. Immune function may also be affected by sex-specific mechanisms. We hypothesized that ablation of SP-A has a negative impact on the susceptibility of mice to Klebsiella pneumoniae infection after ozone exposure, and that sex differences in the effect of ozone do exist.

Methods
Male and female SP-A (-/-) mice on the C57BL/6J background were exposed to ozone or to filtered air (FA) used as a control and then infected intratracheally with K. pneumoniae bacteria. Survival rate was monitored during a 14-day period. In addition, protein oxidation levels and in vivo phagocytosis were checked 1 h after inoculation of PBS used as a sham control and after inoculation of K. pneumoniae bacteria in PBS, respectively.

Results
We found: 1) ozone exposure followed by K. pneumoniae infection decreases survival and alveolar macrophage phagocytic function of SP-A (-/-) mice compared to filtered air exposure (p < 0.05), and females are more affected than males; 2) SP-A (-/-) mice (exposed either to ozone or FA) are more susceptible to infection with K. pneumoniae than wild type (WT) mice regarding their survival rate and macrophage phagocytic function; the phagocytic function of FA SP-A(-/-) is similar to that of ozone exposed WT. 3) ozone exposure appears to increase infiltration of PMNs, total protein, and SP-A oxidation in WT mice; infiltration of PMNs and total protein oxidation appears to be more pronounced in female mice in response to ozone; 4) ozone exposure increases SP-A oxidation in WT females significantly more than in males.

Conclusion
Absence (i.e. ablation of SP-A in SP-A (-/-) mice) or reduction of functional activity of SP-A (i.e. oxidation of SP-A in WT mice) increases the susceptibility of mice to experimental pneumonia after ozone exposure, and in both cases females are more affected by ozone exposure than males.

We hypothesized that ambient ozone exposure during postnatal development can affect the innate immune response to other environmental challenges in a persistent fashion. To test this hypothesis, we exposed infant rhesus macaque monkeys to a regimen of 11 ozone cycles between 30 days and 6 mo of age; each cycle consisted of ozone for 5 days (0.5 parts per million at 8 h/day) followed by 9 days of filtered air. Animals were subsequently housed in filtered air conditions and challenged with a single dose of inhaled LPS at 1 yr of age. After completion of the ozone exposure regimen at 6 mo of age, total peripheral blood leukocyte and polymorphonuclear leukocyte (PMN) numbers were reduced, whereas eosinophil counts increased. In lavage, total cell numbers at 6 mo were not affected by ozone, however, there was a significant reduction in lymphocytes and increased eosinophils. Following an additional 6 mo of filtered air housing, only monocytes were increased in blood and lavage in previously exposed animals. In response to LPS challenge, animals with a prior history of ozone showed an attenuated peripheral blood and lavage PMN response compared with controls. In vitro stimulation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells with LPS resulted in reduced secretion of IL-6 and IL-8 protein in association with prior ozone exposure. Collectively, our findings suggest that ozone exposure during infancy can result in a persistent effect on both pulmonary and systemic innate immune responses later in life."

The present study was designed to determine the temporal relationships of ozone-induced inflammatory and epithelial responses and their correlation with subsequent MCM in the NTE of rats. Male F344/N rats were exposed to 0.5 ppm ozone, 8 h/day for 1, 2, or 3 days. Two h prior to sacrifice, all the rats were injected intraperitoneally with 5'-bromo-2-deoxyuridine (BrdU) to label epithelial cells undergoing DNA synthesis. Rats exposed to ozone for 1 or 2 days were killed 2 h after the exposure. Rats exposed to ozone for 3 days were killed 2 h or 1, 2, or 4 days after the exposure. Control rats were killed after a 7-day exposure to filtered air. One nasal passage from the anterior nasal cavity of each rat was fixed and processed for light microscopy to morphometrically determine the numeric densities of epithelial cells, neutrophils, and mucous cells, and the amount of intraepithelial mucosubstances in the NTE. The maxilloturbinate from the other nasal passage was processed for analysis of an airway mucin-specific gene (i.e., rMuc-5AC mRNA). Acute ozone exposure induced a rapid increase in rMuc-5AC mRNA levels prior to the onset of MCM, and the increased levels of rMuc-5AC mRNA persisted with MCM. Neutrophilic inflammation coincided with epithelial DNA synthesis and upregulation of rMuc-5AC, but was resolved when MCM first appeared in the NTE. The results of the present study suggest that upregulation of mucin mRNA by acute ozone exposure may be associated with the concurrent neutrophilic inflammation and epithelial hyperplasia in the NTE. Ozone-induced MCM may be dependent on these important pre-metaplastic responses (i.e., mucin mRNA upregulation, neutrophilic inflammation, and epithelial proliferation)."

To define patterns of acute epithelial injury along intrapulmonary airways, we developed a new analytic approach incorporating labeling of permeable cells, airway microdissection, and laser scanning confocal microscopy, and applied it to isolated perfused rat lungs where ventilation and breathing pattern could be controlled. After exposure to O3 (0, 0.25, 0.5, or 1.0 ppm), lungs were lavaged to assess lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and protein, or infused with the permeability marker ethidium homodimer- 1 (EffiD- 1) via tracheal cannula, gently lavaged, and fixed by airway infusion. The airway tree of the right middle lobe was exposed by microdissection of the axial pathwaf down to the terminal bronchioles; the dissection was incubated with a second nuclear dye, YOPRO- 1, to label all nuclei; and whole mounts were examined by confocal microscopy. Abundance of EthD-l-positive (injured) cells was estimated as the number per epithelial volume using stereology on Z-series of projected images. For ozone concentrations of 1.0 ppm, lavage fluid LDH and total protein did not increase over controls. Exposure produced a concentration-dependent but nonhomogeneous increase in the abundance of EthD-l-labeled cells in proximal and distal conducting airways both in the main pathway, including terminal bronchioles, and in side branches. Overall, the highest EthD-1 labeling occurred in the side branches of the most proximal part of the airway tree at 1 ppm with the adjacent axial pathway airway having approximately one-third the labeling density. Density of EthD-l-labeled cells was lowest in terminal bronchioles at all O3 doses. For the model we used, identification of injured epithelial cells by differential permeability and laser confocal microscopy appeared to be highly sensitive and permitted mapping of acute cytotoxicity throughout the airway tree and quantitative comparisons of sites with different branching histories and potential dosimetry rates."

We have recently reported that long-term inhalation exposure to ozone causes mucous-cell metaplasia (MCM) in the surface epithelium lining the nasal airways of F344 rats. The principal objective of the present study was to determine the persistence of ozone-induced MCM in the nasal epithelium after the end of a chronic exposure. Male F344/N rats were exposed to 0, 0.25, or 0.5 ppm ozone, for 8 h/d, 7 d/wk for 13 wk. Animals were killed 8 h, 4 wk, or 13 wk after the end of the chronic exposure. Ozone-related alterations in the nasal epithelium were qualitatively and quantitatively characterized through histochemistry, image analysis, and morphometric techniques. Some rats were exposed for an additional 8 h to 0.5 ppm ozone at 13 wk after the end of the chronic exposure to determine whether previous ozone exposure results in persistent changes in the sensitivity of nasal epithelium to acute injury. At the end of the chronic exposure, hyperplasia was present in the nasal epithelium of rats exposed to 0.25 and 0.5 ppm ozone. By 13 wk postexposure, this proliferative alteration was still evident only in the rats exposed to 0.5 ppm ozone. Ozone-induced MCM with associated intraepithelial mucosubstances was evident only in the nasal tissues of rats exposed to 0.5 ppm ozone. Though attenuated, these alterations in the nasal mucous apparatus were still detectable at 13 wk after the end of the exposure. At this same time after the chronic exposure, an acute (8 h) exposure to 0.5 ppm ozone induced an additional increase of mucosubstances in the nasal epithelium of rats previously exposed to 0.5 ppm ozone, but not in rats chronically exposed to 0 or 2.5 ppm ozone. The persistent nature of the ozone-induced MCM in rats documented in this report suggests that ozone exposure may have the potential to induce similar long-lasting alterations in the airways of humans."

The rats were exposed to either air or 0.8 ppm O3 for 3 or 7 days, or to 0.8 ppm O3 for 3 days followed by a 4-day exposure to air. The effects of the exposures were determined by quantitating the hyperplastic (epithelial nuclei/mm basal lamina) and secretory metaplastic changes (volume densities of acidic and neutral mucosubstances) within the nasal nonciliated cuboidal epithelium (NNCE). There were no significant changes in NNCE cell numeric density, or in the volume density of intraepithelial mucus, compared to air-exposed control rats, in rats exposed to O3 for 3 days and sacrificed 18 h later.

There were no significant differences in NNCE cell hyperplasia or secretory metaplasia between these two experimental groups. Three 6 h/day exposures to 0.8 ppm O3 triggered hyperplastic and metaplastic changes within rat NNCE that were indistinguishable from those produced by seven 6 h/day exposures to the same concentration of O3. The data suggest that O3 is capable of rapidly inducing hyperplastic and metaplastic responses within rat NNCE, and that once initiated, development of the phenotypic changes within the epithelium does not require further O3 exposure."

Bonnet monkeys were exposed to filtered air or to 0.15 or 0.30 ppm ozone 8 hours/day for 6 or 90 days. At the end of exposures, monkeys were anesthetized and killed by exsanguination. Microdissected bronchiolar airways of infusion-fixed lungs were evaluated morphometrically by light microscopy and quantitatively by scanning and transmission electron microscopy for ozone-induced epithelial changes. Hyperplasia of nonciliated, cuboidal epithelial cells and intraluminal accumulation of macrophages characterized ozone-induced lesions in respiratory bronchioles. There were no significant differences in epithelial thickness or cell numbers among ozone-exposed groups. Ozone-exposed epithelium was composed of 80% cuboidal and 20% squamous cells compared with 40% cuboidal and 60% squamous cells in filtered air controls. In addition, the arithmetic mean thickness of the surface epithelium, a measure of tissue mass per unit area of basal lamina, was significantly increased in all of the ozone-exposed groups. The number of cuboidal epithelial cells per surface area of basal lamina was increased above control values by 780% after 6 days exposure to 0.15 ppm, 777% after 90 days to 0.15 ppm, and 996% after 90 days exposure to 0.30 ppm. There was also a significant ozone-induced increase in the thickness of the bronchiolar interstitium that was due to an increase in both cellular and acellular components. These results demonstrate that exposure to low ambient concentrations of ozone, near the current. National Ambient Air Quality Standard, induces pulmonary lesions in primates. The alterations do not appear to be concentration- or time-dependent, suggesting that the current National Ambient Air Quality Standard may be at or above the threshold for deep lung injury in primates."

The daily exposure regimen consisted of a 13-hr background of 0.06 ppm, an exposure peak that rose from 0.06 to 0.25 ppm, and returned to the background level over a 9-hr period, and 2-hr downtime for maintenance. Rats were exposed for 1, 3, 13, and 78 weeks. Additional groups of rats exposed for 13 or 78 weeks were allowed to recover in filtered clean air for 6 or 17 weeks, respectively. Rats exposed to filtered air for the same lengths of time were used as controls. Samples from proximal alveolar regions and terminal bronchioles were obtained by microdissection. Analysis of the proximal alveolar region revealed a biphasic response. Acute tissue reactions after 1 week of exposure included epithelial inflammation, interstitial edema, interstitial cell hypertrophy, and influx of macrophages. These responses subsided after 3 weeks of exposure. Progressive epithelial and interstitial tissue responses developed with prolonged exposure and included epithelial hyperplasia, fibroblast proliferation, and interstitial matrix accumulation. The epithelial responses involved both type I and type II epithelial cells. Alveolar type I cells increased in number, became thicker, and covered a smaller average surface area. These changes persisted throughout the entire exposure and did not change during the recovery period, indicating the sensitivity of these cells to injury. The main response of type II epithelial cells was cell proliferation. The accumulation of interstitial matrix after chronic exposure consisted of deposition of both increased amounts of basement membrane and collagen fibers. Interstitial matrix accumulation underwent partial recovery during follow-up periods in air; however, the thickening of the basement membrane did not resolve. Analysis of terminal bronchioles showed that short-term exposure to O3 caused a loss of ciliated cells and differentiation of preciliated and Clara cells. The bronchiolar cell population stabilized on continued exposure; however, chronic exposure resulted in structural changes, suggesting injury to both ciliated and Clara cells. We conclude that chronic exposure to low levels of O3 causes epithelial inflammation and interstitial fibrosis in the proximal alveolar region and bronchiolar epithelial cell injury."

To investigate the molecular mechanism underlying O(3)-induced pulmonary fibrosis, 6- to 8-week-old C57BL/6 male mice were exposed to a cyclic O(3) exposure protocol consisting of 2 days of filtered air and 5 days of O(3) exposure (0.5?ppm, 8?h/day) for 5 and 10 cycles with or without intraperitoneal injection of IN-1233, a specific inhibitor of the type 1 receptor of transforming growth factor beta (TGF-?), the most potent profibrogenic cytokine. The results showed that O(3) exposure for 5 or 10 cycles increased the TGF-? protein level in the epithelial lining fluid (ELF), associated with an increase in the expression of plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 (PAI-1), a TGF-?-responsive gene that plays a critical role in the development of fibrosis under various pathological conditions. Cyclic O(3) exposure also increased the deposition of collagens and alpha smooth muscle actin (?-SMA) in airway walls. However, these fibrotic changes were not overt until after 10 cycles of O(3) exposure. Importantly, blockage of the TGF-? signaling pathway with IN-1233 suppressed O(3)-induced Smad2/3 phosphorylation, PAI-1 expression, as well as collagens and ?-SMA deposition in the lung. Our data demonstrate for the first time that O(3) exposure increases TGF-? expression and activates TGF-? signaling pathways, which mediates O(3)-induced lung fibrotic responses in vivo."

Inhalation of urban particulate matter and ozone by rats has been shown to result in increased synthesis of the potent vasoactive peptide endothelin (ET)-1 in the lungs, with spillover into the circulation. In the present work, we have analyzed the interrelationships between responses of the three major endothelin isoforms, ET-1[1-21], ET-2[1-21], and ET-3[1-21], to inhaled pollutants at the peptide and gene expression levels. Fisher-344 rats were exposed for 4 hrs by nose-only route to clean air, urban particles EHC-93 (0, 50 mg/m3), ozone (0, 0.8 ppm), or ozone and particles together. Circulating levels of both the ET-1 [1-21] and ET-3[1-21] peptides were increased immediately after exposure to particulate matter or ozone. While expression of preproET-1 mRNA in the lungs increased, expression of preproET-3 mRNA decreased immediately after exposure. PreproET-2 mRNA was not detected in the lungs, and exposure to either pollutant did not affect plasma ET-2 levels. Co-exposure to ozone and particles, while altering lung preproET-1 and preproET-3 mRNA levels in a fashion similar to ozone alone, did not cause changes in the circulating levels of the two corresponding peptides. Thus, de novo synthesis of ET-3 in the lungs is not responsible for the increase of circulating plasma ET-3 after inhalation of pollutants, which implies regulation of preproET-3 at a remote site and, hence, systemic impacts of the pollutants. Upregulation of preproET-1 coupled with down-regulation of preproET-3 in the lungs of animals exposed to air pollutants implies a mismatch of local ET-1/ET(A) receptor-mediated vasoconstriction and ET-3/ET(B) receptor-mediated vasodilation."

Fischer-344 rats were exposed to particles (0, 5, 50 mg/m3 EHC-93), ozone (0, 0.4, 0.8 ppm), or combinations of particles and ozone for 4 h. Changes in gene expression were measured using real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction immediately after exposure and following 24 h recovery in clean air. Both pollutants individually increased preproET-1, endothelin converting enzyme-1, and endothelial nitric oxide synthase mRNA levels in the lungs shortly after exposure, consistent with the concomitant increase in plasma of the 21 amino acid ET-1[1-21] peptide measured by HPLC-fluorescence. PreproET-1 mRNA remained elevated 24 h after exposure to particles but not after ozone, in line with previously documented changes of the peptide in plasma. Both pollutants transiently increased endothelin-B receptor mRNA expression, while ozone decreased endothelin-A receptor mRNA levels. Coexposure to particles plus ozone increased lung preproET-1 mRNA but not plasma ET-1[1-21], suggesting alternative processing or degradation of endothelins. This coincided with an increase in the lungs of matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2), an enzyme that cleaves bigET-1 to ET-1[1-32].

Although ozone (O3) is an oxidant pollutant to which many people are exposed, few studies have examined whether O3 induces oxidative stress in humans. OBJECTIVES: This study was designed to assess the effect of short-and long-term O(3) exposures on biomarkers of oxidative stress in healthy individuals. METHODS: Biomarkers of lipid peroxidation, 8-isoprostane (8-iso-PGF), and antioxidant capacity ferric reducing ability of plasma (FRAP) were analyzed in two groups of healthy college students with broad ranges of ambient O3 exposure during their lifetimes and previous summer recess either in Los Angeles (LA, n = 59) or the San Francisco Bay Area (SF, n = 61). RESULTS: Estimated 2-week, 1-month, and lifetime O3 exposures were significantly correlated with elevated 8-iso-PGF. Elevated summertime exposures resulted in the LA group having higher levels of 8-iso-PGF than the SF group (p = 0.02). Within each location, males and females had similar 8-iso-PGF. No regional difference in FRAP was observed, with significantly higher FRAP in males in both groups (SF: p = 0.002; LA: p = 0.004). An exposure chamber substudy (n = 15) also showed a significant increase in 8-iso-PGF as well as an inhibition of FRAP immediately after a 4-hr exposure to 200 ppb O3, with near normalization by 18 hr in both biomarkers. CONCLUSIONS: Long-term exposure to O3 is associated with elevated 8-iso-PGF, which suggests that 8-iso-PGF is a good biomarker of oxidative damage related to air pollution."

One group spent their summer in the Los Angeles (LA) area where summer O(3) concentrations are significantly higher than in the San Francisco Bay (SF) area, and another remained in SF. During the school year, all students were exposed to low O(3) levels in SF. The micronucleus assay in a total of 611,000 buccal cells demonstrated that, in the fall, micronuclei (MN) in normal cells for the LA group had increased 39% relative to levels in the spring (1.52 and 0.87 MN/1,000 cells, respectively, P = 0.001). Students who spent the summer in SF had a 12.7% increase (P = 0.48). A similar effect of season was seen in degenerated buccal cells for the LA group (3.23 versus 1.88 MN/1,000 cells, P = 0.003). LA but not SF subjects also had more degenerated cells in the fall sample (P = 0.003). These findings were paralleled by an increase in MN and nucleoplasmic bridges in lymphocytes and MN in buccal cells in a sub-group of 15 students who underwent a 4-h controlled exposure to 200 p.p.b.

This cytogenetic evidence, along with recent studies linking O(3) exposure to elevated lung cancer risk and mortality, suggest potential public health implications from exposures to high oxidant environments."

Mechanisms of cardiovascular injuries from exposure to gas and particulate air pollutants are unknown. Objective - We hypothesized that episodic exposure of rats to ozone or diesel exhaust particles (DEP) will cause differential cardiovascular impairments, which will be exacerbated by ozone+DEP. Methods and Results ? Male Wistar Kyoto rats (10-12 wk) were exposed to air, ozone (0.4ppm), DEP (2.1mg/m3) or ozone (0.38ppm)+DEP (2.2mg/m3), 5h/d, 1 d/wk for 16 wks, or to air, ozone (0.51 or 1.0ppm), or DEP (1.9mg/m3), 5h/d for 2 days. Pulmonary and cardiovascular biomarkers of injury were examined. Mild pulmonary pathology occurred following 16-wk ozone, DEP and ozone+DEP exposures. In 16-wk study, circulating lymphocytes slightly decreased by ozone and DEP and platelets by DEP. mRNA biomarkers of oxidative stress (HO-1), thrombosis (TF, PAI-1, tPA, and vWf), vasoconstriction (ET-1, ET receptor A and B, eNOS) and proteolysis (MMP-2, MMP-3, and TIMP-2) were increased by DEP and/or ozone in the aorta but not in heart in16-wk study. Aortic LOX-1 mRNA and protein increased by ozone, and protein by ozone+DEP. RAGE mRNA increased by ozone+DEP. Exposure to ozone or DEP depleted cardiac mitochondrial phospholipid fatty acids (DEP>ozone). The effects of ozone+DEP were less pronounced than either pollutant alone. Acute exposure caused mild changes in the aorta. Conclusions ? Sixteen weekly episodic exposures to ozone or DEP alone elevated biomarkers of vascular impairments in the aorta with the loss of phospholipid fatty acids in myocardial mitochondria. A possible role of oxidized lipids and protein through LOX-1 and/or RAGE signaling is postulated."

Out of 350,000 sudden cardiac deaths each year in the United States, 60,000 deaths have been related to air pollution, suggesting a detrimental role of environmental pollutants in the development of CVD. The present study tested our hypothesis that chronic ozone exposure enhances the sensitivity to ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury in isolated perfused hearts. Sprague-Dawley rats were continuously exposed for 8 h/day for 28 and 56 days to filtered air or 0.8 ppm ozone. Isolated hearts were subjected to 30 min of global ischemia followed by 60 min of reperfusion. Cardiac function after I/R measured as left ventricular developed pressure (LVDP), +dP/dt, -dP/dt, and left ventricular end diastolic pressure (LVEDP) was significantly decreased and increased respectively in ozone-exposed I/R hearts compared to I/R hearts exposed to filtered air. The enhanced sensitivity to I/R injury upon ozone exposure was associated with increased myocardial TNF-alpha levels and lipid peroxidation and decreased myocardial activities of superoxidase dismutase (SOD) and IL-10. These data suggest that ozone-induced sensitivity to myocardial I/R injury may be due to promoting levels of oxidative stress as well as inflammatory mediators."

Objective: To assess the impact of ozone and particulate matter exposure on HRV in humans. Methods: Using a cross-over design, 50 subjects (ages 19-48) were randomized to 2-hr controlled
exposures to filtered air (FA), concentrated ambient particles (CAPs), ozone (O3), or combined CAPs and ozone (CAPs+O3). The primary endpoint was change in HRV between the start and
end of exposure. Secondary analyses included blood pressure (BP) responses, and effect modification by asthmatic status. Results: Achieved mean CAPs and ozone exposure concentrations were 121.6 ? 48.0 ?g/m3 and 113.9 ? 6.6 ppb respectively. In a categorical
analysis, exposure had no consistent effect on HRV indices. However, there was a suggestion that the dose-response relationship between CAPs mass concentration and HRV indices varied depending on the presence of ozone. This heterogeneity was statistically significant for the lowfrequency component of HRV (p=0.02) and approached significance for the high frequency component and time-domain measures of HRV. Exposure to CAPs+O3 increased diastolic BP
by 2.0 mmHg (SE: 1.2; p=0.02). No other statistically significant changes in BP were observed. Asthmatic status did not modify these effects. Conclusion: The potentiation by ozone of CAPs effects on diastolic BP and possibly HRV is of small magnitude in young adults.

Relative to FA exposure, O3 exposure induced no statistically significant changes in cardiac index, ventricular performance, pulmonary artery pressure, pulmonary and systemic vascular resistances, ECG, serum cardiac enzymes, plasma catecholamines and atrial natriuretic factor, and SaO2. The overall results did not indicate major acute cardiovascular effects of O3 in either the hypertensive or the control subjects. However, mean preexposure to postexposure changes were significantly (p < 0.02) larger with O3 than with FA for rate-pressure product (1,353 beats/min/mm Hg) and for heart rate (8 beats/min); these responses were not significantly different between the hypertensive and the control subjects. Significant O3 effects were also observed for mean FEV1 (-6%), and AaPO2 (> 10 mm Hg increase), which were not significantly different between the two groups.

The sputum cellular responses to ozone were not significantly altered by ASA treatment. In nasal lavage, cell counts and differentials did not change significantly after exposure to ozone in comparison to filtered air control. The cellular data indicate an acute inflammation developed during ozone exposure in the lower respiratory tract. The concentrations of total protein and interleukin-8 and the activity of N-acetyl-@bgr;-D-glucosaminidase (a lysosomal enzyme) in nasal lavage and sputum did not change significantly following exposure to ozone in comparison to filtered air control. Plasma 2,3-DHBA concentration increased significantly following exposure to 0.12 ppm ozone in an exposure-dependent temporal pattern. Salicylate metabolites in nasal lavage fluid and sputum did not increase significantly following exposure to ozone. There was a marked variation of 2,3-DHBA concentrations in airway fluids.

Results showed that ozone exposure for 30 or 60 days impaired formation/retention of a selective olfactory recognition memory 120 min after exposure to a juvenile stimulus animal with the effect at 60 days being significantly greater than at 30 days. They also showed impaired speed in locating a buried chocolate reward after 60 days of ozone exposure indicating some loss of olfactory perception. These functional impairments could all be prevented by coincident estradiol treatment. In the olfactory bulb, levels of lipid peroxidation were increased at both 30- and 60-day time-points and numbers of cells with immunohistochemical staining for alpha and beta estrogen receptors, and dopamine beta-hydroxylase were reduced as were alpha and beta estrogen receptor protein levels. These effects were prevented by estradiol treatment. Oxidative stress damage caused by chronic exposure to ozone does therefore impair olfactory perception and social recognition memory and may do so by reducing noradrenergic and estrogen receptor activity in the olfactory bulb. That these effects can be prevented by estradiol treatment suggests increased susceptibility to neurodegenerative disorders in aging women may be contributed to by reduced estrogen levels post-menopause."

This study focused on the neural mechanisms underlying the adaptive responses to an acute ozone exposure. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is a factor associated with cellular recovery following brain injury. The aim of this study was to assess and localize the cellular expression of VEGF, since the central respiratory areas show a neuroplasticity in response to ozone. Adult rats were subjected to 0.5ppm ozone for 3h and then recovered for further 3h. The expression of VEGF was evaluated by immunocytochemistry in the central respiratory areas, i.e., the nucleus tractus solitarius (NTS) and the ventrolateral medulla (VLM). The data show a VEGF overexpression at the end of ozone exposure, which persisted during the 3-h recovery. Interestingly, using confocal analysis the bulk of VEGF labeling was observed in astroglial cell bodies and branches, while neuronal labeling was hardly noticed. Moreover, VEGF colocalized with IL-6 and TNFalpha in astrocytes closely apposed to blood vessel walls. The vasculature area was markedly increased (+58%) during post-ozone recovery. The data show that an acute ozone exposure affects primarily glial cells in the central nervous system. The VEGF up-regulation which persists after ozone exposure may contribute to brain repair and consecutive functional adaptations."

Results indicate that ozone exposure causes a significant decrease in motor activity. Ozone produced lipid peroxidation, morphological alterations, loss of fibers and cell death of the dopaminergic neurons. The DARPP-32, iNOS and SOD expression increased with repetitive ozone exposure. These alterations suggest that ozone causes oxidative stress which induces oxidative damage to substantia nigra and striatum of the rat."

We have also studied the correlation between the increases in oxidized dopamine-species levels with the severity of lipid-peroxidation in the plasma. Sixty-four male Wistar rats were divided into four experimental groups and received air (Group I, control) or ozone (0.25 ppm) daily by inhalation for 4h for 15 (Group II), 30 (Group III), and 60 (Group IV) days. The brains were processed for immunohistochemical location of dopamine and p53 in the substantia nigra. Plasma collected from these animals was assayed for oxidized dopamine products using CV and lipid-peroxidation levels were measured. Our results indicate that chronic exposure to low O(3) doses causes that the number of dopaminergic neurons decreased, and p53-immunoreactive cells increases until 30 days; which was a function of the time of exposure to ozone. Oxidative stress produces a significant increase in the levels of the dopamine quinones (DAQs) that correlated well (r=0.962) with lipid peroxides in the plasma during the study period. These results suggest that DAQ could be a reliable, peripheral oxidative indicator of nigral dopaminergic damage in the brain."

The site of ROS-mediated inhibition of steroidogenesis in the corpus luteum and MA-10 tumor Leydig cells was shown to be the hormone-sensitive mitochondrial cholesterol transfer step. The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of ROS on steroidogenic acute regulatory (StAR) protein in MA-10 cells and determine the extent to which MA-10 cell mitochondria are sensitive to oxidative stress. cAMP-stimulated progesterone production was inhibited in a dose-dependent manner in MA-10 cells exposed to H(2)O(2). StAR protein, but not mRNA levels, was decreased in parallel to changes in progesterone production. Even at the highest concentrations of H(2)O(2) tested, there was no effect on P450 side-chain cleavage enzyme protein levels. Oxidative stress from exposure to exogenous xanthine oxidase and xanthine resulted in the inhibition of both progesterone production and StAR protein expression. The mature 30- and 32-kDa intramitochondrial forms of StAR were decreased relative to the 37-kDa extramitochondrial precursor form of StAR, indicating that the ROS-mediated inhibition of StAR protein was due, in part, to the inhibition of mitochondrial import and processing. Vital staining with the fluorescent dye tetramethylrhodamine ethyl ester was used to visualize changes in the mitochondrial electrochemical gradient-dependent membrane potential (Deltapsim). ROS caused a significant dissipation of Deltapsi(m) and time-dependent loss of tetramethylrhodamine ethyl ester fluorescence. The inhibitory effects of H(2)O(2) were transient. There was no evidence for ROS-induced cell death, and following H(2)O(2) removal in the presence of continuous treatment with 8-bromo-cAMP, StAR protein levels and progesterone production were restored. In addition, there was no loss of cell viability following treatment with H(2)O(2) or xanthine/xanthine oxidase as determined by trypan blue exclusion. H(2)O(2) did not cause a significant decrease in total cellular ATP levels. These data indicate that oxidative stress-mediated perturbation of the mitochondria and dissipation of Deltapsi(m) results in the inhibition of StAR protein expression and its import, processing, and cholesterol transfer activity. These findings confirm earlier studies demonstrating the requirement for maintenance of an intact Deltapsi(m) for StAR protein function in cholesterol transport. The significant reduction in the 32- to 30-kDa mature forms of StAR, cessation of cholesterol transport, and loss of Deltapsi(m) are consistent with mitochondrial perturbation because of oxidative stress. This mechanism likely contributes to a host of pathophysiological events evident in testicular disorders such as infection, reperfusion injury, aging, cryptorchidism, and varicocele."

SETTING: Fertility research center and obstetrics and gynecology department in a tertiary care facility.

RESULT(S): ROS plays an essential role in the pathogenesis of many reproductive processes. In male-factor infertility. oxidative stress attacks the fluidity of the sperm plasma membrane and the integrity of DNA in the sperm nucleus. Reactive oxygen species induced DNA damage may accelerate the process of germ cell apoptosis, leading to the decline in sperm counts associated with male infertility. ROS mediated female fertility disorders share many pathogenic similarities with the ones on the male side. These similarities include a potential role in the pathophysiology of endometriosis and unexplained infertility. High follicular fluid ROS levels are associated with negative IVF outcomes, particularly in smokers. Moreover, oxidative stress may be responsible in hydrosalpingeal fluid mediated embryotoxicity as well as poor in vitro embryonic development.

CONCLUSION(S): High levels of ROS are detrimental to the fertility potential both in natural and assisted conception states."

However, changes in gene expression have also been reported in livers of O(3)-exposed mice. The principal aim of the present study was to determine if acute exposure to environmentally relevant concentrations of O(3) could cause exacerbation of drug-induced liver injury in mice. Overdose with acetaminophen (APAP) is the most common cause of drug-induced liver injury in developed countries. In the present study, we examined the hepatic effects of acute O(3) exposure in mice pretreated with a hepatotoxic dose of APAP. C57BL/6 male mice were fasted overnight and then given APAP (300 mg/kg ip) or saline vehicle (0 mg/kg APAP). Two hours (h) later, mice were exposed to 0, 0.25 or 0.5 ppm O(3) for 6 h, and then sacrificed 9 or 32 h after APAP administration (1 or 24 h after O(3) exposure, respectively). Animals euthanized at 32 h were given 5-bromo-2-deoxyuridine (BrdU) 2 h before sacrifice to identify hepatocytes undergoing reparative DNA synthesis. Saline-treated mice exposed to either air or O(3) had no liver injury. All APAP-treated mice developed marked centrilobular hepatocellular necrosis that increased in severity with time after APAP exposure. O(3) exposure increased the severity of APAP-induced liver injury as indicated by an increase in necrotic hepatic tissue and plasma alanine aminotransferase (ALT) activity. O(3) also caused an increase in neutrophil accumulation in livers of APAP-treated animals. APAP induced a 10-fold increase in the number of bromodeoxyuridine-labeled hepatocytes that was markedly attenuated by O(3) exposure. Gene expression analysis 9 h after APAP revealed differential expression of genes involved in inflammation, oxidative stress and cellular regeneration in mice treated with APAP and O(3) compared to APAP or O(3) alone, providing some indications of the mechanisms behind the APAP and O(3) potentiation. These results suggest that acute exposure to near ambient concentrations of this oxidant air pollutant may exacerbate drug-induced liver injury by delaying hepatic repair."

The effects of rabbit exposure to ozone (O3) (0.4 ppm for 4 h) on pulmonary mechanical properties and hemodynamics have been investigated on the isolated perfused lung model. Tracheal pressure, airflow, and tidal volume were measured in order to calculate lung resistance (RD and dynamic compliance (Cdyn). Using the arterial/venous/double occlusion method, the total pressure gradient (APt) was partitioned into four components (arterial, pre-, postcapillary and venous). Dose-response curves to acetylcholine (ACh), substance P (SP), and histamine were constructed in lungs isolated from rabbits immediately or 48 h after air or O3 exposure. O3 induced a significant increase in the baseline value of APt, more markedly 48 h after the exposure. Immediately after the exposure, O3 partly inhibited the ACh-, SP-, and histamine-induced decreases in Cdyn and increases in RL. This inhibitory effect was still in part present 48 h after O3 treatment. In the groups studied immediately after exposure, O3 did not significantly modify the ACh-, SP-, and histamine-induced vasoconstriction. Forty-eight hours after exposure, O3 induced a contractile response to ACh and SP in the arterial segment but decreased the response to histamine. We conclude that O3 can induce direct vascular constriction. Directly, but also 48 h after exposure, O3 can inhibit the ACh-, SP-, and histamine-induced changes in lung mechanical properties. Ozone can also induce some changes in the intensity and in the location of the vascular responses to ACh, SP, and histamine."

Intermittent exercise utilized in all exposures was adjusted to produce an ozone dose of 560 ppm x L/m2 BSA. The post-O3 ""Delta""%FEV1 decrements of young (18-35 yrs) and middle-age (36-60 yrs) males and females differed significantly (p<0.05) from normal distribution with values skewed towards larger decrements in younger subjects.

This pattern was reversed in the middle-age cohort. Our data support earlier reports of no significant difference in spirometric response to O3 between young men and women. The data also confirm that large FEV1 decrements following O3 exposure are mostly confined to younger individuals that also show much greater variance in response to repeated exposures than the middle-age subjects. The majority of subjects remained in their initial category of O3 sensitivity on retesting after various time lapses. The r value (Spearman) between the 1st and 2nd, and 1st and 3rd exposure response ranged from 0.544 to 0.850, depending on classification.

We addressed multiple inflammatory, immunity, and antioxidant genes identified as candidate genetic determinants following these strategies, which include tumor necrosis factor (Tnf), toll-like receptor 4,(Tlr4), and the transcription factor NF-E2, related factor 2 (Nrf2). Mice with targeted deletion of these and related genes have provided initial proof of concept for their importance in the respective models.

Exposures to the common air pollutant ozone (O3) cause decrements in pulmonary function and induce airway inflammation that is characterized by infiltration of polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMNs; refs 1-4). Because of the impact that O3 may have on public health, it is critical to identify susceptibility factors. Highly reproducible, significant inter-individual variations in human pulmonary function responses to O3 support the hypothesis that genetic background is an important determinant. Initial analysis of PMN responses to O3 exposure in segregant populations derived from inflammation-prone (susceptible) C57BLI6J (B6) and inflammation-resistant C3H/HeJ (C3) inbred mice indicated that susceptibility was controlled by a locus we termed Inf2 (ref. 7). Subsequent analyses with recombinant inbred strains suggested that a more complex interaction of genes is involved. In this report, we identify a quantitative trait locus (QTL) for O3 susceptibility on chromosome 17. Candidate genes for the locus include Tnf, the gene encoding the pro-inflammatory cytokine tumour necrosis factor-x (Tnf). Antibody neutralization of the protein product of this putative candidate gene significantly protected against O3 injury in susceptible mice. These results strongly support linkage of O3 susceptibility to a QTL on chromosome 17 and Tnf as a candidate gene."

The aim of this study was to test in inbred strains of mice whether the lung susceptibility to O3 correlates with the transepithelial leakage of CC16, with the mRNA and protein levels of CC16, and possibly with specific isoforms of the protein in the respiratory tract. Five strains of mouse with increasing sensitivity to O3 (C3H, AKR, SJL, CBA, and C57Bl) were exposed to 1.8 ppm O3 for 3 h and examined at 0 and 6 h postexposure. The most sensitive (C57Bl) and resistant (C3H) mice were also continuously exposed to 0.11 ppm O3 for up to 3 days. Lung injury was evaluated by measuring in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) the levels of total protein, albumin, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and inflammatory cells. The patterns of proteins in BALF were also analyzed by two-dimensional electrophoresis (2-DE). Exposure to 1.8 or 0.11 ppm O3 caused a transient elevation of CC16 in serum that was maximal immediately after exposure and closely correlated with the extent of lung injury evaluated by BALF markers. The epithelial damage assessed on the basis of serum CC16 or BALF markers showed an inverse relation with the preexposure levels of CC16 in BALF. Since preexposure levels of CC16 mRNA were similar between the strains and since lung epithelium damage was also negatively correlated with preexposure levels of albumin in BALF, these findings identify basal lung epithelium permeability as a determinant of susceptibility to O3. The 2-DE mapping of proteins in BALF of these two strains revealed the existence of two distinct isoforms of CC16 with pI values of 4.9 and 5.2. The most acidic form was significantly less concentrated in the C57Bl strain, the most sensitive to O3, a difference that might be related to the higher permeability of the lung epithelium or to some post-transcriptional variations. In conclusion, these results suggest that the permeability of the lung epithelial barrier may be an important determinant of the lung susceptibility to O3, controlling the intrapulmonary levels of CC16 and possibly of other antioxidant/inflammatory proteins."

OBJECTIVES: We hypothesized that the functional polymorphisms of HMOX-1 ([GT](n) repeat), CAT (-262C>T -844C>T), and MNSOD (Ala-9Val) are associated with new-onset asthma, and the effects of these variants vary by exposure to ozone, a potent oxidant air pollutant. Methods: We assessed this hypothesis in a population-based cohort of non-Hispanic (n = 1,125) and Hispanic white (n = 586) children who resided in 12 California communities and who were followed annually for 8 years to ascertain new-onset asthma. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Air pollutants were continuously measured in each of the study communities during the 8 years of study follow-up. HMOX-1 ""short"" alleles (<23 repeats) were associated with a reduced risk for new-onset asthma among non-Hispanic whites (hazard ratio [HR], 0.64; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.41-0.99). This protective effect was largest in children residing in low-ozone communities (HR, 0.48; 95% CI, 0.25-0.91) (interaction P value = 0.003). Little evidence for an association with HMOX-1 was observed among Hispanic children. In contrast, Hispanic children with a variant of the CAT-262 ""T"" allele (CT or TT) had an increased risk for asthma (HR, 1.78; P value = 0.01). The effects of these polymorphisms were not modified by personal smoking or secondhand-smoke exposure. CONCLUSIONS: Functional promoter variants in CAT and HMOX-1 showed ethnicity-specific associations with new-onset asthma. Oxidant gene protection was restricted to children living in low-ozone communities."

One TNF promoter variant (G-308A) affects expression of TNF and has been associated with inflammatory diseases; however, studies of asthma have been inconsistent. Because ozone produces oxidative stress, increased airway TNF, and inflammation, the associations of the -308 TNF polymorphism with asthma may vary by ozone exposure and variants of oxidant defense genes glutathione-S-transferase (GST) M1 and GSTP1. OBJECTIVES: To investigate the association of TNF G-308A with asthma and wheezing and to determine whether these associations vary with ozone exposure and GSTM1 and GSTP1 genotype. METHODS: We studied associations of TNF-308 genotype with lifetime and current wheezing and asthma among 3,699 children in the Children's Health Study. We examined differences in associations with community ozone and by GSTM1 null and GSTP1 105 Ile/Val (A105G) genotype. Results: Children with TNF-308 GG had decreased risk of asthma (odds ratio, 0.8; 95% confidence interval, 0.7-0.9) and lifetime wheezing (odds ratio, 0.8; 95% confidence interval, 0.7-0.9). The protective effects of GG genotype on wheezing outcomes were of greater magnitude in lower compared with higher ozone communities. These findings were replicated in the two cohorts of fourth-grade children recruited in 1993 and 1996. The reduction of the protective effect from the -308 GG genotype with higher ozone exposure was most marked in the GSTM1 null and GSTP1 Ile/Ile groups.

NQO1 and GSTM1 polymorphisms were characterized by polymerase chain reaction- based methods. The 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) adduct was also measured in DNA of peripheral leukocytes. Rides at O3 > 80 ppb resulted in significant decrements of pulmonary function tests and increased levels of serum CC16, consistent with mild impairment in respiratory function and increased lung epithelial permeability, respectively. Whereas NQO1wt and GSTM1null subjects showed both functional changes and increased serum CC16 after acute O3 exposure, people with other haplotypes showed a rise in serum CC16 but no changes in lung function tests. In NQO1wt and GSTM1null subjects, partial correlation analysis showed that functional decrements and increased serum CC16 are closely associated with each other and with O3 levels, whereas no such relationships were found among subjects bearing other haplotypes.

The clearest examples of genetic interactions for inhaled pollutants exist for endotoxin, environmental tobacco smoke, and ozone. Endotoxin-genetic interactions in asthma are the focus of two other manuscripts from this conference, so this review focuses on environmental tobacco smoke and ozone. In the sparse literature, there is evidence for the role of specific genes involved in oxidative stress, notably GSTM1 and TNF, in the respiratory responses to ozone and environmental tobacco smoke. There are few data on genes involved in innate immune pathways, which are crucial in response to endotoxin and may play a role in response to ozone and environmental tobacco smoke. Genes involved in oxidative stress may interact with both air pollutants and diet in relation to asthma phenotypes. Future directions to advance the field include whole genome association studies, better assessment of exposure and phenotypes, and consideration of joint interactions with diet and other co-factors that influence individual susceptibility."

Glutathione S-transferases (GSTs) can modulate the intracellular concentrations of HNE by affecting its generation during lipid peroxidation by reducing hydroperoxides and also by converting it into a glutathione conjugate. We have recently demonstrated that overexpression of the Alpha class GSTs in cells leads to lower steady-state levels of HNE, and these cells acquire resistance to apoptosis induced by lipid peroxidation-causing agents such as H2O2, UVA, superoxide anion, and pro-oxidant xenobiotics, suggesting that signaling for apoptosis by these agents is transduced through HNE. Cells with the capacity to exclude HNE from the intracellular environment at a faster rate are relatively more resistant to apoptosis caused by H2O2, UVA, superoxide anion, and pro-oxidant xenobiotics as well as by HNE, suggesting that HNE may be a common denominator in mechanisms of apoptosis caused by oxidative stress. We have also shown that transfection of adherent cells with HNE-metabolizing GSTs leads to transformation of these cells due to depletion of HNE. These recent studies from our laboratories, which strongly suggest that HNE is a key signaling molecule and that GSTs, being determinants of its intracellular concentrations, can regulate stress-mediated signaling, are reviewed in this article."

Objectives: To test whether airway effects occur below the current ozone standard and if they are more pronounced in potentially susceptible individuals, such as those deficient in the antioxidant gene glutathione S-transferase M1. 

Methods: Pulmonary function and subjective symptoms were measured in 59 healthy young adults (19-35 years) immediately before and after exposure to 0.0 (clean air, CA) and 0.06 ppm ozone for 6.6 hours in a chamber while undergoing intermittent moderate exercise. The polymorphonuclear neutrophil (PMN) influx was measured in 24 subjects 16-18 hour post-exposure 

Measurements and Main Results: Subjects experienced a significantly greater (p=0.008) change in FEV1 (?standard error) immediately following exposure to 0.06ppm ozone compared to CA (-1.76?0.50% vs. -0.002?0.46%). The decrement in FVC was also greater (p=0.02) after ozone vs. CA (-2.32?0.41% vs. -1.13?0.34%). Similarly, changes in %PMN were greater after ozone (54.0?4.6%) than CA (38.3?3.7%) exposure (p<0.001). Symptom scores were not different between ozone vs. CA. There were no significant differences in changes in FEV1, FVC and %PMN between subjects with GSTM1-positive and GSTM1-null genotypes. 

Conclusions: Exposure of healthy young adults to 0.06 ppm ozone for 6.6 hours causes a significant decrement of FEV1 and increase in neutrophilic inflammation in the airways. GSTM1 genotype alone appears to have no significant role in modifying the effects."

Exposure of BEAS-2B cells to 0.4ppm ozone for 4h significantly increased IL-8 release, with a modest reduction in intracellular reduced glutathione (GSH). Ozone exposure induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and NF-?B activation. Pharmacological inhibition of NF-?B activation or mutation of the IL-8 promoter at the ?B-binding site significantly blocked ozone-induced IL-8 production or IL-8 transcriptional activity, respectively. Knockdown of GSTM1 in BEAS-2B cells enhanced ozone-induced NF-?B activation and IL-8 production. Consistently, an ozone-induced overt increase in IL-8 production was detected in GSTM1-null primary human bronchial epithelial cells. In addition, supplementation with reduced GSH inhibited ozone-induced ROS production, NF-?B activation, and IL-8 production.

The RT-PCR analysis revealed that ChSeco activates the expression of genes involved in the death receptor (extrinsic) pathway. The significance of this pathway was also evident from the increased activity of caspase-8. The overexpression of Apaf-1, loss of mitochondrial transmembrane potential, release of cytochrome c, and increased activity of caspase-9 provide further evidence for the involvement of a mitochondrial (intrinsic) pathway. Time-course analysis of ChSeco-exposed H9c2 cells showed an upstream increase in the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and an associated decrease in the intracellular glutathione.

The formation of Abeta aggregates in situ was dose-dependent at ChSeco concentrations ranging from 1 to 20 microM. The increase in insoluble Abeta aggregates at increasing concentrations of ChSeco was accompanied by a decrease in soluble Abeta as evidenced by Western blot analysis. The formation of ROS in neuronal cells was found to be dose- and time-dependent with the magnitude being higher at 20 microM compared to 10 microM ChSeco or untreated controls. The increase in ROS was associated with depletion of GSH. The cytotoxicity induced by ChSeco involved changes in phosphatidylserine translocation, DNA fragmentation, and caspase 3/7 activity that are characteristic of apoptosis. Pretreatment of neuronal cells with Trolox, a water-soluble analog of alpha-tocopherol offered partial, but significant protection against ChSeco-induced cell death, whereas, N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC) completely prevented the cytotoxic effects of ChSeco. NAC and Trolox were without any effects on ChSeco-induced Abeta aggregation. Fibrillogenesis inhibitors, which inhibited Abeta aggregation, did not inhibit cell death induced by ChSeco, implying that ROS generation, and not Abeta aggregation, plays a major role in the observed cytotoxicity.

Symptom questionnaires were administered before and after exposure, and pulmonary function tests (FEV1, FVC, and specific airway resistance [SRaw]) were performed before, during, and immediately after each exposure. Fiberoptic bronchoscopy, with proximal airway lavage (PAL) of the isolated left main bronchus and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL; bronchial fraction, the first 10 ml of fluid recovered) of the right middle lobe, was performed 18 h after each exposure. The PAL, bronchial fraction, and BAL fluids were analyzed for the following endpoints: total and differential cell counts; total protein, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), fibronectin, interleukin-8 (IL-8), granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), myeloperoxidase (MPO), and transforming growth factor-beta (TGF beta 2) concentrations. We found a significant O3 effect on FEV1, FVC, SRaw (p < 0.04) and lower respiratory symptoms (p < 0.001) for the asthmatic subjects. Ozone exposure also significantly increased the percent neutrophils in PAL (p < 0.01); percent neutrophils, total protein, and IL-8 in the bronchial fraction (p < 0.001, p < 0.05, and p < 0.01, respectively); and the percent neutrophils, total protein, LDH, fibronectin, IL-8, GM-CSF, and MPO in BAL (p < 0.001, p < 0.01, p < 0.01, p < 0.001, p < 0.05, p < 0.01, and p < 0.001, respectively) for the asthmatic subjects. There were no significant differences in the lung function responses of the asthmatic subjects in comparison with a group of normal subjects (n = 81) previously studied using an identical protocol, although there was a trend toward a greater O3-induced increase in SRaw in the asthmatic subjects (p < 0.13). In contrast, the asthmatic subjects showed significantly greater (p < 0.05) O3-induced increases in several inflammatory endpoints (percent neutrophils and total protein concentration) in BAL as compared with normal subjects who underwent bronchoscopy (n = 20). Our results indicate that asthmatic persons may be at risk of developing more severe O3-induced respiratory tract injury/inflammation than normal persons, and may help explain the increased asthma morbidity associated with O3 pollution episodes observed in epidemiologic studies."

However, in polluted urban air, O3 and NO2 occur in combination. Therefore, this project was designed to investigate the pulmonary effects of combined O3 and NO2 exposures during intermittent exercise in adolescent subjects. Twelve healthy and twelve well-characterized asthmatic adolescent subjects were exposed randomly to clean air or 0.12 ppm O3 and 0.30 ppm NO2 alone or in combination during 60 minutes of intermittent moderate exercise (32.5 1/min). The inhalation exposures were carried out while the subjects breathed on a rubber mouthpiece with nose clips in place. The following pulmonary functional values were measured before and after exposure: peak flow, total respiratory resistance, maximal flow at 50 and 75 percent of expired vital capacity, forced expiratory volume in one second and forced vital capacity (FVC). Statistical significance of pulmonary function changes was tested by analysis of covariance for repeated measures. After exposure to 0.12 ppm O3 a significant decrease was seen in maximal flow at 50% of FVC in asthmatic subjects. After exposure to 0.30 ppm NO2 a significant decrease was seen in FVC also in the asthmatic subjects. One possible explanation for these changes is the multiple comparison effect. No significant changes in any parameters were seen in the asthmatic subjects after the combined O3-NO2 exposure or in the healthy subjects after any of the exposures."

All subjects had physician-diagnosed asthma; clinically, they covered a range from minimal wheezing to persistent marked abnormality in forced expiratory performance. Control experiments included repeated sham exposures (to purified air with no ozone added) as well as brief exposures to the odor of ozone followed by purified air. No meaningful changes in forced expiratory measures, lung volumes, or single-breath N2 indices were found after ozone exposure relative to control. Symptoms, scored semiquantitatively, increased slightly but not significantly with exposure to ozone. Small but significant (P is less than 0.05) group mean blood biochemical changes occurred with exposure to ozone; these included increased glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase and lactate dehydrogenase activities, increased erythrocyte fragility, and decreased concentration of reduced glutathione. Hemoglobin concentration and acetylcholinesterase activity decreased with ozone and decreased to a lesser extent in control studies. Concentrations of ozone readily attainable in smog episodes thus appear to be capable of affecting blood biochemistry in at least some asthmatic persons, in the absence of obvious adverse pulmonary responses. Whether the biochemical effects represent harm to health or a normal response to stress remains to be determined."

Epidemiology studies show an association between ambient oxidant levels and increased asthma attacks and hospital admissions. Objective: The purpose of our study was to evaluate the response of persons with mild asthma to inhaled allergen after ozone exposure conditions similar to those observed in urban areas of the United States. Methods: Using a double-blind, counter-balanced design, we exposed 9 (5 women and 4 men) subjects with mild atopic asthma (house dust mite sensitive) to clean air and to 0.16 ppm ozone for 7.6 hours; exposures were separated by a minimum of 4 weeks. During exposure, subjects performed light exercise (ventilation =24 L/min) for 50 minutes of each hour, and pul-monary function was evaluated before and after exposures. The morning after exposure, subjects underwent bronchial challenge with inhaled house dust mite allergen (Der-matophagoides farinae). Using a series of doubling allergen concentrations, subjects inhaled 5 breaths of nebulized allergen (0.06 to 500 AU/mL) at 10-minute intervals until a minimum of a 20% decrement in FEV1 was elicited. Results: Compared with the change in FEV1 during air exposure, there was a mean 9.1% ? 2.5% (SEM) decrement in FEV1 observed because of ozone (P < .01). Seven of the 9 subjects required less allergen after ozone exposure than after air exposure; there was a 0.58 mean dose shift in the doubling concentration of allergen attributable to the ozone exposure (P= .03). Conclusion: These findings indicate that exposure of subjects with mild atopic asthma to ozone at levels sufficient to cause modest decrements in lung function also increases the reactivity to allergen. To the extent that this effect occurs in response to ambient exposures, ozone may be contributing to the aggravation of asthma."

Twenty-four subjects with mild stable allergic asthma, 12 subjects with allergic rhinitis without asthma, and 10 healthy subjects participated in the study. Subjects breathed 250 ppb ozone or filtered air (FA) for 3 h of intermittent exercise. Airway responsiveness to methacholine was determined 1 h before and after exposures, and allergen responsiveness 3 h after exposures. We determined the concentration of methacholine (PC20FEV1) and the dose of allergen (PD20FEV1) producing a 20% fall in FEV1. In the subjects with asthma, FEV1 decreased by 12.5 +/- 2.2% (mean +/- SEM; p = 0.0001), PC20FEV1 of methacholine by 0.91 +/- 0.19 doubling concentrations (p = 0.0001) and PD20FEV1 of allergen by 1.74 +/- 0.25 doubling doses (p < 0.0001) after ozone compared with FA. The changes in lung function, methacholine, and allergen responsiveness did not correlate with each other. In the subjects with rhinitis, mean FEV1 decreased by 7.8% and 1.3% when ozone or FA, respectively, were followed by allergen inhalation (p = 0.035). Therefore, our data suggest that short-term exposure to ozone can increase bronchial allergen responsiveness in subjects with mild allergic asthma or rhinitis."

Seven asthmatic patients (mean age 40 [SD 13] years), with seasonal symptoms of asthma and positive skin tests for ragweed or grass, took part in a study to investigate whether exposure to low concentrations of ozone potentiates the airway allergic response. The patients were studied during 4 separate weeks in the winter. In each week there were 3 study days: on days 1 and 3 methacholine challenges were carried out; and on day 2 the subject received one of four combined challenges in a single-blind design--air breathing followed by inhalation of allergen diluent (placebo); ozone followed by inhalation of allergen diluent; air followed by allergen; or ozone followed by allergen. The ozone concentration was 0.12 ppm during 1 h of tidal breathing at rest, and allergens were inhaled until the forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1) had fallen by 15% (PC15). There were no significant differences in baseline FEV1 after exposure to ozone but PC15 was significantly reduced when allergen was preceded by ozone inhalation: the mean PC15 after air was 0.013 (SD 0.017) mg/ml compared with 0.0056 (0.0062) mg/ml after ozone (p = 0.042). Thus, low ozone concentrations, similar to those commonly occurring in urban areas, can increase the bronchial responsiveness to allergen in atopic asthmatic subjects. This effect does not seem to be the result of changes in baseline airway function."

Broncho-alveolar lavage (BAL) was performed and protein content and differential  cell  counts were determined. RESULTS: Ozone increased bronchial responsiveness at 3 h but not at 24 h, while OA alone had no effect. At 3 h after ozone, OA induced further, but non-significant increases in bronchial responsiveness to ACh, but at 24 h after ozone, there was enhanced responsiveness. Neutrophil counts in BAL fluid increased at 3 and 24 h after exposure to ozone alone, but there were no further increases with ozone followed by OA exposure. Protein concentration was significantly increased in the ozone and OA groups at 3 and 24 h (163.4 +/- 25.6 and 128.7 +/- 7.4 mg/ml, respectively) compared to 54.0 +/- 18.1 mg/ml in the control group (p < 0.02 and p < 0.01, respectively).

We have examined (1) the effect of a preexposure to pollutants on the contraction of sensitized bronchi to a specific antigen, and (2) the effect of passive sensitization on the contraction to nonspecific agonists in bronchi preexposed to pollutants. In tissues sensitized by incubation in sera from asthmatic patients, preexposure to 0.3 mM acrolein (an aldehyde) for 10 min or 20 min significantly increased the maximal contractile response to the antigen Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus (D. Pter.) by 20.5 +/- 6.5 and 34.9 +/- 7.4%, respectively. Similarly, preexposure to ozone(1 ppm for 20 min) increased the response to D. pter. by 25.3 +/- 11.3%.

In Phase I, we measured the preexposure methacholine responsiveness of 86 normal subjects and then exposed these subjects to 0.2 ppm O3 for 4 hours with moderate exercise. Preexposure methacholine responsiveness was weakly correlated with O3-induced increases in specific airway resistance (sRaw) but not O3- induced declines in forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) or forced vital capacity (FVC). In addition, 03-induced lower respiratory symptoms were not well correlated with O3-induced changes in lung function. In Phase II, we exposed 23 normal subjects to O3, following an identical protocol to that of Phase I, and then performed bronchoscopy with proximal airway lavage (PAL), bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL), and bronchial biopsy at 18 hours after exposure. Ozone-induced increases in percentage of neutrophils and total protein concentration were observed in both bronchial fraction and BAL fluids; increased percentage of neutrophils also was observed in PAL fluid. These increases were correlated with O3-induced increases in sRaw, but not with O3-induced declines in FEV1 or FVG. Ozone also appeared to increase expression of intercellular adhesion molecule-i, an important mediator of neutrophil recruitment, in bronchial mucosa. In Phase III, we exposed a group of 19 asthmatic subjects to O3, following a protocol identical to that of Phase II. We then compared the lower respiratory symptom and lung function responses of the asthmatic subjects to those of the 81 normal subjects who participated in Phase I, Phase II, or both. The changes in the PAL and BAL fluids of the asthmatic subjects were compared with those of the normal subjects who participated in Phase II. Although both the asthmatic and nonasthmatic subjects showed significant O3-induced changes in lower respiratory symptoms, FEV1, FVC, and sRaw, no significant differences were found between the groups. For sRaw, however, a nonsignificant trend toward a greater O3-induced increase was noted for the asthmatic subjects. In contrast, the O3-induced increases in percentage of neutrophils and total protein concentration in BAL fluid were significantly greater for the asthmatic subjects than for the nonasthmatic subjects. These data suggest that although the lower respiratory symptom and lung function responses to O3 are not markedly greater in asthmatic subjects than in healthy subjects, the inflammatory response of the asthmatic lung may be more intense."

Design: A prospective, crossover study of five atopic asthmatic and five normal subjects randomly exposed to ozone and filtered purified air (FPA) for 6 h, consisting of 30-min alternating periods of rest and moderate exercise. The two exposures were separated by at least 30 days. 

Setting: A controlled exposure in a stainless steel chamber. 

Patients: Five atopic asthmatic and five normal subjects between 18 and 45 years of age. Treatment with medications was withheld from asthmatics prior to the exposures. All subjects were nonsmokers. 

Interventions: Symptoms were assessed throughout the exposures. Pulmonary function was measured at baseline, hourly throughout an exposure, and after an exposure. Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) was performed 18 h after the completion of an exposure. The BAL fluid (BALF) was analyzed for cell count and differential; the cell-free supernatant was analyzed for albumin, tumor necrosis factor (TNF), interleukin 1 (IL-1), interleukin 6 (IL-6), and interleukin 8 (IL-8). 

Results: There were statistically significant increases in IL-8 levels, as well as percent polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMNs) and PMNs per milliliter of lavage in asthmatics exposed to ozone as compared with the same asthmatics exposed to FPA and the same normal subjects exposed to ozone and FPA. Interleukin 6 was also significantly increased in asthmatics exposed to ozone. The BALF albumin, TNF, and IL-1 levels were not significantly different among the four groups. There were no differences between asthmatics and healthy controls exposed to ozone or FPA in baseline to postexposure FEV1 FVC, FEV1/FVC, and sRaw. 

Conclusions: We conclude that asthmatics exposed to ozone develop a significant BALF neutrophilia and increased levels of the cytokines, IL-8 and IL-6. These BALF findings occur even though the level of ozone exposure was not significant enough to reduce pulmonary function.

Pulmonary function was monitored during the allergen challenge and after the exposure to O3 or air. Six hours later, induced sputum was collected. After 4 weeks, the experiment was repeated with the same subjects. Allergen induced a comparable late airway response in both challenges. O3 exposure induced a significant decrease in FVC, FEV1, and vital capacity, and was associated with a significant increase in total symptom score compared with air exposure. The percentage of eosinophils, but not the percentage of neutrophils, in induced sputum was significantly higher after exposure to O3 than after exposure to air (p = 0.04). These results indicate that O3 exposure after a late airway response elicited by allergen challenge can potentiate the eosinophilic inflammatory response induced by the allergen challenge itself in subjects with mild atopic asthma.

Similar cellular responses occur in humans during allergic rhinitis. We tested the hypothesis that exposure to ozone will enhance the inflammatory and epithelial responses associated with allergic rhinitis. Ovalbumin (OVA)-sensitized Brown Norway rats were exposed to ozone (0.5 ppm, 8 h/day) for 1 day or 3 consecutive days. Immediately after each ozone exposure, animals were challenged intranasally (IN) with either sterile saline or OVA dissolved in saline (1%, 50 Al/nasal passage). Twenty-four h after the last IN challenge rats were sacrificed; nasal tissues were removed and processed for light microscopic examination and morphometric analysis of numeric densities of inflammatory and epithelial cell populations and volume densities of intraepithelial mucosubstances. A single OVA challenge caused a significant influx of neutrophils and eosinophils into the submucosa of all nasal tissues. Ozone exposure further enhanced the appearance of eosinophils in the maxilloturbinates of OVA-challenged rats but did not increase inflammation in other nasal tissues. After 3 days of ozone/OVA coexposures, the nasal transitional epithelium lining the maxilloturbinates had increased numbers of epithelial cells as well as the appearance of mucus-containing cells in areas normally absent of these secretory cells (i.e., MCM). Multiple challenges with OVA caused increased epithelial mucosubstances in the respiratory epithelium lining the septum without increasing the number of epithelial cells. Multiple exposures to both ozone and OVA caused greater increases in intraepithelial mucosubstances in the septum than those elicited by OVA alone. These results demonstrate that exposure to ozone exacerbates epithelial and inflammatory responses associated with allergen challenge. In addition, coexposure of these agents enhanced the induced production of nasal mucosubstances caused by either agent alone."

We sought to determine whether mast cell degranulation is induced by in vivo exposure to O3 in mice and whether mast cells play an essential role in the development of pulmonary pathophysiological alterations induced by O3. For this we exposed mast cell-deficient WBB6F1-kit W /kit W-v (kit W /kit W-v ) mice and the congenic normal WBB6F1 (1/1) mice to air or to 1 or 3 parts/million O3 for 4 h and studied them at different intervals from 4 to 72 h later. We found evidence of O3-induced cutaneous, as well as bronchial, mast cell degranulation. Polymorphonuclear cell influx into the pulmonary parenchyma was observed after exposure to 1 part/milllion O3 only in mice that possessed mast cells. Airway hyperresponsiveness to intravenous methacholine measured in vivo under pentobarbital anesthesia was observed in both kit W /kit W-v and 1/1 mice after exposure toO3. Thus, although mast cells are activated in vivo by O3 and participate in O3-induced polymorphonuclear cell infiltration into the pulmonary parenchyma, they do not participate detectably in the development of O3-induced airway hyperresponsiveness in mice."

These data are supported by observations in several murine models of obesity. Ob/ob, db/db, and Cpe(fat) mice each exhibit innate airway hyperresponsiveness, a characteristic feature of asthma. These mice also respond more vigorously to common asthma triggers, including ozone. Here we discuss the implications of these data with respect to several mechanisms proposed to explain the relationship between obesity and asthma: 1) common etiologies; 2) comorbidities; 3) mechanical factors; and 4) adipokines. We focus on the role of adipokines, especially TNF-alpha, IL-6, leptin, and adiponectin. Understanding the mechanistic basis for the relationship between obesity and asthma may lead to novel therapeutic strategies for treatment of the obese asthmatic subject. [References: 157]"

Such genetic deficiencies in mice are rare in humans, and they may not be representative of human obesity. Thus the purpose of this study was to determine the pulmonary phenotype of mice with diet-induced obesity (DIO), which more closely mimics the cause of human obesity. Therefore, wild-type C57BL/6 mice were reared from the time of weaning until at least 30 wk of age on diets in which either 10 or 60% of the calories are derived from fat in the form of lard. Body mass was approximately 40% greater in mice fed 60 vs. 10% fat diets. Baseline airway responsiveness to intravenous methacholine, measured by forced oscillation, was greater in mice fed 60 vs. 10% fat diets. We also examined lung permeability and inflammation after exposure to room air or O(3) (2 parts/million for 3 h), an asthma trigger. Four hours after the exposure ended, O(3)-induced increases in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid protein, interleukin-6, KC, macrophage inflammatory protein-2, interferon-gamma-inducible protein-10, and eotaxin were greater in mice fed 60 vs. 10% fat diets. Innate AHR and augmented responses to O(3) were not observed in mice raised from weaning until 20-22 wk of age on a 60% fat diet. These results indicate that mice with DIO exhibit innate AHR and enhanced O(3)-induced pulmonary inflammation, similar to genetically obese mice. However, mice with DIO must remain obese for an extended period of time before this pulmonary phenotype is observed."

Obese db/db and lean wild-type mice were exposed to ozone (0.3 ppm) for 72 h. In wild-type mice, ozone exposure caused pulmonary injury and inflammation, and these events were associated with reduced pulmonary compliance. In db/db mice, ozone-induced neutrophil recruitment to the lung was reduced and no reduction in compliance was observed. Similar results were obtained in obese Cpe(fat) mice, indicating that loss of leptin signaling in db/db mice does not account for these obesity-related changes. To examine the role of interleukin (IL)-6 in this obesity-related difference in ozone responsiveness, wild-type and IL-6-deficient mice were raised on 10% or 60% fat diets. Compared with 10% fat-fed mice, wild-type 60% fat-fed mice were obese and had reduced neutrophil recruitment following ozone. IL-6 deficiency reduced ozone-induced neutrophil recruitment in 10% fat-fed mice. In contrast, in obese mice, no effect of IL-6 deficiency on neutrophil recruitment was observed. Obesity-related differences in the effect of ozone on compliance were observed in both wild-type and IL-6-deficient mice. Obesity-related differences in serum IL-6 were observed and may account for obesity-related differences in the effect of IL-6 deficiency on neutrophil recruitment. In summary, the neutrophilic inflammation induced by prolonged low level ozone exposure was attenuated in obese mice and appeared to result from an absence of IL-6-dependent neutrophil recruitment in the obese mice."

In mice that were maintained on vA-sufficient (vA+) diet, lung and liver tissue concentrations of vA and retinyl palmitate (RP) were significantly (P<0.05) lower in the B6 strain compared with C3, as measured by high-performance liquid chromatography techniques. vA and RP levels were significantly (P<0.05) reduced in lung and liver tissues of 8-wk old B6 and C3 mice that were maintained on a vA deficient (vA-) diet. vA+ and vA- mice of both strains were exposed to air or 0.3 ppm O3/72 h, and lung injury was assessed by differential cell count and total protein concentration in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) returns. O3 exposure caused significantly (P<0.05) greater increases in inflammatory cells and a total protein in BAL returns of vA+ B6 mice than vA+ C3 mice. vA deficiency significantly (P<0.05) enhanced O3-induced increases in polymorphonuclear leukocytes in C3 mice and epithelial cells loss in both strains. Compared with vA+ mice, lung permeability was also significantly (P<0.05) enhanced in vA- mice of both strains exposed to O3. vA replacement partially reversed the O3-induced lung injury that was enhanced by vA- diet.

We hypothesized that lung injury from continuous 1-week O3 exposure would also be increased under conditions of AH2  deficiency because of (1) a diminished antioxidant pool to counteract the oxidant challenge, (2) impaired reparation of tissue injury, and/or (3) altered antioxidant redox homeostasis. Female Hartley guinea pigs (260?330 g) were made AH2 deficient by providing a diet similar to guinea pig chow, but having no AH2. The dietary regimen was started 1 week prior to exposure and was continued during exposure to O3 (0, 0.2, 0.4, or 0.8 ppm, 23 hr/day, 7 days) as well as 1 week post-exposure. Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) and tissue AH2 were measured in subgroups at the beginning of exposure (1 week on the AH2-deflcient diet), at its termination and 1 week post-exposure. AH2 measured in ear tissue punches proved to be an easy and effective monitor for AH2 deficiency. One week on the AH2-deficient diet caused a 70?80% drop in ear, lung and liver AH2, while AH2 in BAL was decreased by 90%. Immediately after the exposure, total BAL protein and albumin (markers of lung permeability) were increased (?50%) at 0.8 ppm with no difference between the dietary groups. O3 caused an increase in total BAL cells and neutrophils in a concentration-dependent manner with only a slight augmentation due to diet. Exposure to O3 caused an increase in lung and BAL AH2 in normal guinea pigs. Glutathione and uric acid were also increased in the lung and BAL after O3 exposure (40?570%) in both dietary groups, and the levels remained elevated during the recovery period. Lung ?-tocopherol was not changed due to O3. A significant overall diet-related decrease was seen in AH2-deficient guinea pigs, immediately after the exposure and recovery. In summary, lung injury/inflammation following 1 week O3 exposure and recovery were minimally affected by AH2 deficiency. Antioxidants also appeared to increase in response to O3 exposure despite the deficiency in AH2."

The defensive effect of vitamin E on ozone toxicity induced by long-term exposure to ozone was not made clear by the morphological or biochemical examination of the lung.

No significant differences in plasma or lung AT concentrations were observed in response to this level of O(3) exposure. Lung genomic responses of the lungs to O(3) were determined using Affymetrix 430A 2.0 arrays containing over 22,600 probe sets representing 14,000 well-characterized mouse genes. As compared with filtered air exposure, O(3) exposure resulted in 99 genes being differentially expressed in ATTP(-/-) mice, as compared to 52 differentially expressed genes in ATTP(+/+) mice. The data revealed an O(3)-induced upregulation of genes related to cell proliferation/DNA repair and inflammatory-immune responses in both ATTP(+/+) and ATTP(-/-) mice, with the expression of 22 genes being common to both, whereas 30 and 77 genes were unique to ATTP(+/+) and ATTP(-/-) mice, respectively. The expressions of O(3) sensitive genes-Timp1, Areg, Birc5 and Tnc-were seen to be further modulated by AT status.

The subjects walked on a motor-driven treadmill and rested in alternating 20-min periods during the 2-h exposures. Functional residual capacity and maximal voluntary ventilation (MVV) were measured pre- and postexposure. Forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1.0) and forced expiratory flow rate between 25% and 75% of vital capacity (FEF25-75%) were calculated from FVC. Residual volume (RV) was calculated from FRC. VE was measured during the last 4 min of each exercise period, and the electrocardiogram was monitored throughout each exposure. There were no significant changes in any measured parameter with FA exposure. All three O3 exposures induced small, statistically significant decrements in FVC and FEV1.0, but no significant changes in FEF25-75%. There were no significant differences among responses to the three O3 exposures. The decrements in measured pulmonary functions were smaller than typically observed in young males exposed to similar inhaled doses of O3. The data suggest possible saturation of the pulmonary response mechanism at a low degree of functional impairment in older men. Reflex-mediated impairment of inspiration, with concomitant reduction in all dependent pulmonary functions has been suggested as the mechanism of pulmonary dysfunction with O3 exposure in young adults. The results suggest that this reflex may be less active in older adults."

These studies suggest that the elderly and those with certain genetic polymorphisms are susceptible to adverse air pollution-associated health events. Hypothesis/objective: We hypothesize that physiological responses to air pollutants vary with age and are genetically influenced. Materials and methods: To test this hypothesis, we exposed mice from three inbred strains (C57BL/6J, B6; C3H/HeJ, HeJ; C3H/HeOuJ, OuJ) to ozone (O3) and carbon black (CB) at two ages, (5 months, 12 months), for 3 consecutive days, to either filtered air (FA), CB particles, or O3 and CB sequentially (O3CB) (CB, 550?g/m3; O3, 600 ppb). Heart rate (HR), HR variability (HRV), breathing, and core temperature (Tco) responses were analyzed. Results: We observed time-dependent physiological changes in response to O3CB exposure in each strain, relative to FA exposure for both age groups. Each mouse strain showed distinct adaptation profiles to repeated acute exposures to O3. In younger mice, several time-dependent effects (decreased HR and increased HRV) were prominent in HeJ and OuJ mice but not B6 mice. We also observed variability in adaptation in older mice. However, responses in older mice were generally attenuated when compared to the younger mice. In addition, cardiac?respiratory interactions were affected with CB and O3CB exposures albeit with patterns differing by age or exposure. Discussion/conclusion: Our results suggest that age considerably attenuates physiological responses to O3 and O3CB exposures. Age-related physiological changes such as increased oxidative stress in mouse tissue may be involved in this attenuation."

METHODS: We propose an interdisciplinary conceptual framework that brings together maternal and infant nutrition, air pollution exposure assessment, and cardiopulmonary and perinatal epidemiology. Five possible albeit not exclusive biologic mechanisms have been put forth in the emerging environmental sciences literature and provide corollaries for the proposed framework.

CONCLUSIONS: Protecting the environmental health of mothers and infants remains a top global priority. The existing literature indicates that the effects of PM on LBW, PTD, and IUGR may manifest through the cardiovascular mechanisms of oxidative stress, inflammation, coagulation, endothelial function, and hemodynamic responses. PM exposure studies relating mechanistic pathways to perinatal outcomes should consider the likelihood that biologic responses and adverse birth outcomes may be derived from both PM and non-PM sources (e.g., nutrition). In the concluding section, we present strategies for empirically testing the proposed model and developing future research efforts."

Nitrotyrosine residues, which are a marker of peroxynitrite formation and action, are found in placental vessels of preeclamptic and diabetic pregnancies, indicating oxidative stress. Treatment of the placental vasculature with authentic peroxynitrite in vitro attenuates responses both to vasoconstrictors such as the thromboxane mimetic U46619 and to vasodilators, including glyceryl trinitrate and prostacyclin, indicating it has caused vascular dysfunction. Further, the responses of the fetal-placental vasculature of diabetic and preeclamptic placentae to these same vasoconstrictor and vasodilator agents are significantly attenuated when compared to responses in normal control placentae. Together these data suggest there may be a cause and effect relationship between formation and action of peroxynitrite and vascular dysfunction in the placenta of both preeclamptic and diabetic pregnancies. The presence of such attenuated vascular responses indicates that perhaps the placenta may not be able to adequately respond to demands for altered blood flow in situations where this is necessary in preeclamptic or diabetic pregnancies, thus leading to further fetal compromise."

Instead, most represent part of a more complex web or ""pattern"" of conditions that are connected via underlying biological mechanisms and processes, emerge across a lifetime, and have been identified with the aid of large medical databases. OBJECTIVE: We have described how an understanding of patterns of disease may be used to develop new strategies for reducing the prevalence and risk of major immune-based illnesses and diseases influenced by environmental stimuli. FINDINGS: Examples of recently defined patterns of diseases that begin in childhood include not only metabolic syndrome, with its characteristics of inflammatory dysregulation, but also allergic, autoimmune, recurrent infection, and other inflammatory patterns of disease. The recent identification of major immune-based disease patterns beginning in childhood suggests that the immune system may play an even more important role in determining health status and health care needs across a lifetime than was previously understood. CONCLUSIONS: Focusing on patterns of disease, as opposed to individual conditions, offers two important venues for environmental health risk reduction. First, prevention of developmental immunotoxicity and pediatric immune dysfunction can be used to act against multiple diseases. Second, pattern-based treatment of entryway diseases can be tailored with the aim of disrupting the entire disease pattern and reducing the risk of later-life illnesses connected to underlying immune dysfunction. Disease-pattern-based evaluation, prevention, and treatment will require a change from the current approach for both immune safety testing and pediatric disease management."

To establish whether exposure to an environmental stressor, ozone (O3), and an allergen, house dust mite (HDMA), during early childhood promotes remodeling of the epithelial-mesenchymal trophic unit (EMTU) of the tracheobronchial airway wall by altering postnatal development, infant rhesus monkeys were exposed to cyclic episodes of filtered air (FA), HDMA, O3, or HDMA plus O3. The following alterations in the EMTU were found after exposure to HDMA, O3, or HDMA plus O3: (1) reduced airway number; (2) hyperplasia of bronchial epithelium; (3) increased mucous cells; (4) shifts in distal airway smooth muscle bundle orientation and abundance to favor hyperreactivity; (5) interrupted postnatal basement membrane zone differentiation; (6) modified epithelial nerve fiber distribution; and (7) reorganization of the airway vascular and immune system. Conclusions: cyclic challenge of infants to toxic stress during postnatal lung development modifies the EMTU. This exacerbates the allergen response to favor development of intermittent airway obstruction associated with wheeze. And, exposure of infants during early postnatal lung development initiates compromises in airway growth and development that persist or worsen as growth continues, even with cessation of exposure."

Infant monkeys were exposed episodically for 5 months to: (1) filtered air, (2) aerosolized house dust mite allergen, (3) ozone 0.5 ppm, or (4) house dust mite allergen + ozone. Studying the function/structure relationship of the same lung slices, we evaluated methacholine airway responsiveness and histology of bronchi and respiratory bronchioles. In bronchi, intrinsic responsiveness was increased by allergen exposure, an effect reduced by bombesin antagonist. In respiratory bronchioles, intrinsic airway responsiveness was increased by allergen + ozone exposure. Eosinophils were increased by allergen and allergen + ozone exposure in bronchi and by allergen exposure in respiratory bronchioles. In both airways, exposure to allergen + ozone resulted in fewer tissue eosinophils than did allergen exposure alone. In bronchi, but not in respiratory bronchioles, the number of eosinophils and neuroendocrine cells correlated with airway responsiveness. We conclude that episodically exposing infant monkeys to house dust mite allergen with or without ozone increased intrinsic airway responsiveness to methacholine in bronchi differently than in respiratory bronchioles.

Twelve of the monkeys were sensitized to house dust mite allergen (Dermatophagoides farinae) at ages 14 and 28 days by subcutaneous inoculation (SQ) of HDMA in alum and intraperitoneal injection of heat-killed Bordetella pertussis cells. Sensitized monkeys were exposed to HDMA aerosol for 2 h/day on days 3u5 of either FA (n = 6) or O3 (n = 6) exposure. Nonsensitized monkeys were exposed to either FA (n = 6) or O3 (n = 6). During the exposure regimen, parameters of allergy (i.e., serum IgE, histamine, and eosinophilia), airways resistance, reactivity, and structural remodeling were evaluated. Eleven repeated 5-day cycles of inhaling 0.5 ppm ozone over a 6-month period had only mild effects on the airways of nonsensitized infant rhesus monkeys. Similarly, the repeated inhalation of HDMA by HDMA-sensitized infant monkeys resulted in only mild airway effects, with the exception of a marked increase in proximal airway and terminal bronchiole content of eosinophils. In contrast, the combined cyclic inhalation of ozone and HDMA by HDMA sensitized infants monkeys resulted in a marked increase in serum IgE, serum histamine, and airways eosinophilia. Furthermore, combined cyclic inhalation of ozone and HDMA resulted in even greater alterations in airway structure and content that were associated with a significant elevation in baseline airways resistance and reactivity. These results suggest that ozone can amplify the allergic and structural remodeling effects of HDMA sensitization and inhalation."

This study was designed to test whether repeating cycles of injury and repair caused by episodes of ozone exposure lead to chronic airway disease and decreased lung function by altering normal lung maturation. We evaluated postnatal lung morphogenesis and function of infant monkeys after 5 mo of episodic exposure of 0.5 parts per million ozone beginning at 1 mo of age. Nonhuman primates were chosen because their airway structure and postnatal lung development is similar to those of humans. Airway morphology and structure were evaluated at the end of the 5-mo exposure period. Compared with control infants, ozone-exposed animals had four fewer nonalveolarized airway generations, hyperplastic bronchiolar epithelium, and altered smooth muscle bundle orientation in terminal and respiratory bronchioles. These results suggest that episodic exposure to environmental ozone compromises postnatal morphogenesis of tracheobronchial airways."

Starting at 30 days of age, monkeys were exposed to 11 cycles of filtered air, ozone, HDM aerosol, or ozone+HDM aerosol. Each cycle consisted of ozone delivered at 0.5 ppm for 5 days (8 h/day), followed by 9 days of filtered air; animals received HDM aerosol during the last 3 days of each ozone exposure period. Between 2-3 months of age, animals co-exposed to ozone+HDM exhibited a decline in total circulating leukocyte numbers and increased total circulating lymphocyte frequency. At 3 months of age, blood CD4+/CD25+ lymphocytes were increased with ozone+HDM. At 6 months of age, CD4+/CD25+ and CD8+/CD25+ lymphocyte populations increased in both blood and lavage of ozone+HDM animals. Overall volume of CD25+ cells within airway mucosa increased with HDM exposure. Ozone did not have an additive effect on volume of mucosal CD25+ cells in HDM-exposed animals, but did alter the anatomical distribution of this cell type throughout the proximal and distal airways. We conclude that a window of postnatal development is sensitive to air pollutant and allergen exposure, resulting in immunomodulation of peripheral blood and airway lymphocyte frequency and trafficking."

To detect functional changes in the BMZ, we measured perlecan and fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF-2). We also measured components of the FGF-2 ternary signaling complex [fibroblast growth factor receptor-1 (FGFR-1) and syndecan-4]. The width of the BMZ was irregular in the ozone groups, suggesting atypical development of the BMZ. Perlecan was also absent from the BMZ. In the absence of perlecan, FGF-2 was not bound to the BMZ. However, FGF-2 immunoreactivity was present in basal cells, the lateral intercellular space (LIS), and attenuated fibroblasts. FGFR-1 immunoreactivity was downregulated, and syndecan-4 immunoreactivity was upregulated in the basal cells. This suggests that FGF-2 in basal cells and LIS may be bound to the syndecan-4. We conclude that ozone and HDMA plus ozone effected incorporation of perlecan into the BMZ, resulting in atypical development of the BMZ. These changes are associated with specific alterations in the regulation of FGF-2, FGFR-1, and syndecan-4 in the airway epithelial-mesenchymal trophic unit, which may be associated with the developmental problems of lungs associated with exposure to ozone."

In animals exposed to O3 or HDMA + O3 there was a significant increase in the number of PGP 9.5 positive/CGRP negative cells that were anchored to the basal lamina and emitted projections in primarily the lateral plain and often intertwined with projections and cell bodies of other similar cells. We conclude that repeated cycles of acute injury and repair associated with the episodic pattern of ozone and allergen exposure alter the normal development of neural innervation of the epithelial compartment and the appearance of a new population of undefined PGP 9.5 positive cells within the epithelium."

OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to determine if these remodelling changes were reversible after 6 months of recovery. METHODS: Rhesus monkeys were exposed to a regimen of HDMA and or O3 or filtered air (FA) for 6 months. After the exposure protocol was completed FA and O3 groups were allowed to recover in FA for 6 months. The HDMA and HDMA+O3 exposure groups recovered in a modified environment. They were re-exposed to HDMA aerosol for 2 h at monthly intervals during recovery in order to maintain sensitization for pulmonary function testing. To detect structural changes in the BMZ, collagen I and perlecan immunoreactivity were measured and compared to data from the previous papers. RESULTS: The remodelled HDMA group had a significantly thicker BMZ and after 6 months of recovery the width had not regressed. In the remodelled BMZ of the HDMA+O3 group, perlecan had returned to the BMZ after 6 months of the recovery protocol, and the thin, irregular, collagen BMZ had been resolved. CONCLUSION: In summary, this study has shown that: (1) The width of the remodelled HDMA BMZ did not regress during a recovery protocol that included a sensitizing dose of HDMA. (2) The atypical collagen BMZ in the HDMA+O3 BMZ was resolved in the absence of O3. (3) Depletion of perlecan from the BMZ by O3 was reversed by recovery in the absence of O3."

Using this method, we generated age-specific, 3-dimensional, epithelial maps of the nasal airways of infant Rhesus macaques. The principal nasal lesions observed in this primate model of ozone-induced nasal toxicology were neutrophilic rhinitis, along with necrosis and exfoliation of the epithelium lining the anterior maxilloturbinate. These lesions, induced by acute or cyclic (episodic) exposures, were examined by light microscopy, quantified by morphometric techniques, and mapped on 3-dimensional models of the nasal airways. Here, we describe the histopathologic, imaging, and computational biology methods developed to precisely characterize, localize, quantify, and map these nasal lesions. By combining these techniques, the location and severity of the nasal epithelial injury were correlated with epithelial type, nasal airway geometry, and local biochemical and molecular changes on an individual animal basis. These correlations are critical for accurate predictive modeling of exposure-dose-response relationships in the nasal airways, and subsequent extrapolation of nasal findings in animals to humans for determining risk."

We found a significant difference in percent change in FEV1 , FVC, and specific airway resistance (SRaw) across the single-day exposure when compared with the change across Day 4 of the 4-d exposure. Bronchial fraction (the first 15 ml of BAL return) and BAL were analyzed for the following end points: total and differential cell counts, total protein, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), fibronectin, interleukin-6 (IL-6), interleukin-8 (IL-8), and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF). In the bronchial fraction the number of polymorphonuclear cells (PMN)s and fibronectin concentration were significantly decreased after 4-d exposure compared with single-day exposure. In BAL, significant decreases in the number of PMNs, fibronectin, and IL-6 were found after 4-d exposure versus single-day exposure.

It is yet unknown whether inflammatory and biochemical effects in lower airways of humans, as observed upon single O3 exposure, also show a diminutive response following repeated exposure to O3. The aim of this study was to investigate inflammatory, permeability, and histopathological responses in lungs of rats following repeated daily O3 exposure and to study the time course of attenuation and recovery of these effects using single O3 challenges at various postexposure times. To aid in animal-to-human extrapolation, this study and a previously reported human study (Devlin et al., 1997) were designed with similar protocols. Wistar rats were exposed for 5 consecutive days to 0.4 ppm O3 for 12 h/night. Subsequently, the time course of postexposure recovery was determined by a single challenge of 12 h to 0.4 ppm O3 after a 5-, 10-, 15-, or 20-day recovery period. Broncho-alveolar lavage (BAL) examination and histopathology were performed 12 h after this O3 challenge. To quantify the magnitude of the O3 response, results were compared with a group exposed only once for 12 h to 0.4 ppm O3 and sacrificed simultaneously. The results demonstrate that a single exposure of 0.4 ppm O3 causes marked permeability and inflammatory responses in lower airways of rats, as evidenced by enhanced BAL fluid levels of proteins, fibronectin, interleukin (IL)-6, and inflammatory cells. However, 5 days of exposure to 0.4 ppm O3 for 12 h/night resulted in a complete disappearance of these responses, resulting in BAL fluid values that were not different from those observed in unexposed controls. Postexposure analyses of pulmonary response to O3 challenges demonstrated that these attenuated responses show a gradual recovery. The data indicate that with respect to BAL fluid levels of albumin, IL-6, and number of macrophages and neutrophils, the period for lung tissue to regain its full susceptibility and responsiveness to O3 following a 5-day preexposure period is approximately 15-20 days. Remarkably, the total protein and fibronectin responses in BAL fluid still exhibited an attenuated response to an O3 challenge at 20 days postexposure. Morphometry (number of BrdU-labeled cells in terminal bronchiolar epithelium, and number of alveolar macrophages) showed that after a recovery of 5-10 days following a 5-day preexposure the response to a challenge was identical to that after a single exposure. These results suggest that complete repair from lower airway inflammation caused by short-term, repeated exposure to O3 may take longer than previously assumed."

This study examined pulmonary function and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) parameters in O3-adapted F-344 rats to explore possible mechanisms of adaptation. Of particular interest was ascorbic acid (AA), an antioxidant reported to be protective against O3 injury and found to be increased in O3-adapted rats. Adaptation was induced by exposure to 0.25 ppm O3, 12 hr/day for 6 or 14 weeks and evaluated with a challenge test, one that reexposed rats to 1.0 ppm O3 and measured attenuation in the O3 effect on frequency of breathing. Pulmonary function was assessed 1 day postexposure and adaptation and BALF were evaluated 1, 3, and 7 days postexposure. Results showed that forced vital capacity increased over time but decreased due to exposure and that the 14-week, O3-exposed rats had an increase in forced expiratory flow rate. All of the O3-exposed rats that were tested demonstrated adaptation on Postexposure Days 1, 3, and 7, but it was diminished on Day 7. Adaptation was also more pronounced in rats exposed for 14 weeks. Except for AA, BALF levels of total protein, potassium, lysozyme, uric acid, and alpha-tocopherol were unaffected by O3 exposure. Lactic acid dehydrogenase, alkaline phosphatase, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, and total glutathione were also assayed but were always below detectable limits. Ascorbic acid concentrations were elevated on Days 1, 3, and 7, showing postexposure patterns similar to those found for adaptation. Significant correlation was found between AA concentration and the magnitude of adaptation (r = 0.91, p < 0.002). We conclude that AA may play an important role in mechanisms associated with O3 adaptation in rats."

Although a number of mechanisms have been proposed to account for this response, none appear to be fully explanatory. We examined the role interleukin (IL)-6 may play in the induction of adaptation to O3-induced pulmonary injury. A statistically significant 29-fold increase in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid IL-6 levels was observed in rats exposed to 0.5 ppm O3 during nighttime hours when compared with daytime hours even though similar kinetics of inflammation were induced by each exposure. Animals receiving an initial nighttime O3 exposure showed a lesser degree of inflammation following a subsequent O3 exposure when compared with animals which received an initial daytime exposure. Rats pretreated with IL-6 both intratracheally and intraperitoneally and subsequently exposed to O3 showed a lesser degree of cellular inflammation when compared with respective controls. Pretreatment of rats with anti-IL-6-receptor antibodies (ra) prior to the nighttime O3 exposure completely abrogated the O3-induced cellular adaptive response without effecting the inflammatory response induced by the initial nighttime O3 exposure. In fact, administration of anti-IL-6ra augmented the neutrophil influx following the second O3 exposure. Anti-IL-6ra treatment did not alter the pulmonary edema adaptive response, suggesting that the O3-induced cellular and edema adaptive responses are regulated by different mechanisms. Our data indicate that mobilization of pulmonary antioxidants does not play a role in the IL-6-mediated early cellular adaptive response and suggest that IL-6 is an essential mediator of the O3-induced cellular adaptive response."

Bonnet monkeys were exposed to 0.00 or 0.15 ppm O3 (8 hr/day) for 6 or 90 days, anesthetized, and exsanguinated. Nasal cavities were fixed with Karnovsky's fixative, decalcified, and processed for light microscopy, and sections were stained with alcian blue (pH 2.5)/periodic acid-Schiff or high iron diamine. Volume densities of secretory material in nasal epithelium were determined with the use of a Quantimet 900 image analyzer. After 6 days' exposure there were significant increases in both acidic and neutral glycoconjugates stored in transitional and respiratory epithelium. After 90 days there was significantly less mucosubstance than at 6 days. Only in the transitional epithelium did the total and sulfated mucosubstance remain greater than that of controls. Nasopharyngeal epithelium was minimally affected after 6 days of O3 and unchanged after 90 days. It is concluded that exposures to ambient levels of O3 induce significant changes in the stored secretory product of nasal epithelium."

The study objective was to examine the independent and combined associations between ambient PM(2.5) and O(3) and acute respiratory/inflammatory responses. Using their concentrated ambient particle (CAP) facility for PM(2.5), the authors studied 10 mild asthmatic and 13 nonasthmatic individuals. The 2-h exposures included CAP (range 48-199 microg/m(3)) and filtered air (FA), with/without O(3) (120 ppb), in a randomized block design. Response measures included pulmonary function and inflammatory indices in induced sputum (interleukin [IL]-6, cytology) and blood (IL-6, tumor necrosis factor [TNF]-alpha) measured before and after exposures. Three hours post exposure, there was an increase in blood levels of IL-6, but only after CAP alone exposures; the IL-6 increase was associated with increasing PM(2.5) mass concentration (p = .005). Some individuals switched to shallow breathing during CAP+O(3), possibly accounting for an attenuation of the resultant blood IL-6 response. Asthmatic and nonasthmatic responses were similar. There were no adverse changes in pulmonary function or other inflammatory measures. The study demonstrated an acute IL-6 response to PM(2.5), providing evidence to support the epidemiological findings of associations between ambient levels of particles and cardiopulmonary morbidity and mortality."

Whether prior exposure to nanoparticles influences the toxicity of O3 has not been well investigated. To determine if there are toxicological interactions between particulate and gas exposures, we examined acute pulmonary effects of a 3-h ozone exposure (0.5 ppm) in female C57Bl mice that had been preexposed to a single dose of 20 microg multiwall carbon nanotubes (CNT) by pharyngeal aspiration 12 h earlier. A total of four groups were compared: (1) PBS/air-control, (2) PBS/O3, (3) CNT/air, and (4) CNT/O3. Analyses of the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) and lung tissue samples collected at 5 and 24 h post O3 exposure were performed for various markers of cytotoxicity and inflammation using standard enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and immunoblot procedures. The results showed a pronounced cellular response and increase in various cytotoxicity/inflammatory markers in the lungs of CNT-exposed mice. Ozone by itself produced minimal effects, but in CNT-exposed animals there was a significant increase in total brochoalveolar lavage (BAL) cells and polymorphonuclear leukocytes. Additionally, protein, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, interleukin (IL)-1beta, and mucin levels in BALF at 5 and 24 h were higher in CNT-exposed animals than in corresponding air-exposed controls or animals exposed to O3 alone. A comparable increase over the controls was also observed in the CNT/O3 group, but neither an additive nor a synergistic interaction was observed in mice that received sequential exposure to CNT and ozone. In fact, some CNT-induced cytotoxic/inflammatory responses were attenuated in mice following exposure to both CNT and low levels of ozone. These results are contrary to enhanced responses that were anticipated and may represent the development of ""cross-tolerance"" reported by others for some sequentially administered pollutants."

Therefore, inhalation studies that are designed to examine the toxicity of coexposures to two or more airborne toxicants may be more relevant for assessing human health risks than those studies that investigate the toxic effects of only one airborne toxicant at a time. Furthermore, airborne biogenic substances such as pollens, bacteria, fungi, and microbial toxins often coexist with common air pollutants in the ambient air, and when inhaled may also cause specific adverse effects on the respiratory tract. One such biogenic substance, bacterial endotoxin, is a potent stimulus of airway inflammation and is commonly found in domestic, agricultural, and industrial settings. Little is known about the interaction of exposures to biogenic substances and common air pollutants, such as ozone or airborne particulate matter. In the last few years, we have performed a series of in vivo studies using laboratory rodents that examined how airway surface epithelial cells are altered by coexposure to ozone and a biogenic substance, either bacterial endotoxin or a commonly used experimental aeroallergen (ovalbumin). Results from these studies indicate that the ozone-induced epithelial and inflammatory responses in laboratory rodents may be markedly enhanced by coexposure to an inhaled biogenic substance. Conversely, the adverse airway alterations caused by exposure to biogenic substances may be enhanced by coexposure to ozone. The results from these initial studies have also suggested some of the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying the phenotypic epithelial alterations induced by these coexposures. Many more studies are needed to fully elucidate the potential risk to human health from coexposure to air pollutants and airborne biogenic substances."

Ozone exposure is linked to exacerbations of wheezing in children. Objectives: Determine if maternal pulmonary exposure to traffic-related particles during pregnancy augments ozone-induced airway hyperresponsiveness in offspring. Methods and Main Results: C57BL6 time-mated mice were given NIST SRM#1648 (PM) 0.48 mg, saline vehicle, or no treatment by tracheal insufflation twice weekly for three weeks. PM exposure augmented maternal lung inflammation and placental TNF, KC, and IL-6 (measured at gestation day 18). After parturition, dams and litters were exposed to air or ozone 1 ppm 3 hours/day, every other day, thrice weekly for four weeks. Respiratory system resistance in pups was measured at baseline and after administration of nebulized methacholine. Ozone increased airway hyperresponsiveness, but the increase was greatest in pups born to PM-treated dams. Whole lung TNF, IL-1, KC, IL-6, and MCP-1 were all increased in ozone-treated pups, with the greatest increase in pups born to dams given PM. Airway epithelial mucous metaplasia estimated by periodic acid-Schiff, Alcian blue staining was increased in ozone-exposed pups born to PM-treated dams. Alveolar development, determined by morphometry, and airway smooth muscle bulk, estimated using -actin histochemistry, were unaffected by pre- or post-natal treatment. Conclusion: Maternal pulmonary exposure to PM during pregnancy augments placental cytokine expression and postnatal ozone-induced pulmonary inflammatory cytokine responses and ozone-induced airway hyperresponsiveness without altering airway structure."

NPSH contents were increased markedly in hamsters, mice and rats, but not in guinea pigs. The activities of antioxidative protective enzymes also changed with the exposure. The most characteristic change was the significant increase in glutathione peroxidase (GPx-H2O2) activity in hamsters and rats - species which did not exhibit increases in their TBA reactant levels. The increase in this enzyme activity in mice was significant, but not very large. Furthermore, guinea pigs were genetically deficient in this enzyme, and the increase in glycolytic enzymes for regenerating NADPH was also lowest in guinea pigs. The glutathione S-transferase (GSH-Tase) activity in mice and guinea pigs was decreased by exposure to the combined gases. These results suggest that the increases in lipid peroxide levels in mice and guinea pigs may be due to a lesser ability to regenerate protective reducing substances, such as NPSH and NADPH, than that of hamsters and rats.

Aged rats displayed mild uncoupled lung mitochondria, increased SOD and GPx activities, and higher 8-oxodG content after O-3 exposure. Thus, in contrast to adults, immature and aged rats displayed lung oxidative stress after O-3 exposure. Higher sensitivity of immature to O-3 was partly related to ventilatory parameters and to the absence of antioxidant enzyme response. In aged rats, the increase in cytosolic SOD and GPx activities during O-3 exposure was not sufficient to prevent the impairment in mitochondrial function and accumulation in lung 8- oxodG.

Glutathione was measured in well-defined subcompartments of the lung of both rats and monkeys to compare alterations occurring in both target(distal trachea and terminal bronchiole) and nontarget areas (lobarbronchus, major daughter, minor daughter bronchus, and parenchyma) of the lung in species that differ in sensitivity to ozone exposure (rat is less susceptible than monkey). Glutathione concentrations were decreased intrachea of rats exposed to 0.4 ppm ozone for 2 h and increased in lobar bronchus and distal bronchiole after 2 h exposure at 1 ppm. In monkey, glutathione levels in most subcompartments were not altered by either 0.4or 1.0 ppm ozone exposure for 2 h. The exceptions were the major daughter subcompartment (200% of control at 0.4 ppm exposure) and the distal bronchiole (55% of control at 1 ppm exposure). Ninety day ozone exposures(6 h/day times 5 days/week) in rats produced an elevation in glutathione (164% of control value) only in distal bronchiole at the 1 ppm exposure level. In a similar manner, glutathione levels in the distal bronchiole of monkeys exposed for 90 days to 1 ppm O-3 were 165% of the corresponding control values. These results suggest the following: glutathione levels in target and nontarget areas of the lung and insusceptible versus less susceptible species are not the primary determinant in the differences observed in ozone toxicity; the response of lung subcompartments to short-term ozone exposure varied depending on airway subcompartment and species; increased glutathione levels may be one reason for adaptation of some airway epithelial cells from rats and monkeys exposed to O-3 for long periods; and use of well-defined segments of the lung provides a means of assessing changes in target areas of the lung without dilution from nontarget areas."

Since pulmonary injury produced by oxidant air pollutants like ozone is highly focal, involving primarily the trachea and centriacinar areas of the lung, measurements of alterations in antioxidant enzyme activities in whole lung may substantially underestimate changes occurring in target areas of the respiratory tract. We have applied a technique for preparation of lung specimens from well-defined anatomic locations to determine whether the focal injury associated with ozone exposure is related to an uneven distribution of antioxidant enzyme activity in the respiratory tract. Our study compared enzyme activities in rat and monkey, species which differ considerably in sensitivity to ozone-induced injury (monkey > rat). The activities of glutathione S-transferase varied less than twofold between different airway subcompartments for both the rat and monkey. Pulmonary veins had approximately 50% of the activity of airways in both species. Glutathione peroxidase activity was slightly higher in proximal compared to distal airways of the rat but was evenly distributed at all airway levels in the monkey. In both species, activity in pulmonary veins was lower than that in airways. The activity of superoxide dismutase was similar in rat and monkey and marked differences were not observed in the various subcompartments studied. Similarly, catalase activity was relatively evenly distributed in rat airways but, in the monkey, the distal bronchiole and lobar bronchus had marginally higher activity than the trachea. We conclude that: (1) measurement of antioxidant enzyme activities in anatomic subcompartments within the lung is feasible using microdissected specimens, (2) antioxidant enzyme activity can vary in different subcompartments of the lung of the same species. (3) the pattern of variation in enzyme activity differs by the enzyme and by species, and (4) species and subcompartment differences in ozone injury are not due primarily to differences in the distribution of antioxidant enzyme activity."

The model takes into account lower respiratory tract anatomy, transport in the lumen and air spaces, and transport and chemical reactions in the mucous and surfactant layers and in the underlying tissue and capillaries. For each species two anatomical models were used to investigate their influence in predicting absorption. Results with all four anatomical models and various ventilatory parameters showed a qualitative similarity in the shape of the dose versus airway number curves but significant differences in predicted percentage total and percentage pulmonary uptake. The percentage uptake was also sensitive to breathing frequency and tidal volume. Rat lobe models were used to study absorption in lobes and show that O3 tissue dose in centriacinar regions decreases with increasing distance from the trachea. The effect on results of values used for functional residual capacity and of values used for the chemical rate constants for O3 reactions in mucous were explored. Results differed quantitatively but not qualitatively."

Cells and fluids obtainable through bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) were examined after exposure to 18O3 to determine whether excess 18O concentrations (presumed to be reaction products of 18O3) could be detected and equated to the O3 dose to the lung. Three O3 effect measurements (increased BAL protein and neutrophils and decreased BAL macrophages) were also made in subjects or animals exposed in parallel to determine whether there was a correspondence between dose and effect measurements. Eight human male volunteers 18 to 35 yr of age were exposed to 18O3 (0.4 ppm for 2 h) with 15-min alternating periods of heavy treadmill exercise and rest. Rats (F344) were exposed identically, except without exercise. 18O3 was generated directly from pure 18O2. BAL cells and centrifugally separable surfactant material were freeze-dried and analyzed by mass spectrometer for excess 18O. Results showed that the exercising humans had four- to fivefold higher 18O concentrations in all of their BAL constituents than did the rats. The humans also had significant increases in all of the effects markers after 0.4 ppm O3, whereas the rats did not. Rats that were exposed to higher concentrations of 18O3 (2.0 ppm) had levels of 18O in BAL that were more comparable to but still lower than those of exercising humans. Changes in all of the effects markers in these rats were comparable or higher than in exercising humans. Therefore, it appears that O3 toxicity in resting rats underestimates effects in exercising humans because rats have a lower than expected dose of O3 to the distal lung. The dose and effect linkage between rats and human should improve extrapolation of animal toxicity data to humans."

The aim of this study was to examine how interspecies anatomical and physiological differences influence the transport of the inhaled gases throughout the airways and alveoli. We designed mathematical airway models of three mammalian species, rats, dogs, and humans, in which interspecies differences in airway dimensions and respiratory patterns were taken into account. We then simulated the bulk flow of three gases (ozone [O3], nitrogen dioxide [NO2], and sulfur dioxide [SO2]) and obtained the intra-airway concentrations of the gases and the amount absorbed using these models. For all three gases, both real-time and mean concentrations in the upper and lower airways were higher in humans when compared with rats and dogs. For example, the mean concentration of O3 in the 5th bronchi of humans was 3 and 12 times higher than in rats and dogs, respectively. Similarly, the amount of absorbed gases corrected for airway surface area was again higher in the upper and lower airways of humans than the other two species. Sensitivity analysis indicated that tidal volume, respiratory rate, and surface area of the upper and lower airways had significant impact on the results. In conclusion, kinetics of inhaled gaseous substances vary substantially among animals and humans, and such variations are, at least partially, the result of anatomical and physiological differences in their airways."

All species had similar basal levels of LFP (250-350 mg/ml) when a volume of saline that approximated the total lung capacity was used to lavage the collapsed lungs. Ozone effects were most marked in guinea pigs, which showed significant effects at 0.2 ppm and above. Mice, hamsters, and rats showed effects at 1.0 ppm O3 and above, while rabbits responded only at 2.0 ppm O3. Phosgene similarly affected mice, hamsters, and rats at 0.2 ppm and above, while guinea pigs and rabbits were affected at 0.5 ppm and above. Percent recovery of lavage fluid varied significantly between species, guinea pigs having lower recovery than other species with both gases. Lavage fluid recovery was lower following exposure to higher levels of O3 but not COCl2. Results of this study indicate that significant species differences are seen in the response to low levels of O3 and COCl2. These differences do not appear to be related in a simple manner to body weight. "

Cell injury was estimated immediately after O3 exposure by evaluation of ATP cell content (measured by bioluminescence) and lactic dehydrogenase (LDH) release in the culture medium. No cytotoxic effect was found: the ATP cell content of both guinea pig AM and human AM did not significantly change after O3 exposure and similarly the LDH release in the culture medium was unchanged. AM-derived cytokines (tumor necrosis factor alpha [TNF alpha], interleukin-1 beta [IL-1 beta], interleukin-6 [IL-6], and interleukin-8 [IL-8]) were evaluated in AM supernatants. O3 exposure was associated with a significant increase in cytokine secretion, with a peak value at 0.4 ppm O3. The exposure of the guinea pig AM to 0.4 ppm O3 for 60 min increased the IL-6 activity by 252 +/- 60% and TNF activity by 202 +/- 35%.

This effect, termed the hypothermic response, is primarily characterized by significant decreases in core temperature and heart rate and is generally accompanied by similar deficits in other important functional parameters. This response appears to be remarkably consistent across a wide variety of toxic agents and exposure regimens; however, the magnitude and duration of the induced effects may be modulated by changes in dose, animal mass, and environmental conditions. While the initiating stimulus and underlying mechanism(s) remains elusive, this response may represent an inherent reflexive pattern that is unique to the rodent and serves to attenuate the induced toxicity. Given that rodents are the primary animal species used in toxicological studies, it is important to consider this hypothermic response and its modulatory factors when interpreting the results of such studies and extrapolating those results to man."

To determine whether differences in the delivered dose of O3 to the lung could help explain these differences, C3 and B6 mice were exposed to 18O-labeled ozone (18O3), and the resulting 18O concentrations in pulmonary tissues were monitored as an indicator of O3 delivered dose. Body core temperatures (Tco) of similarly treated mice were measured during O3 exposures (using surgically implanted temperature probes) in an effort to correlate lung O3 dose to changes in basal metabolism. Immediately after exposure to 18O3, C3 mice had 46% less 18O (per mg dry wt) in lungs and 61% less in tracheas than B6 mice. Nasal 18O tended to be lower in the C3 mice, but these differences were not significant. Although both strains responded to the O3 exposure with significant decreases in Tco, C3 mice had a 70% greater mean temperature x time product decrease during the exposure than B6 mice. These results suggest that the strain differences in O3 susceptibility may be due to differences in O3 dose to the lung, which may be related to differences in the ability of the mice to lower their Tco in response to O3 exposure."

Recovery from 28 days of exposure was studied at 3, 7, and 28 days after exposure. Pulmonary injury and repair was studied at various time points by histology, electron microscopy, morphometry, and biochemistry. In all 3 species a concentration-related centriacinar inflammation occurred, with a maximum after 3 days of exposure. The number of alveolar macrophages and the pulmonary cell density in the centriacinar region increased progressively until 56 days of exposure, with the guinea pig the most sensitive species. Only the mouse displayed a concentration and exposure-time dependent hypertrophy of bronchiolar epithelium. After 56 days of exposure to 800 microg O3/m(3) in the rat and the guinea pig, giant lamellar bodies in type II cells were present. Exposures for 3 and 7 days at near ambient ozone concentrations (400 microg O3/m(3)) resulted in significantly elevated lung enzyme activities in the mouse, and in significant histological and morphometric changes in all 3 species. In rat and guinea pigs exposures for 56 days resulted in alveolar duct fibrosis. The highest biochemical response and the slowest recovery from ozone exposure were seen in the mouse. Histology, morphometry, and biochemistry revealed a total recovery from a 28-day exposure period in rats after 28 days, while in guinea pigs the ductular septa were still thickened and in mice all enzyme activities were still elevated in comparison with control values.

We examined age and strain as interactive factors affecting differential pulmonary responses to inhaled O(3). Male and female adult mice (15 weeks old) and neonates (15-16 days old) from eight genetically diverse inbred strains were exposed to 0.8 ppm O(3) for 5 h. Pulmonary injury and lung inflammation were quantified as total protein concentration and total polymorphonuclear neutrophil (PMN) number in lavage fluid recovered 24-h postexposure. Dose-response and time-course curves were generated using SJL/J pups, and (18)O lung burden dose was assessed in additional mice. Interstrain differences in response to O(3) were seen in neonatal mice: Balb/cJ and SJL/J being most sensitive and A/J and 129x1/SvJ most resistant. The PMN response to O(3) was greater in neonates than in adults, specifically for SJL/J and C3H/HeJ strains, independent of dose. Small gender differences were also observed in adult mice. Variation in protein concentrations and PMN counts between adults and pups were strain dependent, suggesting that genetic determinants do play a role in age-related sensitivity to O(3). Further research will help to determine what genetic factors contribute to these heightened responses, and to quantify the relative contribution of genes vs. environment in O(3)-induced health effects."

OBJECTIVE: To examine simultaneous effects of ozone and PM2.5 at levels below EPA standards on daily respiratory symptoms and rescue medication use among children with asthma. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Daily respiratory symptoms and medication use were examined prospectively for 271 children younger than 12 years with physician-diagnosed, active asthma residing in southern New England. Exposure to ambient concentrations of ozone and PM2.5 from April 1 through September 30, 2001, was assessed using ozone (peak 1-hour and 8-hour) and 24-hour PM2.5. Logistic regression analyses using generalized estimating equations were performed separately for maintenance medication users (n = 130) and nonusers (n = 141). Associations between pollutants (adjusted for temperature, controlling for same- and previous-day levels) and respiratory symptoms and use of rescue medication were evaluated. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Respiratory symptoms and rescue medication use recorded on calendars by subjects' mothers. RESULTS: Mean (SD) levels were 59 (19) ppb (1-hour average) and 51 (16) ppb (8-hour average) for ozone and 13 (8) microg/m3 for PM2.5. In copollutant models, ozone level but not PM2.5 was significantly associated with respiratory symptoms and rescue medication use among children using maintenance medication; a 50-ppb increase in 1-hour ozone was associated with increased likelihood of wheeze (by 35%) and chest tightness (by 47%). The highest levels of ozone (1-hour or 8-hour averages) were associated with increased shortness of breath and rescue medication use. No significant, exposure-dependent associations were observed for any outcome by any pollutant among children who did not use maintenance medication. CONCLUSION: Asthmatic children using maintenance medication are particularly vulnerable to ozone, controlling for exposure to fine particles, at levels below EPA standards."

However, the results of a 6.6-h face-mask exposure to 0.08 ppm O3, compared to some previous chamber exposure study results, revealed several small incongruities that may be due primarily to high individual subject ""noise"" in responses to a relatively low O3 exposure. To resolve these differences, it was the primary purpose of this study to compare chamber exposure responses to those elicited via face-mask exposure to 0.08 ppm O3 for 6.6 h with subjects serving as their own controls. Two types of O3 exposure patterns were used: (1) the usual square-wave profile, and (2) an acute triangular profile, in which O3 concentration was increased each hour from 0.03 ppm to 0.15 ppm during h 4 and then decreased each hour to 0.05 ppm (mean = 0.08 ppm). Thirty young adults (15 of each gender) served as subjects. The two exposure methods (i.e., face mask and chamber) yielded near identical total inhaled O3 doses in both the square-wave and triangular exposure profiles, and produced very similar postexposure pulmonary function, symptoms, and exercise ventilatory pattern responses. However, pulmonary function and symptoms responses became statistically significant from preexposure at the end of h 4 (when [O3] = 0.15 ppm) in the triangular protocols, but not until h 6 in the square-wave protocols. These results support previous evidence that O3 concentration has a greater singular effect in the total inhaled O3 dose than do VE and exposure duration."

Results of the 1.4-h FA recovery following the two chamber O(3) exposures showed different rates of FEV(1.0) and symptoms rectification that appeared related to the total O(3) dose (product of O(3) concentration, ventilation rate, and duration). More data are needed to clarify short-term recovery of O(3)-induced pulmonary effects and how they may be related to the more abundant data available on the delayed recovery of pulmonary function seen over longer time periods, such as 24 h."

A low-cost face-mask O3 exposure system was developed in this laboratory and found to produce closely similar pulmonary responses to those observed in prolonged exposures by U.S. EPA investigators. The primary purpose of the present study was to investigate the pulmonary function and subjective symptoms effects of 6.6-h square-wave exposure to 0.12 ppm O3 by these two methods using the same group of subjects. In addition, further investigation of pulmonary function and symptoms responses upon 6.6-h exposures to lower levels of O3 (0.04-0.08 ppm) were studied with the face-mask inhalation system. Thirty young adult subjects completed five 6.6-h exposures with six 50-min periods of exercise at an intensity requiring a minute ventilation rate (VE) of ~20 L/min/m2 of body surface area, each followed by 10 min of rest, except following 3 h when the rest period was lengthened for a lunch break. The total O3 doses for the chamber and face-mask exposures to 0.12 ppm O3 were not significantly different from each other, since the additional O3 dose during the 35 min lunch break in the chamber exposure was offset by a slightly lower average exercise VE (i.e., 19.1 L/min/m2). The data convincingly demonstrated that the two methods of exposing young adults to nearly identical total inhaled O3 doses at 0.12 ppm produce very similar pulmonary function, symptoms, and exercise ventilatory pattern responses. On the other hand, results of the 6.6-h face-mask exposures to 0.08 ppm O3 in the present study, compared to similar U.S. EPA exposure study results, revealed several incongruities that may be due primarily to high individual subject variability in responses to a relatively low O3 exposure. Thus, a comparison of chamber exposure responses to those elicited via face-mask exposure to 0.08 ppm O3 in the same subject group seems warranted."

During exposure, subjects performed exercise for a total of 5 h, which required a minute ventilation of 40 I/min. Significant O3-induced decrements were observed for forced vital capacity (FVC, -0.25 I), forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1.0, -0.35 I) and mean expiratory flow rate between 25% and 75% of FVC (FEF25-75, -0.57 I/s), and significant increases were observed in airway reactivity (35%), specific airway resistance (0.77 cm H2O/s), and respiratory symptoms. These results essentially confirm previous findings. A large range in individual responses was noted (e.g., percentage change in FEV1.0: 4% increase to 38% decrease).

The present study was designed to compare the pulmonary function and symptoms of breathing discomfort responses to a 6.6-h square-wave 0.08-ppm O3 chamber exposure to those observed in a triangular O3 exposure profile (mean of 0.08 ppm), as well as to both a 0.06-ppm square-wave and triangular mean 0.06-ppm exposure, and to those observed during a triangular mean 0.04-ppm exposure and to a filtered air (FA) square-wave exposure. Thirty young adults (15 of each gender) served as subjects, each completing all exposures. While the 6.6-h postexposure responses to the acute triangular exposure to a mean O3 concentration of 0.08 ppm did not differ significantly from those observed in the square-wave exposure, forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV)1.0 and total symptoms severity (TSS) were significantly different from preexposure at 4.6 h (when O3 concentration was 0.15 ppm) in the triangular exposure, but not until 6.6 h in the square-wave exposure. Thus, significant pulmonary function and symptoms responses were observed over a longer period in the triangular exposure protocol at a mean O3 concentration of 0.08 ppm. These results support previous evidence that O3 concentration has a greater singular effect in the total inhaled O3 dose than do VE and exposure duration. Subtracting pulmonary function effects consequent to O3 exposure to existent 8-h average background levels (e.g., ~0.04 ppm, rather than those observed in FA exposures) from those observed at higher concentrations (e.g., ~0.08 ppm) represents a means of focusing the regulatory effort on effects that can be controlled. The greatest pulmonary function and symptoms responses observed for a 0.04-ppm triangular exposure were nearly the same as those for the FA square-wave exposure. Thus, results of the present study show that calculating the net pulmonary function effect of exposure to 0.08 ppm with ocorrectiono for FA response, or for that incurred for 0.04 ppm O3, does not result in any statistically significant difference."

Identification of the minimal ozone (O-3) concentration and/or dose that induces measurable lung function decrements in humans is considered in the risk assessment leading to establishing an appropriate National Ambient Air Quality Standard for O-3 that protects public health. Objectives: To identify and/or predict the minimal mean O-3 concentration that produces a decrement in FEV1 and symptoms in healthy individuals completing 6.6-hour exposure protocols. Methods: Pulmonary function and subjective symptoms were measured in 31 healthy adults (18-25 yr, male and female, nonsmokers) who completed five 6.6-hour chamber exposures: filtered air and four variable hourly patterns with mean O-3 concentrations of 60, 70, 80, and 87 parts per billion (ppb). Measurements and Main Results: Compared with filtered air, statistically significant decrements in FEV1 and increases in total subjective symptoms scores (P < 0.05) were measured after exposure to mean concentrations of 70, 80, and 87 ppb O-3. The mean percent change in FEV1 (+/- standard error) at the end of each protocol was 0.80 +/- 0.90, -2.72 +/- 1.48, -5.34 +/- 1.42, -7.02 +/- 1.60, and -11.42 +/- 2.20% for exposure to filtered air and 60, 70, 80, and 87 ppb O-3, respectively. Conclusions: Inhalation of 70 ppb O-3 for 6.6 hours, a concentration below the current 8-hour National Ambient Air Quality Standard of 75 ppb, is sufficient to induce statistically significant decrements in FEV1 in healthy young adults."

To determine the effects of repeated prolonged low-concentration ozone exposure, we exposed 17 healthy nonsmoking male subjects to 0.12 m ozone for 6.6 h on 5 consecutive days. Subjects were also exposed once to filtered air. Volunteers exercised at a ventilation of similar to 39 L/min for 50 min of each hour during the exposure. Spirometry, plethysmography, and symptom responses were obtained before, during, and after each exposure. Nasal lavage and aerosol bolus dispersion were obtained before and after exposure. Spirometry decreased and symptoms increased on the first day. Responses were less on the second day compared with those on the first day, and they were absent compared with control values on the subsequent 3 days of ozone exposure. Percent change in FEV(1) after ozone exposure compared with that after air exposure averaged -12.79, -8.73, -2.54, -0.6, +0.18% for Days 1 to 5 of ozone exposure, respectively. FEV(1) responses ranged from a zero to 34% decrease on Days 1 and 2. After each exposure, we determined the ratio of SRaw after inhaling a fixed dose of methacholine to SRaw after inhaling saline aerosol, as an index of airway responsiveness. Airway responsiveness was significantly increased after each ozone exposure. The mean ratios were 2.22, 3.67, 4.55, 3.99, 3.24, and 3.74 for filtered air and ozone Days 1 to 5, respectively. Symptoms of cough and pain on deep inspiration increased significantly on ozone Day 1 only. We conclude that repeated prolonged exposure to low levels of ozone results in progressive attenuation of symptom and spirometric responses without an augmented response on Day 2. However, the increased airway responsiveness, although tending to return toward baseline values in some subjects, was not fully attenuated after 5 days."

The objective of this study was to determine the extent of pulmonary function decrements, respiratory discomfort, and increased airway reactivity to methacholine induced by exposure to O3 below 0.12 ppm. Separate 6.6-h chamber exposures to 0.00, 0.08, 0.10, and 0.12 ppm O3 included six 50-min periods of moderate exercise (E = 39 L/min, HR ? 115 bpm, and O2 = 1.5 L/min). Each exercise period was followed by 10 min of rest. A 35-min lunch break was included midway through the exposure. Although not intended as an exact simulation, the overall duration, intensity, and metabolic requirements of the exercise performed were representative of a day of moderate to heavy work or play. Preexposure FEV1 averaged 4.39 L, and essentially no change (+0.03 L) occurred with exposure to 0.00 ppm O3. Significant decreases (p < 0.01) of ?0.31, ?0.30, and ?0.54 L were observed with exposures to 0.08, 0.10, and 0.12 ppm, respectively. The provocative dose of methacholine required to increase airway resistance by 100% (PD100) was 58 cumulative inhalation units (CIU) following exposure to 0.00 ppm and was significantly reduced (p < 0.01) to 37 CIU at 0.08, 31 CIU at 0.10, and 26 CIU at 0.12 ppm O3; reductions in PD100 are considered indicative of increases in nonspecific airway responsiveness. We conclude that exposure to O3 at levels often found in ambient air while engaged in activity representative of a typical day of moderate to heavy work or play induced clinically meaningful pulmonary responses."

Several recent studies have suggested that in estimating exposure dose (O3 concentration [C] x exposure time [T] x ventilation [V]), O3 concentration needs to be weighted more heavily than either ventilation or duration of exposure in the estimates. In this study we tested the hypothesis that regardless of concentration pattern and exposure rate the same exposure dose of O3 will induce the same spirometric response. We exposed 23 healthy male volunteers (20 to 35 yr of age) for 8 h to air, 0.12 ppm O3 (steady-state), and a triangular exposure pattern (concentration increased steadily from zero to 0.24 ppm over the first 4 h and decreased back to zero by 8 h). During the first 30 min of each hour, subjects exercised for 30 min at minute ventilation (VE) approximately 40 L/min. The order of the exposures was randomized, and the exposures were separated by at least 7 days. The response patterns over the 8-h periods for spirometric variables in both O3 exposures were statistically different from air exposure changes and from each other. For FEV1 the p values were 0.017 between air and steady-state profile, 0.002 between air and triangular profile, and 0.037 between steady-state and triangular profiles. Although in the triangular pattern of exposure the maximal O3 concentration was reached at 4 h, the maximum FEV1 decrement (10.2%) was observed at 6 h of exposure.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

We first conducted an n-fold cross-validation of the model using samples of the original EPA data from which the model was developed. We then identified seven more recently published studies with controlled exposures to a wide range of ozone exposure patterns relevant to the current ambient ozone health standard and used the model to calculate the mean predicted responses for the exposure conditions of the individual studies that we compared to the mean observed responses reported in these studies. The n-fold cross-validation indicated good internal agreement between mean predicted and mean observed responses in the original data used to develop the model. The model accurately captured the patterns of response in each of the seven independent studies with a tendency to overpredict the observed responses by about 1 percentage point of FEV1 decrement on average. We conclude that the model is currently capable of predicting human FEV1 responses across a wide range of dynamic exposure conditions and anticipate further improvements in predictions with the addition of low-concentration exposure data."

The purpose of the current analysis was to identify and evaluate a dynamic model of FEV1 response using a large existing data set (541 volunteers, 864 exposures, 3485 FEV1 measures) with a wide range of exposure conditions (ozone = 0.0 to 0.4 ppm, activity level = rest to heavy exercise, duration = 1 to 7.6 h), including recovery in clean air. A previously described model containing a differential equation and a logistic function was modified to include a new between-subjects variance structure and was fitted to the data. The model described well the mean observed response data across the range of exposure conditions, including the periods of recovery in clean air. Predicted values of individual responses were distributed lognormally and appeared to accurately describe the distribution of observed responses. We observed that responsiveness to ozone decreased with age, that response was weakly related to body size, and that response was marginally more sensitive to changes in ozone concentration than to changes in minute ventilation. In summary, we have identified a dynamic ozone exposure-response model that accurately describes the temporal pattern of FEV1 response to a wide range of changing exposure conditions and that may have utility for predicting population responses to ambient exposures."

In order to determine if recovery of pulmonary function would be facilitated by increased ventilation due to maximum exercise, a control condition was conducted with subjects resting for a period equivalent to the maximum exercise condition. Eight males and five females participated in eight different conditions in order to answer these two questions. Resting 2-h exposure to 0.75 and 0.50 ppm ozone caused significant decrements in forced vital capacity of 10% and 5%, respectively. However, 0.00 and 0.25 ppm ozone induced no pulmonary decrement. None of the pollutant conditions reduced subsequent maximum exercise performance (ml O2.min-1.kg-1, heart rate, and total performance time). The pulmonary function responses after the maximum capacity test returned to pre-ozone values for the 0.50 ppm condition, but were still significantly decreased for the 0.75 ppm condition. The increased ventilatory exchanges from maximum exercise did not facilitate the return of pulmonary function. It appeared that increased ventilation during ozone exposure plays a significant role only in inducing pulmonary function decrement, but not in facilitating the return of pulmonary function to normal values."

Each subject attempted to maintain submaximal exercise on a cycle ergometer equivalent to approximately 70% of maximal oxygen consumption (VO2max) for 60 min, followed by incremented (maximal) exercise until exhaustion. During submaximal exercise, average minute ventilation (VE) (89 L/min), VO2 (51 ml/min/kg or 72% VO2max), work load (260 W), and work time (57 min) were similar across all exposures. During maximal exercise, average peak VE (150 L/min), VO2 (68 ml/min/kg), work load (382 W), and ride time (263 s) were similar between 0.12 ppm O3 and FA.

The observed alterations in lung functions in these subjects indicate that individuals performing heavy continuous exercise are more likely to be affected by lower O3 levels."

Ten healthy, well-trained long-distance runners were exposed on six occasions for 1 h to O3 concentrations of 0, 0.20, or 0.35 parts per million (ppm), during exercise simulating either training or competition, with mean VE = 77.5 1 X min -1. Standard pulmonary function tests, subjective symptoms, and periodic observations of exercise ventilatory response and respiratory metabolism were obtained. Statistical analyses revealed no significant exercise mode effect for pulmonary function, but a significant O3 effect for forced vital capacity and expiratory volume at 1 s was observed. Altered exercise ventilatory pattern response was noted, but there was no significant O3 effect on exercise oxygen uptake, heart rate, VE, or alveolar ventilation. Subjective symptoms increased with O3 concentration. Statistically significant pulmonary function impairment observed at 0.20 ppm O3 suggests that endurance athletes may be more susceptible to the effects of a given O3 concentration than normal young adult males as a result of sustained high mean VE incurred during training and competition. Three subjects were unable to complete both the training and competitive simulations at 0.35 ppm O3. Performance decrements appeared to be the result of physiologically induced respiratory discomfort rather than decrements in pulmonary gas exchange and/or oxygen transport and delivery."

Two individual subjects showed possible responses at 0.14 ppm, and one of them also at 0.12 ppm. In comparison to some previous investigations, this study showed generally less response to O3.

Further, in prolonged exposures, the relationship of body size to FEV1.0 response to a given O3 exposure dose has not been systematically examined. In the present study, 30 young adults were exposed on four occasions for 6 h (during a 6.6-h period) to constant 03 levels of zero (filtered air, FA) or 0.12 parts per million (ppm). At the latter concentration, exercise V(E) was varied in exposures to 17, 20, and 23 l min(-1) m(-2) of BSA, respectively, for each individual to achieve an equivalent ventilation rate, EVR). In the FA exposure, EVR was 23 l min(-1) m2. Percent changes in FEV1.0 for the three 0.12 ppm O3 exposures were significantly greater than that for FA, but did not differ significantly from each other. For the 6.6-h exposures, exercise EVR at or in excess of 17 l min(-1) m(-2), SS values were significantly greater than those observed for the FA protocol. Further, SS values at 6.6 h of exposure to 0.12 ppm O3 for the exercise EVR of 23 l min(-1) m(-2) protocol were significantly greater than for the 0.12 ppm O3 exercise EVR of 17 l min(-1) m(-2) protocol. To achieve a widened EVR, two 1-h exposures to 0.30 ppm O3 with continuous exercise (CE) at a level necessitating an EVR of 17 and approximately 34 l min(-1) m(-2), respectively, were completed by each subject. All postexposure pulmonary function and SS responses were significantly greater for the higher 1-h EVR protocol. In all exposures with significant O3-induced changes in FEV1.0 and SS, it was found that the smaller subjects who exercised at the lowest absolute V(E) had significantly smaller responses than did the larger subjects. These results strongly suggest that for the O3 concentrations and exposure durations used in this study, the effect of V(E) on O3-induced FEV1.0 and SS responses is not body-size-dependent."

A recent study provided previously unavailable clinical data for 30 healthy young adults exposed to O(3) at 0.06 ppm. That study showed significant effects of 0.08 ppm on lung function, confirming the findings of others. However, exposure to 0.06 ppm O(3) was not reported to significantly affect lung function. OBJECTIVES: We conducted this analysis to reevaluate the existing lung function data of the volunteers previously exposed to 0.06 ppm O(3). METHODS: We obtained pre- and postexposure data on forced expiratory volume in 1 sec (FEV(1)) for all subjects who were previously exposed for 6.6 hr to filtered air or to 0.06 ppm or 0.08 ppm O(3). We used standard statistical methods appropriate for paired comparisons to reanalyze FEV(1) responses after exposure to 0.06 ppm O(3) relative to filtered air. RESULTS: Controlling for filtered air responses, 24 of the 30 subjects experienced an O(3)-induced decrement in FEV(1). On average, 0.06 ppm O(3) exposure caused a 2.85% reduction in FEV(1) (p < 0.002), which was consistent with the predicted FEV(1) response from existing models. Although the average response was small, two subjects had > 10% FEV(1) decrements. CONCLUSIONS: Exposure to 0.06 ppm O(3) causes a biologically small but highly statistically significant decrease in mean FEV(1) responses of young healthy adults."

(1992) compared pulmonary function responses during 8-h square-wave exposures to FA and to 0.12 ppm O3, as well as to an acute triangular exposure to a mean O3 concentration of 0.12 ppm. With 30 min of moderate exercise each hour during 8 h of continuous exposure, significantly greater pulmonary function responses were observed between 5 h and 7 h when O3 was varied in an acute triangular configuration from 0.00 ppm to 0.24 ppm over the first 4 h and back to 0.00 ppm during the last 4 h than when O3 concentration was maintained constant at 0.12 ppm throughout. These investigators employed equal periods of 30 min of exercise, in which mean VE was approximately 40 L/min, and 30 min of rest, with pulmonary function measurements taken at the end of each hour. This procedure (i.e., taking measurements at the end of each hour) could attenuate the full effect that would be observed very soon after exercise cessation, and permit some recovery to occur. Accordingly, in the present study, the primary objective was to determine what effect observations of pulmonary responses assessed immediately following repeated 30 min exercise bouts, as well as those at the end of each hour (following approximately 30 min rest) during 8-h square-wave exposures to FA and to 0.12 ppm O3, as well as to an acute triangular exposure to a mean O3 concentration of 0.12 ppm. During the last 4 h of the 8-h, 0.12-ppm square-wave exposure, the 30-min mean increases in FEV1.0 responses were consistently greater at the end of the first half hour immediately following exercise (-1.22%) than at the end of the second half-hour following 30 min of rest (+0.01%). Further, even though O3 concentration was steadily decreasing from 0.24 ppm to 0 ppm during the last 4 h of the triangular exposure, similar increases in FEV1.0 decrement (-1.38%) immediately after each 30 min exercise bout, and small recovery at the end of each 30 min rest (+0.56%) were observed. Symptom scores in both exposures during the last 4 h also showed this effect."

The nonlinear dose?response relationship affects the efficacy of the current 8-h O3 standard to describe adequately the observed spirometric response to typical diurnal O3 exposure patterns. We have reanalyzed data from five controlled human response to O3 health laboratory experiments as reported by Hazucha et al. (1992), Adams (2003, 2006a, 2006b), and Schelegle et al. (2009). These investigators exposed subjects to multi-hour variable/stepwise O3 concentration profiles that mimicked typical diurnal patterns of ambient O3 concentrations. Our findings indicate a common response pattern across most of the studies that provides valuable information for the development of a lung function (FEV1)?based alternate form for the O3 standard. Based on our reanalysis of the realistic exposure profiles used in these experiments, we suggest that an alternative form of the human health standard, similar to the proposed secondary (i.e., vegetation) standard form, be considered. The suggested form is an adjusted 5-h cumulative concentration weighted O3 exposure index, which addresses both the delay associated with the onset of response (FEV1 decrement) and the nonlinearity of response (i.e., the greater effect of higher concentrations over the mid- and low-range values) on an hourly basis."

Immediately after 2-h chamber exposures, regional ventilation and particle dosimetry were measured by gamma camera imaging. The vertical distributions of a radiolabeled gas (133Xe) and aerosol (3.5-microns-diam insoluble 99mTc-tagged Fe2O3 particles) were quantitated for upper, middle, and lower lung regions; distribution data were corrected for regional differences in lung volume and tissue attenuation. Indexes of mechanical function, inspiratory capacity, and mid-maximal expiratory flow rates were significantly reduced after O3, but functional residual capacity remained unchanged. Exposure to O3 significantly enhanced the fraction of respired aerosol retained by the lung and altered the distribution pattern of deposited aerosol by increasing particle deposition to the middle lung region (P &lt; 0.05). Aerosol penetration indexes, i.e., ratio of particle deposition in central lung regions to that in peripheral lung regions, and particle retention 24 h postinhalation (an index of aerosol deposition within alveoli and slowly clearing bronchioles) indicated that particle filtration efficiency had increased for tracheobronchial and parenchymal lung regions. For seven of the nine subjects, regional ventilation after O3 was reduced by 14% to the lung base and enhanced by 8 and 6% to the upper and middle lung regions, respectively; these changes were significant (P &lt; 0.02) compared with ventilation after filtered air.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

Fifteen (six male; mean age, 31.1 ? 2.1 yr) healthy nonsmokers were exposed to 400 parts per billion (ppb) ozone for 2 h with intermittent exercise. Spirometry, exhaled carbon monoxide (CO) and nitric oxide (NO) levels, measurement of methacholine reactivity, and collection of exhaled air condensate and induced sputum
samples were performed at baseline, preexposure, and at intervals up to 24 h postexposure. Ozone exposure led to significant decreases in spirometry and increased methacholine reactivity and sputum neutrophils and myeloperoxidase (MPO). There were no changes in exhaled NO and CO levels, or exhaled breath nitrite after ozone exposure. There were no differences in any of the parameters after treatment with budesonide compared with placebo, and no differences in the response to ozone

The randomized 75-min exposures included two 30-min exercise periods at V(E) approximately 40 L/min. Responses were measured before, during, and after exposure and at 18 and 42 h postexposure. FVC, FEV(1), and FIV(0.5) decreased (p <.01) immediately postexposure by 13.2%, 19.9%, and 20.8%, respectively, and the airway responsiveness was significantly increased. Raw increased (p <.05), while TGV remained essentially unchanged. At 18 h postexposure, the airways were still hyperresponsive and FEV(1) and FIV(0.5) were still 5% below the preexposure levels. There were no residual effects in any of the variables at 42 h postexposure. During exercise in ozone the tidal volume was decreased (-14%) and respiratory frequency increased (+15%). The changes in airway responsiveness were not related to changes in spirometric measurements. We found no significant differences between postair and postozone mouth occlusion pressure (Pm(0.1)) and the hypercapnic response to CO(2) rebreathing. We conclude that ozone induced typical acute changes in airway responsiveness and that ventilatory (exercise), spirometric (inspiratory and expiratory), and plethysmographic pulmonary function may show some residual effects for up to 18 h after exposure. The ozone-induced alteration in breathing pattern during exercise does not appear to be related to a change in ventilatory drive."

Thirty-two subjects were exposed to1 of 5 O3 concentrations (0.12, 0.18, 0.24, 0.30, or 0.40 ppm), and each underwent one or more repeat exposures separated by from 3 wk to 14 months. Magnitudes of change for pulmonary function variables, respiratory rate and tidal volume, and for reported symptoms were compared for the repeated exposures. Changes induced in forced expiratory spirometric measurements were highly reproducible for as long as 10 months and for all tested O3 concentrations of 0.18 ppm or greater. This high degree of reproducibility indicates that the magnitude of response to a single exposure is a precise estimate of that subject's intrinsic O3 responsiveness. We conclude that the previously observed intersubject variability in magnitude of O3-induced effects is the result of large differences in intrinsic responsiveness to O3."

The changes in FVC, FEV1, AND FEF25-75 (p < 0.0001) immediately after O3 exposure varied widely among subjects. Histograms of the percentage changes in FVC and FEV1 did not differ from a unimodal, skewed (gamma) distribution (p = 0.99 and p = 0.17, respectively); the changes in FEF25-75 tended to deviate from a gamma distribution (p = 0.055). To adjust FEF25-75 for the confounding effects of O3 on FVC, we used multiple linear regression analysis with contemporaneous FVC as a covariable, analysis of a subgroup of nine subjects whose O3-induced FVC changes were < or = 5%, and volume correction of FEF25-75 for any changes in FVC after exposure. These analyses showed reductions in FEF25-75 unexplained by and following a different time course than the O3-induced changes in FVC. In 26 subjects also exposed to filtered air, significant effects of O3 on respiratory frequency (p < 0.004) and tidal volume (p < 0.0007) correlated weakly with FVC changes. The results confirm the wide variability in spirometric responsiveness among individuals to O3 and suggest that intrinsic narrowing of the small airways may be a significant component of the functional response."

During exposures, subjects exercised (minute ventilation, 26.4 +/- 3.0 L/min) for 7.5 min every 30 min; ventilation and gas exchange measured during exercise showed no difference between exposure days. Pulmonary function tests (spirometry, body plethysmography) obtained before and after exposures were unchanged on the air day. On the ozone day the mean airway resistance and specific airway resistance showed the largest (25 and 22%) changes (p = 0.086 and 0.058, respectively). Arterial oxygen saturation (SaO2) obtained in 8 subjects during the last exercise interval showed a mean decrement of 0.95% on the ozone exposure day; this change did not attain significance (p = 0.074). Nevertheless, arterial oxygen desaturation may be a true consequence of low-level ozone exposure in this compromised patient group. As normal subjects undergoing exposures to ozone with slightly higher exercise intensities show a threshold for changes in their respiratory mechanics at approximately 0.3 ppm, our data indicate that persons with COPD are not unduly sensitive to the effects of low-level ozone exposure."

Subjects included 9 men who had severe chronic obstructive  pulmonary disease (COPD) with subnormal carbon monoxide diffusing capacity (i.e., an emphysemic component) and 10 age-matched healthy men. Each subject was exposed to 0.24 ppm O3 and to clean air (control) in an environmentally controlled chamber at 24 degrees C and 40% relative humidity. Exposures were randomized, they occurred 1 wk apart, and they lasted 4 h. During each half-hour interval, light exercise occurred (i.e., average ventilation 20 l/min) for 15 min. During both control and O3 exposures, group mean symptom intensity and specific airway resistance (SRaw) increased, whereas forced expiratory performance decreased. The healthy subgroup's mean arterial oxygen saturation (SaO2) rose slightly, and the COPD subgroup's mean SaO2 declined slightly, during exercise. Group mean forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1.0) declined significantly in O3 exposures, compared with controls (p approximately .01). Mean excess FEV1.0 loss after 4 h in O3 (relative to control) was 8% of the preexposure value in the COPD subgroup, compared with 3% in the healthy subgroup (p > .05 [nonsignificant]). Overall FEV1.0 loss during O3 exposures, including exercise effects, averaged 19% in the COPD subgroup, compared with 2% in the healthy subgroup (p < .001). Symptoms, SRaw, and SaO2 responses, as well as healthy subjects' postexposure bronchial reactivity, differed little between O3-exposed and control subjects. We therefore concluded that in older men with or without severe COPD, O3 causes lung dysfunction under ""worst-case""  ambient  exposure  conditions,  despite older subjects' comparative unresponsiveness to O3. The combined effect of O3 and exercise on lung dysfunction is markedly greater with COPD. It is still unclear whether COPD causes an increased response to O3 per se."

Ozone is a major constituent of air pollution in the summer. Epidemiological studies have demonstrated that there is an increase in hospital admissions for respiratory diseases 1 day after peak levels of ambient ozone. This may be due to an increase in the responsiveness of the airways to bronchoconstrictor stimuli. 2. In the present study we therefore studied the effect of a controlled exposure to ozone on the maximal degree of airway narrowing to a non-specific bronchoconstrictor, methacholine, 12 h after exposure. Both non-asthmatic and mild-asthmatic volunteers were exposed to ozone. 3. The study had a single blind design. Experimental exposures were to filtered air, 0.40 ppm ozone and filtered air respectively, at 1-week intervals. The duration of each exposure was 2 h with alternating periods of 15 min rest and exercise. At 12 h after exposure, methacholine inhalation challenge tests and sputum induction were performed. 4. Twelve hours after exposure to ozone there was a significant increase in the maximal degree of airway narrowing to methacholine (P < 0.02) compared with exposure to air, in non-asthmatic as well as asthmatic subjects. These physiological changes were accompanied by a significant rise in the percentage of neutrophils in induced sputum (P < 0.02). All changes had returned to baseline values 1 week after exposure to ozone. 5. Exposure to ozone causes a transient increase in the maximal degree of airway narrowing to methacholine in both non-asthmatic and asthmatic subjects. These laboratory results, obtained using relatively high ozone exposure in carefully selected subjects, might provide an explanation for the temporal relationship between ambient ozone levels and hospital admissions for asthma."

Although the subgroups of the population that are most susceptible to O3 have not been identified, recent work in our laboratory suggested that methacholine responsiveness might be an important determinant of susceptibility to O3. PATIENTS AND METHODS: To test the hypothesis that methacholine responsiveness is correlated with FEV1 response after O3 exposure, we conducted methacholine challenge tests and O3 (0.20 ppm) and filtered air exposures for 4 h with moderate exercise on 66 healthy individuals. RESULTS: Repeated measures analysis of variance demonstrated significant changes in FEV1 (-0.82 +/- 0.63 L), FVC (-0.69 +/- 0.48 L), and specific airway resistance (SRaw) (+1.5 +/- 1.1 L x cm H2O/L/s) across the O3 exposure that persisted after adjusting for responses to air. Baseline PC100 (the concentration of methacholine that caused a doubling of the baseline SRaw) was weakly associated with O3-induced increases in SRaw (F1.54 = 2.85, p = 0.09), but not O3-induced declines in FEV1 or FVC. There was a weak association (r = -0.29) between O3- induced responses for SRaw and FEV1. The FEV1 responses for O3 were weakly associated with the symptoms of cough (r = -0.37), wheeze (r = - 0.29), chest pain on deep inspiration (r = -0.31), and shortness of breath (r = -0.37), but not with chest discomfort or sputum production. CONCLUSIONS: Although we were unable to find support for our hypothesis, we found, somewhat surprisingly, that respiratory symptoms were weakly associated or unassociated with FEV1 responses after O3 exposure. This finding implies that individuals may experience adverse effects, ie, respiratory symptoms, without large declines in lung function. Conversely, individuals may suffer large declines in lung function without prominent symptoms and, therefore, may remain in an unhealthy environment despite evidence of toxicity."

Ozone has been reported to induce airway neutrophilia in mild asthmatics, but little is known about how it affects the airways of asthmatic subjects on inhaled corticosteroids. We hypothesised that ozone exposure would exacerbate the pre-existent asthmatic airway inflammation despite regular inhaled corticosteroid treatment. Therefore, we exposed subjects with persistent asthma on inhaled corticosteroid therapy to 0.2 ppm ozone or filtered air for 2 h, on 2 separate occasions. Lung function was evaluated before and immediately after exposure, while bronchoscopy was performed 18 h post exposure. Compared to filtered air, ozone exposure increased airway resistance. Ozone significantly enhanced neutrophil numbers and myeloperoxidase levels in airway lavages, and induced a fourfold increase in bronchial mucosal mast cell numbers. The present findings indicate that ozone worsened asthmatic airway inflammation and offer a possible biological explanation for the epidemiological findings of increased need for rescue medication and hospitalisation in asthmatic people following exposure to ambient ozone."

METHODS: Twenty-three well controlled, regularly treated, mild-to-moderate asthmatic patients underwent two sequential randomised exposures to either filtered air or ozone (0.3 ppm for 2 hours) in a challenge chamber. Pulmonary function (PF) was monitored, and patients with FEV1 decrease greater than 10% from pre-challenge value were considered as responders. Immediately after each exposure, exhaled breath condensate (EBC) was collected to measure malondialdehyde (MDA). Six hours after each exposure, PF and EBC collection were repeated, and sputum was induced to measure inflammatory cell counts and soluble mediators (IL-8 and neutrophil elastase). The response to ozone was also evaluated according to the presence of polymorphism in oxidative stress related NQO1 and GSTM1 genes. RESULTS: After ozone exposure, sputum neutrophils significantly increased in responders (n = 8), but not in nonresponders (n = 15). Other markers of neutrophil activation in sputum supernatant and MDA in EBC significantly increased in all patients, but only in nonresponders the increase was significant. In nonresponders, sputum eosinophils also significantly increased after ozone. There was a positive correlation between ozone-induced FEV1 fall and increase in sputum neutrophils. No difference in functional or inflammatory response to ozone was observed between subjects with or without the combination of NQO1wt- GSTM1null genotypes. CONCLUSIONS: Markers of neutrophilic inflammation and oxidative stress increase also in asthmatic subjects not responding to ozone. A greater functional response to ozone is associated with greater neutrophil airway recruitment in asthmatic subjects."

In the secretions lining the human nasal cavity uric acid has been shown to be the only low molecular weight antioxidant present in abundance. Because this uric acid originates in the plasma, it is possible that factors affecting the levels of plasma uric acid will also alter the levels recovered in lavage fluids. Lavage fluid from 15 men (20-68 years) and 11 women (20-59 years) were collected using a modified Foley catheter which allowed each subject to suly a basal lavage (saline removed immediately after instillation) and an 'accrued' lavage (saline left in situ for 5 min) from each nasal cavity. Lavage fluids were assayed for protein, lysozyme acid uric acid. The levels of protein and lysozyme in the recovered fluids were found not to be affected by subject age or gender. Uric acid, however, was found to have a weak negative (r(2) = -0.685 basal and -0.62 accrued) correlation with age in women, but no such correlation was noted in men. Also, the levels of uric acid in women (1.3 +/- 0.3 mu M/L basal and 4.5 +/- 0.6 mu M/L accrued) were found to be lower than those seen in men (3.1 +/- 0.6 mu M/L basal and 8.4 +/- 1.3 mu M/L accrued) (p = 0.0681 and 0.0394 respectively). It is concluded that women have lower levels of uric acid in lavage fluids than men, with subject age also possibly affecting lavage uric acid. It is also proposed that such factors which lead to decreased levels of uric acid may be related to individual sensitivity to inhaled oxidants such as ozone."

These effects can be reduced via pretreatment with anti-inflammatory agents. Progesterone, a gonadal steroid, is known to reduce general inflammation in the uterine endometrium. However, it is not known whether fluctuations in blood levels of progesterone, which are experienced during the normal female menstrual cycle, could alter O3 inflammatory-induced pulmonary responses. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that young, adult females are more responsive to O3 inhalation with respect to pulmonary function impairment during their follicular (F) menstrual phase when progesterone levels are lowest than during their mid-luteal (ML) phase when progesterone levels are highest. Nine subjects with normal ovarian function were exposed in random order for 1 hr each to filtered air and to 0.30 ppm O3 in their F and ML menstrual phases. Ozone responsiveness was measured by percent change in pulmonary function from pre- to postexposure. Significant gas concentration effects (filtered air versus O3) were observed for forced vital capacity (FVC), forced expiratory volume in 1 sec (FEV1), and forced expiratory flow between 25 and 75% of FVC (FEF25-75; p &lt; .05). More importantly, the pulmonary function flow rates, FEV1 and FEF25-75, showed a significant menstrual phase and gas concentration interaction effect, with larger decrements observed in the F menstrual phase when progesterone concentrations were significantly lower. We conclude that young, adult females appear to be more responsive to acute O3 exposure during the F phase than during the ML phase of their menstrual cycles.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

Three groups were studied: nonsmoker-nonresponders (n = 12), nonsmoker-responders (n = 13), and smokers (n = 13, 11 nonresponders and two responders). Each subject underwent two exposures to ozone and one to air, separated by at least 3 wk; bronchoalveolar and nasal lavages were performed on three occasions: immediately (early) and 18 h (late) after ozone exposure, and either early or late after air exposure. Recovery of polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN) increased progressively in all groups, and by up to 6-fold late after ozone exposure. Interleukin-6 (IL-6) and IL-8 increased early (by up to 10-fold and up to 2-fold, respectively), and correlated with the late increase in PMN. Lymphocytes, mast cells, and eosinophils also increased late after exposure. We conclude that ozone-induced airway inflammation is independent of smoking status or airway responsiveness to ozone."

We hypothesized that GPxs concentration in ELF is responsive to O3 or NO2 exposure. Subjects underwent two 4-h exposures to O3 (0.22 ppm) and one to air. In another experiment, subjects underwent 3-h exposures to air and NO2 (0.6 and 1.5 ppm). Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) was performed immediately or 18 h after O3 exposure and 3.5 h after each NO2 exposure. GPx activity and extracellular GPx (eGPx) protein concentrations were determined in ELF, and their relationships to markers of lung function, inflammation, and epithelial permeability were examined. Although the total amounts were not changed, basal (air) GPx activity (223.6 +/- 24.4 mU/ml), basal eGPx protein concentration (2.62 +/- 0.25 ""mu""g/ml), and basal ELF dilution factor (152.3 +/- 8.4) decreased 40% immediately after O3 exposure and remained 30% decreased 18 h after exposure (p = 0.0001). No effect of NO2 exposure on GPxs concentration was detected. There was an inverse correlation between baseline ELF eGPx protein concentration and the change in PMN 18 h after O3 exposure (p = 0.04). Thus, O3, a strong oxidant, decreases both GPx activity and eGPx protein in ELF, whereas NO2, a weaker oxidant, does not. eGPx in ELF may protect against O3-induced airway inflammation."

Response was measured in terms of lung function changes and irritant symptoms. Initially, 59 adult volunteer Los Angeles area residents underwent screening exposures in spring, before the season of frequent high ambient O3 levels. Unusually responsive and nonresponsive individuals (N = 12 and 13 respectively) underwent followup exposures in autumn (late in the high-O3 season) and in winter (low-O3 season). All exposures were to 0.18 ppm O3 for 2 hr with intermittent heavy exercise at 31 degrees C and 35% relative humidity. Nonresponders tended to remain nonresponsive throughout. In fall, responders had lost much of their reactivity, as if they had &quot;adapted&quot; to summer ambient O3 exposures. They did not regain reactivity by winter. Clinical laboratory findings suggestive of acute respiratory illness did not appear to correlate with O3 response. Eight responders and 9 nonresponders underwent another followup exposure in spring, about 1 yr after screening. By that time most responders had regained their reactivity; individual function changes were significantly correlated with changes 1 yr earlier. These results suggest that response to O3 is a persistent individual characteristic, but can be modified by repeated ambient exposures."

Exposures to purified air alone served as controls. Responses of subjects were similar to those observed previously: Canadians on the average showed greater clinical and physiological reactivity to exposure than did Californians, who were no more than minimally reactive. Canadians also showed larger increases in erythrocyte fragility following exposure. No methodological differences sufficient to explain different results of previous studies were found. Although other possible explanations have not been ruled out entirely, adaptation of southern Californians to chronic ambient O3 exposure is a rational hypothesis to explain these results."

Los Angeles residents (N = 6) showed only minimal clinical or physiological response to O3, while new arrivals (N = 9) showed significant losses in pulmonary function and a tendency toward increased symptoms. Most biochemical responses did not differ significantly between residents and new arrivals. These results agree with others in suggesting that exposures to elevated ambient concentrations of O3 produce adaptation in a least some residents of photochemical pollution areas.

During Week 3, 13 subjects were re-exposed to O3 on Friday and 11 were re-exposed to O3 on Tuesday. Spirometric measurements (FVC and FEV1) and bronchial reactivity to methacholine showed adaptation within 2-3 days of the repeated daily exposures (Week 2). Although the duration of adaptation seen with bronchial reactivity appears longer than 7-days, the FVC and FEV1 clearly demonstrated complete loss of adaptation by 7 days, with a trend toward significance by 4 days.

(2) Does the subject develop resistance or adaptatin to the respiratory effects of ozone? The subjects were exposed for 2 h in an environmental chamber at 35 degrees C and 45% relative humidity to filtered air on day 1, to ozone on days 2 through 4, and to filtered air on day 5. Three groups of subjects were used, each exposed to a different concentration of ozone: group 1 (n = 10), 0.20 ppm of ozone; group 2 (n = 10), 0.35 ppm of ozone; group 3 (n = 8), 0.50 ppm of ozone. There were no acute or cumulative effects of repeated exposure to 0.20 ppm of ozone. With exposure to 0.35 ppm of ozone, there were decrements in forced expiratory parameters on day 2. These changes were greater on day 3, but wre largely absent on days 4 and 5. In group 3, there were marked effects of ozone on pulmonary function on day 2, but these changes were greatest on day 3. Significant effects (although of lesser magnitude) were also observed on day 4. The forced expiratory volume in 1 s decreased 8.7% on day 2, 16.5% on day 3, and 3.6% on day 4. The subjects claimed the most discomfort on day 3; many noted marked improvements on day 4, the third consecutive day of exposure to ozone. Two additional subjects were exposed to 0.50 ppm of ozone for 4 consecutive days. Although effects of ozone on pulmonary function were observed on the first 2 days of exposure, few effects were seen on the third day, and no effect was observed on the fourth day. We conclude that there is some short-term cumulative effect of exposure to concentrations of ozone above the threshold for producing acute respiratory effects. This is followed by a period of resistance or adaptation in which there is a marked lessening of the effect of ozone on pulmonary function and on the subjective feelings of discomfort associated with exposure to ozone."

A biological basis for these responses has been provided by findings from animal and human laboratory-based studies, where transient decrements in lung function, increased hyperreactivity, and airway inflammation have all been demonstrated after exposure to environmentally relevant concentrations of ozone. Although the database for ozone-induced health effects is considerable, a number of issues remain unresolved. The relationship between inhaled ozone dose and the magnitude of the resultant pulmonary response has been limited to a consideration of transient lung function decrements, as these measurements are noninvasive and easy to perform. Similar analyses addressing the relationship between ozone dose and acute pulmonary inflammation and tissue injury have not been performed. Here, the available database is more limited, and issues related to variation in study design, airway sampling, and the endpoints studied have made a similar approach more problematic. Establishing these relationships is vital in determining threshold doses of ozone below which adverse responses are negligible in the healthy population. As the magnitude of lung function decrements is not simplistically related to epithelial injury or inflammation, one cannot rely on estimates derived from these modeling studies to determine threshold values for these other biologically important endpoints. 
Here, we describe the first attempt to model the ozone doseuinflammatory response based on a metaanalysis of data from published human chamber studies, where airway responses were assessed using bronchoscopy-based lavage. Analyses of inflammatory responses were based on the percentage of neutrophils recovered by bronchoscopy-based lavage in response to a set ozone dose, expressed as a function of concentration (mg/m3), VE (L/minute/m2 body surface area), and exposure time (minutes) - CVT (mg/m2 body surface area). Analysis of altered permeability responses was more complex and relied on the fold increase in lavage total protein between the ozone and air exposures. This metaanalysis included data from 21 publications containing 23 exposures, with responses stratified into those measured early (0-6 hours) or late (18-24 hours) postexposure. 
We observed evidence of a relatively simple linear relationship between ozone dose (CVT) and neutrophilia in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid samples (r2 = 0.44, p < 0.01 at 0-6 hours, and r2 = 0.51, p < 0.01 at 18-24 hours), with the regressions cutting the upper 95% confidence interval of the control neutrophil level (postair) at CVT values of 645 (408-883) mg/m2, intercept with 95% confidence intervals at 0 to 6 hours, and 810 (491-1,130) mg/m2 at 18 to 24 hours. Simple linear relationships were also observed between ozone dose and protein leak into the airways over the early- and late-acute response time points. Together, these data highlight an underlying association between ozone dose and airway responses and indicate that an appropriately designed large-scale exposure study could investigate the question of an ozone threshold level for such endpoints. Some of the results of these studies have been reported previously in the form of an abstract."

However, the capability of asthmatics to develop tolerance during multiday ozone exposures is unclear. We exposed 10 adult volunteers with mild asthma to 0.4 ppm O3 in filtered air for 3 h/d on 5 consecutive d. Two similar filtered-air exposures during the preceding week served as controls. Follow-up O3 exposures were performed 4 and 7 d after the most recent consecutive exposure. All exposures were performed in an environmental chamber at 31 degrees C and 35% relative humidity. The subjects performed moderate exercise (mean ventilation rate of 32 l/min) for 15 min of each half-hour. Responses were measured with spirometry and symptom evaluations before and after each exposure, and a bronchial reactivity test (methacholine challenge) was conducted after each exposure. All response measurements showed clinically and statistically significant day-to-day variation. Symptom and forced-expiratory-volume-in-1-s responses were similarly large on the 1st and 2nd O3 exposure days, after which they diminished progressively, approaching filtered air response levels by the 5th consecutive O3 day. This tolerance was partially lost 4 and 7 d later. Bronchial reactivity peaked after the first O3 exposure and remained somewhat elevated after all subsequent O3 exposures, relative to its control level following filtered-air exposures. Individual responses varied widely; more severe initial responses to O3 predicted less rapid attenuation. We concluded that asthmatics can develop tolerance to frequent high-level O3 exposures in much the same manner as normal subjects, although the process may be slower and less fully effective in asthmatics."

Exercise respiratory frequency increased, and tidal volume decreased significantly in both groups in response to 0.18 and 0.30 ppm O3 exposure. On exposure to 0.30 ppm O3, the number of individual subjective symptoms reported and their severity were significantly greater for both groups than those reported for the FA and 0.18 ppm O3 exposures.

Twenty-three white males 8 to 11 yr of age were exposed once to clean air and once to 0.12 ppm O3 in random order. Exposures were for 2.5 h and included 2 h of intermittent heavy exercise. Measures of forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) and the symptom cough were determined prior to and after each exposure.

Most of the subjects had moderate to severe asthma. Daily records were kept of the environmental conditions, as well as of subject medication use, lung function, and medical symptoms. Air pollution was found to be significantly and consistently correlated with acute asthma exacerbations, chest symptoms, and lung function decrements. The pollutant most consistently associated with adverse health consequences was ozone (O3), although associations with sulfates and hydrogen ion suggest a possible role by fine particles as well. Effects were found to be roughly monotonic as a function of O3 concentration. Regression of morning (8:00 A.M.) to afternoon (5:00 P.M.) peak flow change on O3 indicated pulmonary function reductions similar to those previously reported for more active children without asthma. Moreover, analyses also indicated an increased risk of an asthma exacerbation and of experiencing chest symptoms of approximately 40% on the highest pollution day, relative to the mean. Based on these relative risk estimates, a rise in the 1-h daily maximal O3 from 84 ppb to 160 ppb was associated in this group with an increase from 20 to 28 (+/- 2) in the expected number of unscheduled medications administered/day, and from 29 to 41 (+/- 3) in the expected total number of chest symptoms/day. Thus, air pollution can be a major contributor to the respiratory problems experienced by children with asthma during the summer months."

A mobile medical screening van was used to house the spirometric equipment and travel to each camp. Continuous ozone measurements were collected over the 19-test day study period. An intense ozone episode was recorded just prior to and during the first 2 weeks of the study. The campers had an increase in respiratory symptoms with increases in ozone concentrations above 120 ppb. Exposures below 120 ppb ozone were not significantly associated with symptoms. Peak expiratory flow rate in children was the only lung function measure associated with increasing ozone concentrations, with an average loss of 4.74 ml/sec/ppb (P-value = 0.05) for the 8-hr ozone exposure measure.

Over a 3-wk period (June-July 1987) children who were attending a summer camp in the San Bernardino mountains of California performed spirometry up to three times per day during their stay at the camp. A total of 43 children were tested a total of 461 times. Ozone, oxides of nitrogen, sulfur dioxide, temperature, and relative humidity were measured continuously. Daily average measurements of total suspended particulate and the PM10 particulate fraction (less than or equal to 10 microns) were also made. Hourly ozone concentrations at the time of testing varied between 20 and 245 ppb. Regressions of each individual's FEV1 and FVC supported the view that high ozone levels reduced these lung function parameters. The average regression coefficient for FEV1 on ozone was -0.39 ml/ppb (SEM = 0.12) and for FVC -0.44 ml/ppb (SEM = 0.15), both of which were significantly different from zero. Statistical allowance for temperature and humidity increased the magnitude of these slopes. Nitrogen dioxide never exceeded 40 ppb during the time of testing and averaged 13 ppb. Sulfur dioxide's highest measurement was 8 ppb and often was at the limit of detection. Neither NO2 nor SO2 was considered in the statistical modeling. Data were divided based on whether each subject had been exposed to levels of ozone in excess of the National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS) during the several hours previous to being tested. Exposures exceeding the NAAQS indicated a significant negative relationship between ozone and FEV1, FVC, and PEFR. Data for nonexceedance periods did not indicate this negative relationship for any of the three lung function parameters, but it could not be determined if this was due to an absence of an ozone effect or to a combination of the increased variability and decreased size of this data subset. These data indicate that lung function changes on a daily basis relate in a negative fashion to ambient ozone levels. The magnitude of the changes are small and are reversed as ambient ozone decreases."

Ozone and PM2.5 concentrations measured during the study were below the current federal standards, and we found no significant associations of acute changes in pulmonary function with either pollutant.

Volunteer nonsmokers with complete covariates ( n = 530) had pulmonary function measured before and after their hikes. We calculated each hiker's posthike percentage change in forced expiratory volume in 1 sec (FEV 1 ), forced vital capacity (FVC), the ratio of these two (FEV 1 /FVC), forced expiratory flow between 25 and 75% of FVC (FEF 25-75% ), and peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR). Average O 3 exposures ranged from 21 to 74 ppb. After adjustment for age, sex, smoking status (former versus never), history of asthma or wheeze, hours hiked, ambient temperature, and other covariates, there was a 2.6% decline in FEV 1 [95% confidence interval (CI), 0.4-4.7; p = 0.02] and a 2.2% decline in FVC (CI, 0.8-3.5; p = 0.003) for each 50 ppb increment in mean O 3 .

The environmental half hour mean ozone concentrations ranged from 8 to 99 ppb. For two groups there was significant NO2 co-pollution. The asthmatics showed statistically significant ozone related increased ORs for eye irritations, the elderly for nose irritations. Significant lung function decrements (increase in ozone by 50 ppb) were found for asthmatics (FVC -4.3% afternoon one day lag, -4.9% afternoon two day lag, -3.6% morning one day lag) and children (FVC -3.2% same morning, PEF -11.9% same morning, PEF -4.6% morning one day lag). In the group of elderly, however, there were also some significant FVC and PEF increments. Ozone responders were found more often in the groups of asthmatics and children (21% resp. 18%) compared with elderly and athletes (both 5%). The results suggest that children and asthmatics have a higher risk of being ozone sensitive showing more ozone related acute lung function decrements than other population groups."

Heart rate averaged 161 beats/min during training, and 176 beats/min during races. Exercise duration averaged 75 min. Ozone concentrations during exercise were obtained from the nearest stations of the National Monitoring Network. The difference between pre- and postexercise lung function values was related to these ozone concentrations. Ozone concentrations were low on most occasions with an average of 87 micrograms/m3 and a maximum of 195 micrograms/m3. The difference between pre- and postexercise lung function was found to be negatively related to the ozone concentration during exercise. When all observations obtained at ozone concentrations higher than 120 micrograms/m3 were removed from the analysis, the relationship with ozone was still significant. The data also suggested that effects of ozone on lung function were stronger in midsummer than in the late summer. The difference between pre- and postexercise acute symptoms was positively related to ozone, for shortness of breath, chest tightness, and wheeze. Cough and eye irritation were not related to ozone. These results indicate that in healthy young men vigorously exercising outdoors, ozone is related to lung function changes and acute respiratory symptom changes at low levels of exposure."

Ozone and particulates were monitored at an adjacent government station, in the schoolyard, and under the tarp. Subjects were selected to oversample children with chronic respiratory symptoms, although children with active asthma under regular medication or FEV1 < 80% predicted were excluded. Of the participants, 21 had chronic cough, chronic phlegm, or ever wheeze with colds or apart from colds. Children performed two cycles of treadmill exercise (15 min) and rest (15 min) for a total of 1 h of intermittent exercise. Most subjects attained the target minute ventilation of 35 L/min/m2. Subjects exercised alternately during low ozone hours(8:00-10:00 A.M.) and during peak O3 hours (12:00-2:00 P.M.), to assure a range of exposures. On 85%  of exercise days, the maximum daily 1-h average for ambient O3 exceeded the Mexican guide-line of 110 parts per billion (ppb). O3 exposure during the hour of exercise was divided into quintiles, and the response was adjusted for repeated measures, subject having a cold, and prior outdoor exercise. Ambient O3 in the fifth quintile (mean = 229 ppb) was associated with a percentage change in FVC (-1.43% +/- 0.70), FEV1 (-2.85% +/- 0.79), FEF25-75% (-6.32% +/- 1.87) and FEV1/FVC (-1.41% +/- 0.46).The decrements in lung function observed are comparable to those previously reported in children and young adults exercised in exposure chambers with acute but not chronic O3 exposure.

The difference of PEF after and before training (?PEF) and the PEF after training were used as dependent variables. The ozone concentration during the training and the 1-h maximum ozone concentration of the same and the previous day were used as independent variables. The highest observed 1-h maximum ozone concentration was 236 ?g/m3. ?PEF was unrelated to the ambient ozone concentration during training. Peak flow measured after the training was positively correlated with ambient temperature. The high correlation between ozone and temperature prevented the evaluation of effects of the maximum ozone concentration of the same day on PEF after training. A small negative association of borderline statistical significance between PEF after training and previous-day maximum ozone was observed."

The intention was to obtain an equal distribution of measuring days with elevated and low ozone concentrations, respectively, for each subject. On average the ozone concentrations reached 0.070 ppm on ""ozone days"" [maximum concentration 0.112 ppm for clerks (outdoors), 0.100 ppm for senior citizens, 0.091 for juvenile asthmatics, 0.086 ppm for athletes, and 0.077 ppm for forestry workers] and 0.028 ppm on ""control days"" (minimum 0.001 ppm). The results show no relevant ozone effect for the group with the lowest ventilation rate (senior citizens) and only marginal reductions of respiratory flows and volumes for athletes. Pulmonary decrements of juvenile asthmatics on ozone days were small but larger than those documented in the literature for healthy children. Forestry workers and clerks had significantly higher airway resistances on ozone days, although having been exposed to the lowest ozone concentrations of all groups. Thus, on days with moderately elevated levels of ozone in the environment it is assumed that ozone itself has a minor influence on pulmonary responses compared to that of other constituents of the air in certain locations like in forests or indoors on these days. These could be reaction products of ozone with motor tool exhausts in the case of forestry workers or substances originating from ozone deposition on the surfaces of the offices."

The daily exposure of each mail carrier to O3, particulate matter < 10 microm in aerodynamic diameter (PM10), and nitrogen dioxide was estimated by one air monitoring station in the center of the mail carrier's delivery area. Hourly concentrations of air pollutants during their exposure periods were 6-96 ppb for O3, 11-249 microg/m3 for PM10, and 14-92 ppb for NO2. Linear mixed-effects models were used to estimate the association between air pollution exposures and PEFR after adjusting for subject's sex, age, and disease status and for temperature and humidity. We found that night PEFR and the deviation in night PEFR were significantly decreased in association with 8-hr O3 exposures with a lag 0-2 days and by daily maximum O3 exposures with a lag of 0-1 day in our multipollutant models. By contrast, neither PM10 nor NO2 was associated with a PEFR reduction. Daily 8-hr mean concentrations of O3 had greater reduction effects on PEFR than did daily maximum concentrations. For a 10-ppb increase in the 8-hr average O3 concentration, the night PEFR was decreased by 0.54% for a 0-day lag, 0.69% for a 1-day lag, and 0.52% for a 2-day lag.

Concentrations of acid aerosols and fine particulates, potential confounders of ozone effects, were very low. In individual regressions of evening FEV1 and FVC on maximum daily ozone concentration, 47 of 53 workers with valid data (46 of 53 for FVC) had negative slopes. The average slopes (weighted by the inverse SE of the regression coefficients) were -3.3 and -4.7 ml for FEV1 and FVC, respectively, for each ppb increase in ozone (p < 0.001). Following correction for an individual's mean lung function level, date, and temperature, regression of either the afternoon or the daily change (afternoon-morning) corrected for the morning measurement of FEV1 and FVC on ozone showed similar magnitudes of effect. These associations were still apparent on the following morning, suggesting a persistent ozone effect.

The former studies, focusing on the pulmonary effects of O3 and associated pollutants on children under natural conditions of exposure, are potentially of great importance to understanding the public health impact of ambient O3. However, a thorough assessment of the results of these studies has been hampered by differences in the analysis and reporting of data across the various studies. We obtained data sets from six summer camp studies carried out by three separate investigative groups, including two New Jersey studies performed by New York University, two studies in Ontario carried out by Health and Welfare Canada, and two studies in southern California. The data consisted of sequential, daily measurements of forced expiratory volume in 1 sec (FEV1), peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR), and 1-hr O3 concentration in the hour preceding lung function measurements for each child. We analyzed the relationships between lung  function  and  O3  using  linear  regression models that fit subject-specific intercepts and a single, pooled O3 slope. These models were fit for each of the six studies separately and for all studies combined. All of the study-specific slopes of FEV1 on O3 were negative (i.e., increased O3 associated with decreased FEV1); five of six were statistically significant. Analysis of the combined six-study data set yielded a slope of -0.50 ml FEV1/ppb O3 (p<0.0001). Addition of time-trend variables to the combined-data analysis diminished, but did not eliminate, the FEV1-O3 relationship. Study-specific slopes for PEFR on O3 were more variable. Combined over studies, no significant relationship was observed between PEFR and O3. However, this negative finding appeared to be partially confounded by time trends in PEFR. The results of this reanalysis provide  strong evidence that children exposed to O3 under natural conditions experience decreases in FEV1 of the kind demonstrated in laboratory studies, and raise concern that other acute respiratory effects observed in those studies (e.g., pulmonary inflammation) may also occur in young people exposed to ambient O3."

METHODS: Enrolled children recorded peak expiratory flow rates (PEFR) twice daily. We obtained air pollution, meteorological and pollen data. In all, 125 children remained in the final analysis. RESULTS: We found a significant negative association between daily mean deviation in PEFR and same-day mean daytime ozone concentration (beta-coefficient = 0.88; P = 0.04) after adjusting for co-pollutants, time trend, meteorological variables, pollen count and Alternaria count. The association was stronger in a subgroup of children with bronchial hyperreactivity and a doctor diagnosis of asthma (beta-coefficient = -2.61; P = 0.001). There was no significant association between PEFR and same-day daily daytime maximum ozone concentration. We also demonstrated a dose-response relationship with mean daytime ozone concentration.

Models considered effect modification by maintenance corticosteroid (CS) use and by the presence of an upper respiratory infection (URI) as recorded in a daily diary among 86 children who participated in six 2-week seasonal assessments from winter 2001 through spring 2002. Participants were predominantly African American from families with low income, and > 75% were categorized as having persistent asthma. In both single-pollutant and two-pollutant models, many regressions demonstrated associations between higher exposure to ambient pollutants and poorer lung function (increased diurnal variability and decreased lowest daily values for forced expiratory volume in 1 sec) among children using CSs but not among those not using CSs, and among children reporting URI symptoms but not among those who did not report URIs. Our findings suggest that levels of air pollutants in Detroit, which are above the current National Ambient Air Quality Standards, adversely affect lung function of susceptible asthmatic children."

A new study was conducted, with the aim of assessing the short-term effects of photo-oxidant and particulate air pollution on childhood asthma during spring and early summer in Paris. Eighty-two medically diagnosed asthmatic children were followed up for 3 months. Outcomes included the incidence and prevalence of asthma attacks, nocturnal cough, supplementary use of beta2-agonists, symptoms of airway irritation, and peak expiratory flow (PEF) value and its variability. The statistical methods controlled for the lack of independence between daily health outcomes, temporal trends and pollen and weather conditions. Black smoke and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) were associated with increases in the occurrence of nocturnal cough and respiratory infections. Ozone (O3) was associated with an increase in the occurrence of asthma attacks and respiratory infections and with changes in lung function, as shown by an increase in PEF variability and a decrease in PEF. Statistically significant interactions were demonstrated between O3 and temperature and between O3 and pollen count for asthma attacks. O3 levels had a greater effect on additional bronchodilator use and on irritations of the eyes, nose and throat on days on which no steroids were used. Particulate matter was associated with eye irritation only. This study showed that, although within international air quality standards, the prevailing levels of photo-oxidant and particulate pollution in spring and early summer had measurable short-term effects on children with mild-to-moderate asthma."

A total of 151 asthmatic children, who were participants in a randomised controlled trial of antioxidant vitamin supplementation in Mexico City, were studied.

Children with asthma in inner-city communities may be particularly vulnerable to adverse effects of air pollution because of their airways disease and exposure to relatively high levels of motor vehicle emissions.

Objective

To investigate the association between fluctuations in outdoor air pollution and asthma morbidity among inner-city children with asthma.

Methods

We analyzed data from 861 children with persistent asthma in 7 US urban communities who performed 2-week periods of twice-daily pulmonary function testing every 6 months for 2 years. Asthma symptom data were collected every 2 months. Daily pollution measurements were obtained from the Aerometric Information Retrieval System. The relationship of lung function and symptoms to fluctuations in pollutant concentrations was examined by using mixed models.

Results

Almost all pollutant concentrations measured were below the National Ambient Air Quality Standards. In single-pollutant models, higher 5-day average concentrations of NO2, sulfur dioxide, and particles smaller than 2.5 ?m were associated with significantly lower pulmonary function. Higher pollutant levels were independently associated with reduced lung function in a 3-pollutant model. Higher concentrations of NO2 and particles smaller than 2.5 ?m were associated with asthma-related missed school days, and higher NO2 concentrations were associated with asthma symptoms.

Conclusion

Among inner-city children with asthma, short-term increases in air pollutant concentrations below the National Ambient Air Quality Standards were associated with adverse respiratory health effects. The associations with NO2 suggest that motor vehicle emissions may be causing excess morbidity in this population."

Air pollution is associated with respiratory symptoms, lung function decrements, and hospitalizations. However, there is little information about the influence of air pollution on lung injury.

Objective
In this study we investigated acute effects of air pollution on pulmonary function and airway oxidative stress and inflammation in asthmatic children.

Methods
We studied 182 children with asthma, 9?14 years of age, for 4 weeks. Daily ambient concentrations of sulfur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide, ozone, and particulate matter ? 2.5 ?m in aerodynamic diameter (PM2.5) were monitored from two stations. Once a week we measured spirometry and fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO), and determined thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) and 8-isoprostane?two oxidative stress markers?and interleukin-6 (IL-6) in breath condensate. We tested associations using mixed-effects regression models, adjusting for confounding variables.

Results
Interquartile-range increases in 3-day average SO2 (5.4 ppb), NO2 (6.8 ppb), and PM2.5 (5.4 ?g/m3) were associated with decreases in forced expiratory flow between 25% and 75% of forced vital capacity, with changes being ?3.1% [95% confidence interval (CI), ?5.8 to ?0.3], ?2.8% (95% CI, ?4.8 to ?0.8), and ?3.0% (95% CI, ?4.7 to ?1.2), respectively. SO2, NO2, and PM2.5 were associated with increases in TBARS, with changes being 36.2% (95% CI, 15.7 to 57.2), 21.8% (95% CI, 8.2 to 36.0), and 24.8% (95% CI, 10.8 to 39.4), respectively. Risk estimates appear to be larger in children not taking corticosteroids than in children taking corticosteroids. O3 (5.3 ppb) was not associated with health end points. FeNO, 8-isoprostane, and IL-6 were not associated with air pollutants.

Conclusion
Air pollution may increase airway oxidative stress and decrease small airway function of asthmatic children. Inhaled corticosteroids may reduce oxidative stress and improve airway function."

An interquartile range (IQR) increase (6.0 ?g?m?3) in the previous 24-h (20:00 h to 20:00 h) mean concentration of fine particulate matter 2.5 ?m in diameter (PM2.5) was associated with a 0.54% (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.06?1.02) decrease in bedtime FEV1 (p = 0.027).

Because multiple studies have reported associations between air pollution and asthma worsening, elevated levels of air pollution are cited as a possible trigger for increased asthma morbidity in urban areas. Few studies have prospectively followed panels of urban children with asthma to determine whether air pollution levels are associated with clinically relevant outcomes such as asthma exacerbations. Objective: To determine the association between levels of ambient air pollutants and asthma exacerbations in urban poor children with moderate to severe asthma. Methods: A school-based panel of children with difficult-to-control disease was followed over a period of 3 consecutive winters in Denver, Colo. The panel consisted of predominantly urban African American children with moderate to severe asthma. Levels of Environmental Protection Agency criteria air pollutants were measured on a daily basis with concurrent monitoring of lung function, bronchodilator use, symptoms, and asthma exacerbations. Results: After controlling for time-varying factors such as upper respiratory infections and meteorologic factors, a weak association was found between ambient carbon monoxide levels and bronchodilator use. Ozone levels were associated with daytime symptoms only. No association was observed between daily air pollution concentrations and daily levels of FEV1, peak flow, nighttime symptom scores, or asthma exacerbations over the 3-year period. Conclusion: Ambient levels of Environmental Protection Agency criteria air pollutants in Denver do not lead to clinically significant asthma worsening in urban children with moderate to severe asthma during winter months when children are primarily indoors."

Children's exposure to PM is likely to involve both combustion-related ambient PM and PM related to a child's activity in various indoor and outdoor microenvironments. Among 19 children with asthma, 9-17 years of age, we examined the relationship of temporal changes in percent predicted forced expiratory volume in 1 sec (FEV1) to personal continuous PM exposure and to 24-hr average gravimetric PM mass measured at home and central sites. Subjects were followed for 2 weeks during either the fall of 1999 or the spring of 2000, in a southern California region affected by transported air pollution. FEV1 was measured by subjects in the morning, afternoon, and evening. Exposure measurements included continuous PM using a passive nephelometer carried by subjects; indoor, outdoor home, and central-site 24-hr gravimetric PM2.5 (PM of aerodynamic diameter < 2.5 Am) and PM10; and central-site hourly PM10, nitrogen dioxide, and ozone. Data were analyzed with linear mixed models controlling for within-subject autocorrelation, FEV1 maneuver time, and exposure period. We found inverse associations of FEV1 with increasing PM exposure during the 24 hr before the FEV1 maneuver and with increasing multiday PM averages. Deficits in percent predicted FEV1 (95% confidence interval) for given PM interquartile ranges measured during the preceding 24-hr were as follows: 128 Ag/m3 1-hr maximum personal PM, -6.0% (-10.5 to -1.4); 30 Ag/m3 24-hr average personal PM, -5.9% (-10.8 to -1.0); 6.7 Ag/m3 indoor home PM2.5, -1.6% (-2.8 to -0.4); 16 Ag/m3 indoor home PM10, -2.1% (-3.7 to -0.4); 7.1 Ag/m3 outdoor home PM2.5, -1.1% (-2.4 to 0.1); and 7.5 Ag/m3 central-site PM2.5, -0.7% (-1.9 to 0.4). Stronger associations were found for multiday moving averages of PM for both personal and stationary-site PM. Stronger associations with personal PM were found in boys allergic to indoor allergens.

However, it is unknown whether this phenomenon is explained by an air pollution-mediated increase in respiratory symptom severity or whether air pollutants decrease the efficacy of short-acting ?-agonists (SABAs).

Methods:  We examined the relationship between the percentage change in FEV1 after SABA use with outdoor air pollution exposure in 85 children with asthma who were 7 to 12 years of age. Outdoor air pollution exposure was determined by measuring nitrogen dioxide (NO2), ozone (O3), and fine particulate matter (ie, particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter < 2.5 ?m [PM2.5]) levels. These measurements were obtained from the Mexico City Automated Monitoring Network from network sites located within a 5-km radius of each child's home and school.

Results:  We found that a same-day interquartile increase of 10 parts per billion (ppb) in NO2 concentration was associated with a reduced response of FEV1 to SABA therapy (?15%; 95% CI, ?29 to ?0.5). This association was also significant when considering NO2 levels in each of the preceding 3 days. An interquartile O3 increase (16 ppb) in the preceding fifth day was associated with a reduced response to SABA (?11%; 95% CI, ?23 to ?1); an interquartile PM2.5 increase (14 ?g/m3) was not associated with any significant reductions in the response to SABA therapy. These associations were not observed in children receiving therapy with inhaled corticosteroids.

Conclusions:  Our results suggest that recent exposure to NO2 and possibly O3 may reduce the response to SABAs in producing bronchodilation in children with asthma.

Several studies suggest that dietary intake of fruits and vegetables might modify the adverse effect of air pollutants. METHODS: A total of 158 asthmatic children recruited at the Children's Hospital of Mexico and 50 non-asthmatic children were followed for 22 weeks. Pulmonary function was measured and nasal lavage collected and analyzed every 2 weeks. Dietary intake was evaluated using a 108-item food frequency questionnaire and a fruit and vegetable index (FVI) and a Mediterranean diet index (MDI) were constructed. The impact of these indices on lung function and interleukin-8 (IL-8) and their interaction with air pollutants were determined using mixed regression models with random intercept and random slope. RESULTS: FVI was inversely related to IL-8 levels in nasal lavage (p < 0.02) with a significant inverse trend (test for trend p < 0.001), MDI was positively related to lung function (p < 0.05), and children in the highest category of MDI had a higher FEV1 (test for trend p < 0.12) and FVC (test for trend p < 0.06) than children in the lowest category. A significant interaction was observed between FVI and ozone for FEV1 and FVC as was with MDI and ozone for FVC. No effect of diet was observed among healthy children. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that fruit and vegetable intake and close adherence to the Mediterranean diet have a beneficial effect on inflammatory response and lung function in asthmatic children living in Mexico City."

We examined the effects of outdoor air pollutants, fungi, and pollen on asthma. Twenty-two asthmatics ages 9-46 years were followed for 8 weeks (9 May-3 July 1994) in a semirural Southern California community around the air inversion base elevation (1,200 ft). Daily diary responses included asthma symptom severity (6 levels), morning and evening peak expiratory flow rates (PEFR), and as-needed beta-agonist inhaler use. Exposures included 24-hr outdoor concentrations of fungi, pollen, and particulate matter with a diameter < 10 microns (PM10; maximum = 51 micrograms/m3) and 12-hour day-time personal ozone (O3) measurements (90th percentile = 38 ppb). Random effects longitudinal regression models controlled for autocorrelation and weather. Higher temperatures were strongly protective, probably due to air conditioning use and diminished indoor allergens during hot, dry periods. Controlling for weather, total fungal spore concentrations were associated with all outcomes: per minimum to 90th percentile increase of nearly 4,000 spores/m3, asthma symptom scores increased 0.36 (95% CI, 0.16-0.56), inhaler use increased 0.33 puffs (95% CI, -0.02-0.69), and evening PEFR decreased 12.1 l/min (95% CI, -1.8-22.3). These associations were greatly enhanced by examining certain fungal types (e.g., Alternaria, basidiospores, and hyphal fragments) and stratifying on 16 asthmatics allergic to tested deuteromycete fungi. There were no significant associations to low levels of pollen or O3, but inhaler use was associated with PM10 (0.15 inhaler puffs/10 micrograms/m3; p < 0.02). These findings suggest that exposure to fungal spores can adversely effect the daily respiratory status of some asthmatics."

Daily outdoor concentrations of pollutants and aeroallergens were measured, and indoor levels of bioaerosols were measured on several occasions in each participant's home. Ozone was associated with increased morning and evening symptom scores and decreased evening PEFR, and these associations remained significant with adjustment for weather and aeroallergens.

Previous studies have demonstrated associations of high ozone levels with increased epidemiologic as well as lung function measures of asthma activity. Objectives. In an observational study during the summer months, we hypothesized that higher ambient ozone levels are associated with more frequent symptoms, higher airway and systemic inflammation, as well as worse lung function in asthmatics as compared with non-asthmatic individuals. Methods. Thirty-eight asthmatics and thirteen healthy control subjects residing in metropolitan Atlanta were enrolled during peak ozone season. Medical histories, quality-of-life questionnaires, spirometry, serum immunoglobulin (IgE), peripheral eosinophil counts, and exhaled nitric oxide (NO) were obtained during study visits. Personal ozone exposures over the 2 days before presentation were estimated based on location and activity surveys. Main results. Upper airway symptoms were more frequent in asthmatics. Higher levels of ozone were associated with worse airflow obstruction, lower quality of life scores, greater eosinophilia, and higher exhaled NO levels in asthmatics. Finally, both asthmatics and non-asthmatics with allergies showed associations between air quality and airway inflammation. Conclusions: In adults with asthma but not controls studied during peak ozone season, increasing ozone exposure predicted lower lung function and increased biomarkers of respiratory and systemic inflammation. These associations were enhanced in atopic participants, both with and without asthma. Importantly, the study findings were noted while atmospheric ozone levels were predominantly within the current and revised national air quality standards."

We conducted a time-series panel study of subjects with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), asthma, and ischemic heart disease (IHD) to evaluate whether daily levels of air pollutants have a measurable impact on the lung function of adult subjects with pre-existing lung or heart diseases.

METHODS: Twenty-nine patients with COPD, asthma, or IHD underwent repeated lung function tests by supervised spirometry in two one-month surveys. Daily samples of coarse (PM10-2.5) and fine (PM2.5) particulate matter were collected by means of dichotomous samplers, and the dust was gravimetrically analyzed. The particulate content of selected metals (cadmium, chrome, iron, nickel, lead, platinum, vanadium, and zinc) was determined by atomic absorption spectrometry. Ambient concentrations of nitrogen dioxide (NO2), carbon monoxide (CO), ozone (O3), and sulphur dioxide (SO2) were obtained from the regional air-quality monitoring network. The relationships between concentrations of air pollutants and lung function parameters were analyzed by generalized estimating equations (GEE) for panel data.

RESULTS: Decrements in lung function indices (FVC and/or FEV1) associated with increasing concentrations of PM2.5, NO2 and some metals (especially zinc and iron) were observed in COPD cases. Among the asthmatics, NO2 was associated with a decrease in FEV1. No association between average ambient concentrations of any air pollutant and lung function was observed among IHD cases.

CONCLUSION: This study suggests that the short-term negative impact of exposure to air pollutants on respiratory volume and flow is limited to individuals with already impaired respiratory function. The fine fraction of ambient PM seems responsible for the observed effects among COPD cases, with zinc and iron having a potential role via oxidative stress. The respiratory function of the relatively young and mild asthmatics included in this study seems to worsen when ambient levels of NO2 increase."

However, the evidence linking these particles to adverse effects on the airways of asthmatic individuals is limited. The objective of this study was to investigate the possible adverse effects of Asian dust events on the respiratory functions and symptoms of subjects with bronchial asthma. 

METHODOLOGY: From March to June 2002, individuals were enrolled who had been diagnosed as having asthma by bronchial challenge or by their bronchodilator response. The patients were divided into three groups according to asthma severity: mild, moderate and severe. Patients with other major disease states were excluded. Patients completed twice-daily diaries monitoring PEF, respiratory symptoms, and daily activities. The daily and hourly mean levels of particulate matter <10 microm in diameter (PM(10)), as well as nitrogen dioxide (NO(2)), sulphur dioxide (SO(2)), ozone (O(3)) and carbon monoxide (CO) were measured at 10 monitoring sites in Incheon, Korea. 

RESULTS: Dust events occurred 14 times during the study period. On dusty days there were increased levels of PM(10), decreased levels of NO(2) and SO(2), and no change in the CO levels, compared to the levels on control days. An increase in PM(10) concentration was associated with increases in PEF variability of >20% (P<0.05), more night-time symptoms (P<0.05), and a decrease in the mean PEF (P<0.05), calculated by longitudinal data analysis. In contrast, there was no association between the PM(10) levels and bronchodilator inhaler use or daytime respiratory symptoms. Using a general additive Poisson regression model, a borderline association was noted between PM(10) and respiratory symptoms, with a relative risk of 1.05 (95% confidence interval (CI), 0.99--1.17). There was no association between the PM(10) concentrations and PEF measurements, with PEF variability of >20% between the morning and evening values and a relative risk of 1.05 (95% CI, 0.89--1.24) in all subjects. 

CONCLUSIONS: This study provides evidence that Asian dust events are impacting on the respiratory symptoms of subjects with bronchial asthma, and ambient air pollution, particularly elevated PM(10), might be one of the aggravating factors."

Spirometry was performed once for each sampled child. We also obtained the status of indoor air pollution and chronic respiratory disease history by using a structured questionnaire. Multivariate linear model analysis was used to evaluate pulmonary function effects of each pollutant in addition to determinants of indoor air pollution and meteorologic conditions. We found a significantly negative association of peak O3 concentration on the day before spirometry with individual forced vital capacity and forced expiratory volume in 1 sec. The decrease in children's lung function can occur at peak hourly O3 concentrations < 80 ppb. The slope of lung function decrease for Taiwanese children is approximately 1 mL/ppb for peak hourly O3 exposure."

We measured peak expiratory flow in the morning on the children's arrival at school and in the afternoon before their departure from school. Separately for morning and afternoon, we normalized each child's daily measurement of peak flow by subtracting his or her mean peak flow from the daily measurement. Child-specific deviations were averaged to obtain a morning and afternoon mean deviation (APEF) for each day. Mean 24-hour O3 level was 52 parts per billion (ppb; maximum 103 ppb); mean 24-hour PM2.5 and PM10 were 30 microg/m3 (maximum 69 microg/m3) and 49 microg/m3 (maximum 87 microg/m3), respectively. We adjusted moving average and polynomial distributed lag multiple regression analyses of APEF vs pollution for minimum daily temperature, trend, and season. We examined effects of PM2.5, PM10, and O3, on deltaPEF separately and in joint models. The models indicated a role for both particles and O3 in the reduction of peak expiratory flow, with shorter lags between exposure and reduction in peak expiratory flow for O3 than for particle exposure (0-4 vs 4-7 days). The joint effect of 7 days of exposure to the interquartile range of PM2.5 (17 microg/m3) and O3 (25 ppb) predicted a 7.1% (95% confidence interval = 11.0-3.9) reduction in morning peak expiratory flow. Pollutant exposure also predicted higher rates of phlegm; colinearity between pollutants limited the potential to distinguish the relative contribution of individual pollutants. In an area with chronically high ambient O3 levels, school children responded with reduced lung function to both O3 and particulate exposures within the previous 1 to 2 weeks."

However, data from the UK are sparse and the contribution of different particulate fractions and acid species, together with the identification of those individuals most at risk, are not clear. 
Methods: One hundred and sixty two 9 year old children were enrolled from two inner city locations and recorded daily symptoms and twice daily peak expiratory flow (PEF) over 8 week periods in the winter and summer. Their results were analysed with daily pollutant levels at appropriate lags using regression models which corrected for trends, weather, pollen, and autocorrelation. Results: Pollutant levels were generally low, especially in the summer. Multiple statistically significant associations were noted between health outcomes and pollutant concentrations, but no consistent patterns in identified effects were apparent between pollutants, lags, direction of observed effect, or location. There was no evidence to suggest that subgroups with atopy or pre-existing wheeze are more sensitive to pollutant effects. Conclusion: These data do not suggest that adverse health outcomes are associated with daily variation in health effects. No evidence was found to indicate that particulates or individual acid and anion species are more closely related to adverse health outcomes than other pollutants."

Ozone half-hour mean concentrations were measured continuously and pulmonary function was tested in each child on four occasions (April, June, August, and September). To obtain an average short-term ozone effect, we first analyzed the data from the four time points separately and then constructed a model that included all information. During the study period the median (5th to 95th percentile) of all half-hour values of the ozone concentration was 101 micrograms/m3 or 50.6 ppb (45-179 micrograms/m3 or 22.5-89.8 ppb) in Freudenstadt and 64 micrograms/m3 or 32.1 ppb (1 to 140 micrograms/m3 or 0.5-70.1 ppb) in Villingen. To assess the effects of an individual ozone exposure we related the highest ozone concentration in the respective 24 hours before lung function testing to the results of the subconcentration in the respective 24 hours before lung function testing to the results of the subsequent pulmonary function tests. In the lung function test following the highest ozone exposure, the results of our cross-sectional linear regression analysis showed a significant negative correlation (P = 0.0181) between ozone exposure and forced vital capacity (FVC). In the longitudinal linear regression model we observed a negative statistical correlation between ozone exposure and lung function for the subpopulation living in the town with the high ozone levels (Freudenstadt). The association was more pronounced in boys than girls. For the children in Freudenstadt the decrement of FVC was -12.31 ml/10 micrograms/m3 ozone and the decrease in the forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) was -11.29 ml/10 micrograms/m3 ozone."

Studies in the USA have reported adverse effects on lung function among children but no comparable studies have been published in the UK. This study investigates the relationship between daily changes in ambient air pollution and short term variations in lung function in a panel of school children. METHODS: One hundred and fifty four children aged 7-11 attending a primary school adjacent to a major motorway in Surrey, south-east England, were studied. Bellows spirometry was performed daily on 31 schooldays between 6 June and 21 July 1994. Levels of ozone, nitrogen dioxide, and particulates of less than 10 microns in diameter (PM10) were measured continuously at the school and the pollen count was measured six miles away. Relationships between daily changes in forced expiratory volume in 0.75 seconds (FEV0.75), forced vital capacity (FVC), the FEV0.75/FVC ratio and pollutants were analysed using separate autoregressive models for each child. A weighted average of the resulting slopes was then calculated. RESULTS: There was a significant inverse relationship between daily mean PM10 levels lagged one day and FVC, with a reduction in lung function of 1% (95% CI 0.3% to 2%) across the whole range of PM10 levels (20-150 micrograms/m3). The effect on FEV0.75 was similar (-0.5%) but was not significant when weighted by 1/SE2 (95% CI -1.2% to 0.2%). There was no effect of PM10 levels on the FEV0.75/FVC ratio. No significant association was seen between FEV0.75, FVC, or the FEV0.75/FVC ratio and either ozone or nitrogen dioxide levels. There was no evidence that wheezy children were more affected than healthy children. Pollen levels on the previous day had no effect on lung function and did not change the air pollution results. CONCLUSIONS: There is a very small, but statistically significant, adverse effect of airborne respirable particulate matter, measured as PM10, on lung function in this study group. There is no evidence for an inverse association of lung function with levels of ozone or NO2 measured on the previous day."

RESULTS: A 15 ppb increase in O(3) during the previous 48 h was associated with a 1.25% decrease in FEV(1) (95% CI: -1.96% to -0.54%). This estimated effect was worsened with either the presence of a long (GT)n repeat in HMOX1 (-1.38%, 95% CI: -2.11% to -0.65%) or the presence of an allele coding for Val105 in GSTP1 (-1.69%, 95% CI: -2.63% to -0.75%). A stronger estimated effect of O(3) on FEV(1) was found in subjects carrying both the GSTP1 105Val variant and the HMOX1 long (GT)n repeat (-1.94%, 95% CI: -2.89% to -0.98%). Similar associations were also found between FVC and O(3) exposure. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that O(3) has an acute effect on lung function in the elderly, and the effects may be modified by the presence of specific polymorphisms in antioxidant genes."

We investigated whether obesity and airways hyperresponsiveness (AHR) modify the acute effects of ozone on lung function in the elderly. METHODS: We studied 904 elderly men from the Normative Aging Study whose lung function (FVC, FEV1) was measured approximately every 3 years from 1995 to 2005. We defined obesity as a body mass index of at least 30 kg/m2. Using a standardized methacholine challenge test, we defined AHR as a FEV1 decline of 20% after inhalation of a cumulative dosage of 0 to 8.58 micromol of methacholine. Ambient ozone in the Greater Boston area was measured continuously. We estimated effects using mixed linear models, adjusting for known confounders. RESULTS: An increase in ozone of 15 parts per billion during the previous 48 h was associated with a greater decline in FEV1 in the obese (-2.07%; 95% confidence interval [CI], -3.25 to -0.89%) than in the nonobese (-0.96%; 95% CI, -1.70 to - 0.20%). The same exposure was also associated with a greater decline in FEV1 for those with AHR (-3.07%; 95% CI, -4.75 to -1.36%) compared to those without AHR (-1.32%; 95% CI, -2.06 to -0.57%). A three-way interaction trend test demonstrated a multiplicative effect of those two risk factors (p < 0.001). We found similar associations for FVC. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that both obesity and AHR modify the acute effect of ozone on lung function in the elderly, with evidence of interaction between AHR and obesity that causes a greater than additive effect."

This short-term effect has only been studied for up to a few days postexposure. Our objective was to analyze the effect of air pollution on spirometric parameters in varying lag times of up to 1 week from the time of exposure. METHODS: Healthy subjects, never smokers, who were participants in the Tel Aviv Sourasky Medical Center Inflammation Survey held between 2002 and 2007, were included if residing within an 11-km range to the nearest air pollution monitoring station. Linear regression models were applied to each lung function variable [first second of exhalation (FEV(1)), forced vital capacity (FVC), FEV(1)/FVC] against air pollutant variables (particulate matter under 10 microns in diameter, sulfur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide, carbon monoxide, and ozone) for increasing lag periods of up to 7 days, and they were adjusted for possible confounders that affect air pollution and spirometric measurements. RESULTS: The study population comprised 2380 individuals. We found a statistically significant negative correlation between air pollutants, mainly SO(2), and between FEV(1) and FVC. This effect was significant from days 3 to 6, with a maximal effect noted for the fifth day and for the 7-day average before pulmonary function measurement. No significant change was found for FEV(1)/FVC ratio. CONCLUSIONS: Air pollution has a decremental effect on lung function parameters for up to 6 days after exposure in healthy adults. SO(2) emerged as the most significant air pollutant affecting short-term lung function parameters."

We applied multiple methods of estimating exposure for several air pollutants. We investigated how different methods of estimating exposure may influence health effect estimates in a case study of lung function data, forced expiratory volume in 1s (FEV1), and forced vital capacity (FVC), for 2102 cohort subjects in Ulsan, Korea, for 2003-2007. Measurements from 13 monitors for particulate matter <10?m (PM(10)), ozone, nitrogen dioxide, sulfur dioxide, and carbon monoxide were used to estimate individual-level exposures by averaging across values from all monitors, selecting the value from the nearest monitor, inverse distance weighting, and kriging. We assessed associations between pollutants and lung function in linear regression models, controlling for age, sex, and body mass index. Cross-validation indicated that kriging provided the most accurate estimated exposures. FVC was associated with all air pollutants under all methods of estimating exposure. Only ozone was associated with FEV1. An 11ppb increase in lag-0-2 8-h maximum ozone was associated with a 6.1% (95% confidence interval 5.0, 7.3%) decrease in FVC and a 0.50% (95% confidence interval 0.03, 0.96%) decrease in FEV1, based on kriged exposures. Central health effect estimates were generally higher using exposures based on averaging across all monitors or kriging. Results based on the nearest monitor approach had the lowest variance. Findings suggest that spatial interpolation methods may provide better estimates than monitoring values alone by reflecting the spatial variability of individual-level exposures and generating estimates for locations without monitors."

Our aim was to study the role of neutrophils, and neutrophil-derived serine proteinases in an acute model in patients with asthma. Exposure to ozone induces an acute neutrophilic inflammatory reaction accompanied by an increase in airway hyperresponsiveness. It is thought that these two effects of ozone are linked, and that neutrophil-derived serine proteinases (i.e. elastase) may play a role in the ozone-induced airway hyperresponsiveness. Therefore, we examined the effect of recombinant antileukoprotease (rALP), one of the major serine proteinase inhibitors in the lung, on ozone-induced changes in airway hyperresponsiveness in this model. We observed that 16 h after exposure to ozone, airway hyperresponsiveness to methacholine was increased both following placebo and rALP treatment. There was no significant difference between placebo and rALP treatment (change in area under the dose-response curve to methacholine: 117.3 ? 59.0 vs 193.6 ? 59.6 %fallxDD; p = .12). Moreover, the immediate decrease in FEV1 after ozone exposure was not significantly different between the two groups (placebo: -29.6 ? 6.7%; rALP: -20.9 ? 3.8%; p = .11). In addition, no significant differences were observed in plasma levels of fibrinogen degradation products generated by neutrophil serine proteinases before and after exposure to ozone. We conclude that neutrophil-derived serine proteinases are not important mediators for ozone-induced hyperresponsiveness."

Ozone (O(3) ) and endotoxin are common environmental contaminants that cause asthma exacerbation. These pollutants have similar phenotype response characteristics, including induction of neutrophilic inflammation, changes in airway macrophage immunophenotypes, and ability to enhance response to inhaled allergen. Evoked phenotyping studies of volunteers exposed to O(3) and endotoxin were used to identify the response characteristics of volunteers to these pollutants. New studies support the hypotheses that similar innate immune and oxidant processes modulate response to these agents. These include TLR4 and inflammasome-mediated signaling and cytokine production. Innate immune responses are also impacted by oxidative stress. It is likely that continued discovery of common molecular processes which modulate response to these pollutants will occur. Understanding the pathways that modulate response to pollutants will also allow for discovery of genetic and epigenetic factors that regulate response to these pollutants and determine risk of disease exacerbation. Additionally, defining the mechanisms of response will allow rational selection of interventions to examine. Interventions focused on inhibition of Toll-like receptor 4 and inflammasome represent promising new approaches to preventing pollutant-induced asthma exacerbations. Such interventions include specific inhibitors of innate immunity and antioxidant therapies designed to counter the effects of pollutants on cell signaling."

exposure on rat lung ventilation using hyperpolarized (HP)
3He MRI.
Materials and Methods: A total of 24 Sprague-Dawley rats,
distributed in one control group and four groups exposed to
0.5 ppm ozone concentration for two days or six days,
either continuously (22 hours/day) or alternatingly (12
hours/day). A three-step MRI protocol was designed and
applied to each animal, including: 1) 3He gas distribution
images acquired at inspiratory capacity, 2) measurements
of intrapulmonary 3He diffusion coefficients, and 3) dynamic

Although subjects are exposed to twice as much aerosol at any given concentration during the tidal-breathing method compared to the dosimeter method, they were thought to give equivalent results. 

Objective: To compare the 2-min tidal-breathing and the five-breath dosimeter methacholine challenges. 

Setting: Tertiary care university-based bronchoprovocation laboratory. 

Patients: Forty subjects with currently symptomatic asthma. 

Interventions: The two methacholine tests were done in random order on separate days at the same time of day at 1- to 7-day intervals. 

Results: The dosimeter provocation concentration of methacholine causing a 20% fall in FEV1 (PC20) was almost twice that of the tidal-breathing PC20: 2.4 mg/mL vs 1.3 mg/mL (paired t test, p < 0.00005). The difference was greater in those with mild airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR) [PC20 > 1.0 mg/mL; 3.2-fold] compared to those with moderate AHR PC20 < 1.0 mg/mL; 1.6-fold) [p = 0.04]. Three subjects with mild asthma and mild AHR (tidal-breathing PC20, 1.9 to 4.3 mg/mL) had a nonmeasurable PC20 (> 32 mg/mL) with the dosimeter. 

Conclusions: The tidal-breathing method, which exposes the subject to twice as much aerosol at each concentration, produced approximately twice the response. The total lung capacity maneuvers with breathhold during the dosimeter method may inhibit the response in some patients with asthma."

METHODS: Eleven subjects with allergic asthma and 22 subjects with allergic rhinitis underwent single exposures to filtered air, 125 p.p.b. and 250 p.p.b. ozone, as well as repeated exposures to 125 p.p.b. ozone on four consecutive days. Twenty hours after the (final) exposure, subjects inhaled a single dose of allergen and a sputum induction was performed 6-7 h later. RESULTS: In the subjects with rhinitis, the mean early-phase response of FEV1 and the number of > or = 20% reductions were significantly greater after exposure to 250 or 4 x 125 p.p.b. ozone compared with filtered air. In addition, most of the > or = 15% late-phase responses in FEV1 occurred after exposure to 4 x 125 p.p.b., as well as the strongest effects on sputum parameters. The rise in the number of eosinophils was statistically significant in both groups. Regarding the number of lymphocytes and the concentrations of mast cell tryptase, histamine or LDH, significance was, however, only reached in the asthma group. CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that repeated exposure to ozone, at a peak ambient air level, can enhance both functional and inflammatory responses to inhaled allergen in subjects with pre-existing allergic airway diseases, and that these effects might reach a clinically relevant magnitude."

Nine rat strains were exposed to 0.05 parts per million (ppm) for 4 h and airway responsiveness to intravenous 5-hydroxytryptamine (HT) examined. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) was examined for the presence of inflammatory cells and markers. Lewis, BDII and Long-Evans rats developed AHR 90 min after ozone exposure, whereas Wistar, Sprague-Dawley, Fisher 344, Brown-Norway, BDE and DA rats did not. Baseline airway responsiveness to 5-HT differed significantly between rat strains, but did not correlate with the presence or absence of ozone-induced AHR. No inflammatory cell influx was found in BALF of any rat strain. In Long-Evans rats, AHR lasted up to 12 h after ozone exposure despite the absence of an inflammatory cell influx or increase in lactate dehydrogenase, alkaline phosphatase or total protein in BALF. In conclusion, exposure to an ambient concentration of ozone induced airway hyperresponsiveness without airway inflammation in some highly inbred rat strains. Genetic factors are likely to account for the observed variability in sensitivity of the airways to ozone."

Exposure to ozone therefore, may potentiate the airway response to allergens. We undertook this study to investigate the effect of ozone exposure on airway response to ovalbumin in sensitized guinea pigs and its modulation by dietary supplementation with antioxidant vitamins C and E. METHODS: After in vivo measurements of specific airways conductance (SGaw) and airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR) to inhaled histamine, guinea pigs were sensitized to ovalbumin and divided into three groups: (i) sensitized; (ii) sensitized and exposed daily to ozone; and (iii) sensitized, exposed daily to ozone and given dietary supplementation with vitamin C, 2 mg/kg body wt and E, 7 IU/kg body wt. A control group of nonsensitized animals was included. After 4 wk, AHR was measured again and animals were challenged with inhaled ovalbumin. Changes in SGaw were followed for early and late airway bronchoconstrictive responses. The following measurements were obtained: (i) parameters of oxidative stress--plasma malonaldehyde (MDA) as marker of lipid peroxidation and superoxide anion generation by leukocytes and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) cells; (ii) antioxidant status: red cell superoxide dismutase (SOD); and (iii) glutathione peroxidase (GPx). BAL cytology was studied. RESULTS: Ozone exposure resulted in an increase in AHR and early and late bronchoconstrictive responses after ovalbumin challenge, greater superoxide anion generation in BAL cells, higher plasma MDA levels and decrease in red cell SOD activity. Dietary supplementation with vitamin C and E prevented or ameliorated these responses. INTERPRETATION & CONCLUSIONS: Exposure to ozone at concentrations of 0.12 ppm for 2 h daily for 4 wk enhances the airway response to allergens in sensitized guinea pigs. Dietary supplementation with antioxidant vitamins E and C, affords variable degree of protection against this enhancement."

Although evidence indicates that each of these respiratory insults individually can increase asthma severity in susceptible individuals, we know little about the extent to which exposure to environmental oxidant pollutants can influence the course of respiratory viral infection and its associated inflammation. To investigate the interaction of these two stimuli within their common epithelial cell targets in the upper and lower respiratory tracks, we infected primary human nasal epithelial cells and cells of the BEAS-2B line grown at the air-liquid interface with human rhinovirus type 16 (RV16) and exposed them to NO2 (2.0 ppm) or O3 (0.2 ppm) for 3 hr. Independently, RV16, NO2, and O3 rapidly increased release of the inflammatory cytokine interleukin-8 through oxidant-dependent mechanisms. The combined effect of RV16 and oxidant ranged from 42% to 250% greater than additive for NO2 and from 41% to 67% for O3. We abrogated these effects by treating the cells with the antioxidant N-acetylcysteine. Surface expression of intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1) underwent additive enhancement in response to combined stimulation. These data indicate that oxidant pollutants can amplify the generation of proinflammatory cytokines by RV16-infected cells and suggest that virus-induced inflammation in upper and lower airways may be exacerbated by concurrent exposure to ambient levels of oxidants commonly encountered the indoor and outdoor environments."

OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to confirm the effect of a short-term treatment with oral glucocorticosteroids on O3-induced airway inflammation, detected by induced sputum analysis, and on functional response in glucocorticosteroid-naive subjects. METHODS: A randomized, placebo-controlled study using oral prednisone (25 mg o.d. for 4 days) was carried out. Nine mild persistent asthmatics were exposed for 2 h, on separatedays, to 0.27 ppm O3 and to air in random order, after 4 days of treatment with prednisone (25 mg o.d.) and after 4 days of placebo.Before and after exposure, pulmonary function test was measured; 6 h afterexposure, sputum induction was done. RESULTS: Oral glucorticosteroids did not prevent pulmonary function decrement due to O3. After placebo, the percentage of neutrophils in induced sputum was significantly higher after O3 than after air [52.1 (15.7-77.3) vs. 17.8 (1.7-58.4), p=0.02, O3 vs. air]. This difference was lost after 4 days of treatment with prednisone [35.2% (10-96.2) vs. 30.9% (6.1-75.6), n.s., O3 vs. air]. Neutrophil elastase in sputum supernatant increased after O3 exposure in the sample obtained after placebo, but not after prednisone treatment. CONCLUSIONS: This study confirms that glucocorticosteroids reduce inflammatory airway response, but do not prevent the airway functional impairment after O3 exposure."

While pulmonary function decrements occur almost immediately after ozone exposure, it is not known how quickly the cellular and biochemical changes indicative of inflammation occur in humans. Increased bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid levels of neutrophils (PMNs) and prostaglandins (PGE2) have been reported in humans as early as 3 hr and as late as 18 hr after exposure. The purpose of this study was to determine whether a broad range of inflammatory mediators are elevated in BAL fluid within 1 hr of exposure. We exposed eight healthy volunteers twice: once to 0.4 ppm ozone and once to filtered air. Each exposure lasted for 2 hr during which the subjects underwent intermittent heavy exercise (66 liters/min). BAL was performed 1 hr after the exposure. Ozone induced rapid increases in PMNs, total protein, LDH, -1 antitrypsin, fibronectin, PGE2, thromboxane B2, C3a, tissue factor, and clotting factor VII. In addition, there was a decrease in the recovery of total cells and alveolar macrophages, and decreased ability of alveolar macrophages to phagocytizeCandida albicans.A comparison of these changes with changes observed in an earlier study in which subjects underwent BAL 18 hr after an identical exposure regimen indicates that IL-6 and PGE2levels were higher 1 hr after exposure than 18 hr after exposure, fibronectin and tissue-plasminogen activator levels were higher 18 hr after exposure, and that PMNs, protein, and C3a were present at essentially the same levels at both times. These results indicate that (i) several inflammatory mediators are already elevated 1 hr after exposure; (ii) some mediators achieve their maximal levels in BAL fluid at different times following exposure. These data suggest that the inflammatory response is complex, depending on a cascade of timed events, and that depending on the mediator of interest one must choose an appropriate sampling time."

Biomarkers derive from a variety of sources [bronchiolar lavage (BAL), sputum, exhaled breath, and blood], and have widely variant performance characteristics, and applicability.

Recent findings: Increasing attention is given to biomarkers in exhaled breath, both gaseous (exhaled nitric oxide) and higher molecular weight moieties [in exhaled breath condensate (EBC)]. Current research in EBC analysis has focused on validation, standardization, and technical considerations, whereas research on exhaled nitric oxide (ENO) has moved to testing its predictive value in clinical situations. The use of advanced biostatistical techniques, and combinatorial analyses has led to additional advances in the utility of biomarkers.

Summary: To date, the best validated, and best performing biomarkers for clinical asthma appear to be measures of inflammation in induced sputum, and measures of ENO. Some trials using ENO appear particularly promising for early clinical use. EBC metrics are at present too inchoate for clinical purposes. However, not all important clinical and research questions can be addressed with sputum, EBC, or ENO metrics, leaving an important place for BAL, bronchial biopsy, and perhaps EBC measurements in the research arena.

Because the immune response plays a critical role in each of these diseases, it is important to study the effects of toxicants on the developing immune system. Children's unique susceptibility to environmental toxicants has become an important focus of the field of immunotoxicology and the use of immune biomarkers in molecular epidemiology of children's environmental health is a rapidly expanding field of research. In this review, we discuss how markers of immune status and immunotoxicity are being applied to pediatric studies, with a specific focus on the various methods used to analyze T-helper-1/2 (Th1/Th2) cytokine profiles. Furthermore, we review recent data on the effects of children's environmental exposures to volatile organic compounds, metals, and pesticides on Th1/Th2 cytokine profiles and the associations of Th1/Th2 profiles with adverse health outcomes such as pediatric respiratory diseases, allergies, cancer and diabetes. Although cytokine profiles are increasingly used in children's studies, there is still a need to acquire distribution data for different ages and ethnic groups of healthy children. These data will contribute to the validation and standardization of cytokine biomarkers for future studies. Application of immunological markers in epidemiological studies will improve the understanding of mechanisms that underlie associations between environmental exposures and immune-mediated disorders."

The aim of the present review is to investigate to what extent the issue of defining normal values in healthy adults has been pursued for the biomarkers with clinical value. The current authors reviewed data from literature that specifically addressed the issue of normal values from healthy adults for the four methodologies. Most studies have been performed for BAL (n = 9), sputum (n = 3) and nitric oxide (n = 3). There are no published studies for breath condensate, none of whose markers yet has clinical value. In healthy adult nonsmokers the cut-off points (mean+2sd) for biomarkers with clinical value were as follows. BAL: 16.7% lymphocytes, 2.3% neutrophils and 1.9% eosinophils; sputum: 7.7 x 10(6).mL(-1) total cell count and 2.2% eosinophils; nitric oxide: 20.2 ppb.

A variety of approaches has been used to monitor nasal inflammation objectively to investigate disease processes and to evaluate the effect of therapeutic intervention. These approaches include nasal lavage, nasal cytology, and nasal biopsy, together with the more recently established measurement of nasal nitric oxide (NO) concentration. Although all provide information about nasal mucosal inflammation, the extent of information that can be obtained by each approach, the ease of sampling, and the complexity of sample handling differ. Such considerations influence the choice of approach when measurement of nasal inflammation is to be an objective outcome parameter in a clinical trial. In addition, the choice of approach is also determined by the questions or hypotheses that are to be addressed. Nasal lavage is simple and rapid to perform, is well tolerated, and provides a sample that can provide information about luminal cell recruitment, cell activation, and plasma protein extravasation. Nasal cytology involves sampling and recovering mucosal surface cells. It is also easy to perform and is well tolerated in general, although some find that the procedure causes a transient unpleasant sensation. A differential cell count from the sample provides information about relative cell populations. Both nasal lavage and nasal cytology are readily applicable to clinical trials. Nasal cytology sample handling is easier, but nasal lavage offers the advantage of providing considerably greater information from the sample. Nasal biopsy is a considerably more invasive procedure and requires expertise not only in tissue sampling but also in biopsy processing. Therefore, it is applicable only in specialist centers. However, nasal biopsy is the only sampling technique that directly informs about tissue cellular events, although these may be implied, in part from the other sampling approaches. Tissue specimens can be used to evaluate both protein and gene expression. Measurement of nasal NO involves expensive equipment but provides an instantaneous result, unlike the other approaches, all of which require sample processing and analysis. Recommendations for standardization of measurement have been made, and measures are considered in part to reflect allergic inflammation within the nasal mucosa. The limitations of nasal NO are that it reflects only a certain aspect of allergic mucosal inflammation, and that because a proportion of nasally measured NO is derived from the sinuses under normal circumstances, nasal NO is not specific for nasal disease. The high contribution from the sinus mucosa limits the discriminatory ability of nasal NO to reflect nasal tissue-specific alterations. The incorporation of measures of nasal inflammation in clinical trials has distinguished anti-inflammatory therapy from symptomatic therapy and has the potential to provide information about the efficacy of novel therapies for allergic rhinitis."

These assays have provided evidence of airway and lung redox deviation, acid-base status, and degree and type of inflammation in acute and chronic asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, adult respiratory distress syndrome, occupational diseases, and cystic fibrosis. Characterized by uncertain and variable degrees of dilution, EBC does not provide precise assessment of individual solute concentrations within native airway lining fluid. However, it can provide useful information when concentrations differ substantially between health and disease or are based on ratios of solutes found in the sample. Because they can be used to measure the targets of modern therapy, EBC assays are likely to become integral components of future clinical studies, and after further technical work is accomplished, they might be used to diagnose and monitor therapy in individual patients."

Specifically, the patients on triamcinolone decreased the sensitivity to PM10 but increased the sensitivity to NO2. The patients on salmeterol were more vulnerable to both NO2 and PM10.

METHODS: Standard spirometry and collection of EBC and nasal lavage were performed. Environmental monitoring sites were located within 5 km of the children's homes and schools. Data were analyzed by using generalized estimating equations.

RESULTS: A total of 480 samples of malondialdehyde were obtained from 107 patients with asthma, with a median level of 18.7 (interquartile range [IQR], 12.4-28.7) nmol. Ambient particulates less than 2.5 microg/m(3) and ozone levels on the day of sampling were significantly associated with higher malondialdehyde levels.

In nine male amateur runners, cell composition, apoptosis, and inflammatory mediators were measured in induced sputum collected at rest (baseline) and the morning after races held in the fall (21 km), winter (12 km), and summer (10 km). Concentrations of air pollutants were below the alert threshold at all times. Neutrophil differential counts tended to increase after all races (P = 0.055). Apoptosis of neutrophils increased with ozone (P < 0.005) and particulate matter <10 microm (PM10) (P < 0.05) exposure. Bronchial epithelial cell counts were low at all times and weakly correlated with ozone and PM10 concentrations. Apoptotic bronchial epithelial cells increased after all races (P < 0.05). Inflammatory mediators in induced sputum were low at baseline and after the races, and correlated with neutrophil differential counts only at rest. In conclusion, apoptosis of airway cells in runners appears to be affected by both exercise and environmental conditions. Apoptosis of neutrophils increased with exposure to environmental pollutants while apoptosis of bronchial epithelial cells increased after intense exercise. Since no relationship was observed between neutrophil counts and inflammatory mediators 20 h after races, airways inflammation at this time point appears blunted in healthy runners and little affected by exposure to mild seasonal changes and airborne pollutants."

Methods: A total of 60 elderly subjects contributed up to 12 weekly measurements of fractional exhaled nitric oxide (NO; airway inflammation biomarker), and plasma interleukin-6 (IL-6; systemic inflammation biomarker). PM2.5 mass fractions were PM0.25 (<0.25 ?m) and PM0.25?2.5 (0.25?2.5 ?m). Primary organic markers included PM2.5 primary organic carbon, and PM0.25 polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and hopanes.

Results: Secondary organic markers, PM0.25?2.5, and O3 were positively associated with exhaled NO. Primary organic markers, PM0.25, CO, and NOx were positively associated with IL-6. Reactive oxygen species were associated with both outcomes.

In a human study of the cardiovascular effects of air pollution, we aimed to evaluate the potential association between air pollution levels and the fraction of exhaled nitric oxide (FE(NO)), a non-invasive measure of airway inflammation. 

METHODS: Breath samples were collected weekly between September and December 2000 in a community based group of elderly subjects (median age 70.7 years) in Steubenville, Ohio. The samples were analysed for NO. Air pollution levels were measured concurrently at a central site monitor. 

RESULTS: An increase in the 24 hour average PM(2.5) concentration of 17.7 micro g/m(3) was associated with an increase in FE(NO) of 1.45 ppb (95% CI 0.33 to 2.57) in models adjusted for subject, week of study, day of the week, hour of the day, ambient barometric pressure, temperature, and relative humidity. This represents a change of approximately 15% compared with the mean FE(NO) in the cohort (9.9 ppb). A significant association was also observed for a 24 hour moving average of ambient NO (0.83 ppb increase, 95% CI 0.26 to 1.40). In two-pollutant models, the magnitude and precision of the PM(2.5) effect was not reduced and the ambient NO effect was no longer significant. The associations between FE(NO) and PM(2.5) were significantly higher in subjects with a doctor's diagnosis of COPD (p value for interaction = 0.03). 

CONCLUSIONS: Ambient pollution may lead to airway inflammation as measured by FE(NO). These subclinical inflammatory changes may be an important step in the pathogenesis of the cardiopulmonary effects induced by exposure to air pollution."

The NO derived from airway epithelial cells may be a mechanism for amplifying and perpetuating asthmatic inflammation, through inhibition of T helper 1 (Th1) cells and their production of interferon ? (IFN-?). This would result in an increase in the number of Th2 cells and the cytokines interleukin 4 (IL-4) (which is important for IgE expression) and IL-5 (which plays a critical role in the recruitment of eosinophils into the airways). Although this mechanism may be part of our nonspecific airway defence against parasite invasions, it appears to have been activated inappropriately is asthma. Here, Peter Barnes and Eddy Liew argue that the development of specific iNOS inhibitors may represent a novel therapeutic approach for asthma and other allergic diseases."

Seventy-eight patients with mild/moderate asthma had their inhaled steroid therapy withdrawn until LOC occurred or for a maximum of 6 wk. Sixty (77.9%) developed LOC. There were highly significant correlations between the changes in eNO and symptoms (p < 0.0001), FEV(1) (p < 0.002), sputum eosinophils (p < 0.0002), and saline PD(15) (p < 0.0002), and there were significant differences between LOC and no LOC groups. Both single measurements and changes of eNO (10 ppb, 15 ppb, or an increase of > 60% over baseline) had positive predictive values that ranged from 80 to 90% for predicting and diagnosing LOC. These values were similar to those obtained using sputum eosinophils and saline PD(15) measurements.

Elevated levels of exhaled levels of exhaled NO in asthma and other inflammatory lung diseases lead to many studies examining NO as potential markers of airway inflammation, enabling repeated noninvasive and standardized monitoring of airway inflammation. In airway inflammation, NO is not merely a marker but may have anti-inflammatory and pro-inflammatory effects. Significant correlation has been found between exhaled NO and skin test scores in steroid naive asthmatic patients, allowing to discriminate patients with and without airway responsiveness. Exhaled NO is significantly elevated in acute asthma, or steroid-resistant severe asthma, or when the maintenance dose of inhaled steroids is reduced, and quickly reduced down to the levels in patients with stable asthma after steroid treatment. Exhaled NO has been successfully used to monitor anti-inflammatory treatment with inhaled corticosteroids in asthma. Exhaled NO is extremely sensitive and rapid marker of the dose-dependent effect of steroid treatment, or asthma deterioration, which is increased to any changes in lung function, provocative concentration causing a 20% fall in forced expiratory volume, sputum eosinophilia or asthma symptoms. Exhaled NO is not increased in stable chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), but patients with unstable COPD, or bronchiectasis have high NO levels. Exhaled and nasal NO are diagnostically low in cystic fibrosis and primary pulmonary dyskinesia. Analysis of exhaled air, including nitric oxide, is feasible and could provide a noninvasive method for use in monitoring and management of lung diseases."

The overall objective of this study was to determine the effects of inhalation exposure to environmentally relevant concentrated air particulates (CAPs) on the lungs of ovalbumin (ova) sensitized and challenged Brown Norway rats. Changes in gene expression were compared with lung tissue histopathology, morphometry, and biochemical and cellular parameters in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF). Ova challenge was responsible for the preponderance of gene expression changes, related largely to inflammation. CAPs exposure alone resulted in no significant gene expression changes, but CAPs and ova-exposed rodents exhibited an enhanced effect relative to ova alone with differentially expressed genes primarily related to inflammation and airway remodeling. Gene expression data was consistent with the biochemical and cellular analyses of the BALF, the pulmonary pathology, and morphometric changes when comparing the CAPs-ova group to the air-saline or CAPs-saline group. However, the gene expression data were more sensitive than the BALF cell type and number for assessing the effects of CAPs and ova versus the ova challenge alone. In addition, the gene expression results provided some additional insight into the TGF-beta-mediated molecular processes underlying these changes. The broad-based histopathology and functional genomic analyses demonstrate that exposure to CAPs exacerbates rodents with allergic inflammation induced by an allergen and suggests that asthmatics may be at increased risk for air pollution effects."

One of the well-recognized targets of free radical-induced injury is peroxidation of lipids. Using a variety of approaches, we have found that a series of prostaglandin F2-like compounds are produced in vivo in humans by a non-cyclooxygenase mechanism involving free radical-catalyzed peroxidation of arachidonic acid. Levels of these compounds in normal human plasma and urine range from 5 to 40 pg/ml and 500 to 4000 pg/mg of creatinine, respectively. In rats, their formation was found to increase as much as 200-fold in association with marked free radical-catalyzed lipid peroxidation induced by administration of CCl4 and diquat. To explore whether these prostanoids can exert biological activity, the effects of one of the compounds formed by this mechanism, 8-epi-prostaglandin F2 alpha, was examined in the kidney in the rat. Infusion of 8-epi-prostaglandin F2 alpha into a peripheral vein (5 micrograms/kg per min) or intrarenally (0.5-2.0 micrograms/kg per min) resulted in marked parallel reductions in renal blood flow and glomerular filtration rate. That the formation of these prostanoids is catalyzed by free radicals and that they can exert potent biological activity suggest that these prostanoids may participate as pathophysiological mediators in oxidant injury. Quantification of these compounds may also provide a noninvasive approach to assess oxidant status in humans. That the formation of these prostanoids occurs independent of the catalytic activity of the cyclooxygenase enzyme suggests that there may be limitations at times regarding the reliability of the use of cyclooxygenase inhibitors to assess the role of prostaglandins in certain pathophysiological processes."

DESIGN: The aim of this study was to verify this hypothesis by measuring inflammatory markers in exhaled breath condensate (EBC) collected before and after sputum induction with hypertonic and isotonic saline solution. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We enrolled 10 patients with asthma, 10 patients with COPD, and 7 healthy subjects with no history of lung disease. Levels of interleukin (IL)-6 and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha were measured in EBC by a specific enzyme immunoassay kit. Exhaled pH was measured after deaeration/decarbonation by bubbling with argon (350 mL/min) for 10 min by means of a pH meter. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: Exhaled IL-6 and TNF-alpha concentrations were greater and pH was decreased compared to baseline after hypertonic saline solution inhalation in each group of subjects studied. No changes were observed following isotonic saline solution inhalation. Concentrations of IL-6, TNF-alpha, and pH in EBC correlated. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that hypertonic saline solution inhalation could cause a low-grade inflammation in airways, and levels of inflammatory markers such as IL-6, TNF-alpha, and pH in EBC may be a useful noninvasive way to assess and monitor airway inflammation."

The stability and bioactivities of these species are pH-dependent; however, the pH of the airway during acute asthma has not previously been studied. As with gastric and urinary acidification, asthmatic airway acidification could be expected dramatically to alter the concentrations and bioactivities/cytotoxicities of endogenous nitrogen oxides. Here, we demonstrate that the pH of deaerated exhaled airway vapor condensate is over two log orders lower in patients with acute asthma (5.23 +/- 0.21, n = 22) than in control subjects (7.65 +/- 0.20, n = 19, p < 0.001) and normalizes with corticosteroid therapy. Values are highly reproducible, unaffected by salivary or therapeutic artifact, and identical to samples taken directly from the lower airway. Further, at these low pH values, the endogenous airway compound, nitrite, is converted to nitric oxide (NO) in quantities sufficient largely to account for the concentrations of NO in asthmatic expired air, and eosinophils undergo accelerated necrosis. We speculate that airway pH may be an important determinant of expired NO concentration and airway inflammation, and suggest that regulation of airway pH has a previously unsuspected role in asthma pathophysiology."

The data are for a sample of individuals living near Los Angeles. Our approach differs from earlier ones in that we use a system of equations that allows for correlations across activity types. The empirical results suggest that increased ozone levels have a statistically significant influence on the amount of time that asthmatics spend in one of the activities, even though the examined time period exhibited relatively low ozone levels. Elasticities are estimated to better indicate the sensitivity of humans' activity schedules to pollution levels, and the one ozone effect is shown to be fairly weak. This study adds to the existing literature on the influence of ozone on asthma and asthma sufferers, some of which finds a causal link while other studies do not.

Preliminary results on young rats also suggest that removal of rats from atmospheres containing ozone does not cause reversal of such increases in lung collagen content. To the contrary, recovery periods of up to 6 weeks seem to exacerbate the observed increases in lung collagen content."

The appearance of IL-8 in airway epithelial cells correlated well with neutrophil influx into airway epithelia and lumens. Air-liquid interface cultures of tracheobronchial epithelial cells were exposed to ozone in vitro. We observed a transient increase in IL-8 secretion in culture medium immediately after ozone exposure and a dose-dependent increase in IL-8 secretion and mRNA production. In vitro neutrophil chemotaxis showed a parallel dose and time profile to epithelial cell secretion of IL-8. Treatment with anti-IL-8 neutralizing antibody blocked >80% of the neutrophil chemotaxis in vitro. These results suggest that IL-8 is a key chemokine in acute ozone-induced airway inflammation in primates.

To compare the effects of these 2 cycles, we exposed 2 groups of 7-month-old male monkeys to 0.25 ppm (0.49 mg/m3) of ozone (UV photometric standard) 8 h/day either daily or, in the seasonal model, days of alternate months during a total exposure period of 18 months. This is a longer ozone exposure period than any previously reported. A control group breathed only filtered air. Young monkeys were studied as their lungs are similar to those of man and their lungs, like those of man, grow over a period of several years. Monkeys from the seasonal exposure model, but not those exposed daily, had significantly increased total lung collagen content, chest wall compliance, and inspiratory capacity. All monkeys exposed to ozone had respiratory bronchiolitis with significant increases in related morphometric parameters. The only significant difference between seasonal and daily groups was in the volume fraction of macrophages. Even though the seasonally exposed monkeys were exposed to the same concentration of ozone for only half as many days, they had larger biochemical and physiological alterations and equivalent morphometric changes as those exposed daily. Lung growth was not completely normal in either exposed group. Long-term effects of oxidant air pollutants which have a seasonal occurrence may be more dependent upon the sequence of polluted and clean air than on the total number of days of pollution. Estimations of the risks of human exposure to seasonal air pollutants from effects observed in animals exposed daily may underestimate long-term pulmonary damage."

Lesions were observed in the trachea and lungs of all exposed animals. The extent and severity of damage, but not its nature, varied with exposure concentration. Damage was most severe in respiratory bronchioles and more distal parenchymal regions were unaffected. Major features of the response within respiratory bronchioles were hyperplasia and hypertrophy of nonciliated bronchiolar epithelial cells and intraluminal accumulations of macrophages. Replacement of type 1 epithelium in alveoli by type 2 cells and forms intermediate between types 1 and 2 were also observed. In large conducting airways, damage to ciliated cells was observed but mlcus-producing cells were morphologically unaltered. Two gradients in severity of ozone-induced lesions were appreciable in the trachea and lungs. The most obvious gradient was in respiratory bronchioles where the degree of damage was most severe in proximal locations. A second gradient in severity was noted in conducting airways in which more severe and extensive lesions occurred in the trachea and major bronchi than in small bronchi and terminal bronchioles."

Lung histology revealed cellular inflammation and epithelial necrosis. Gene expression profiling identified oxidative phosphorylation, immune response and cell adhesion pathways altered in response to ozone, with common and unique profiles in lung and blood. Lipocalin 2, CD177, the FK-506 and S100A8 binding proteins and ST-2 represent novel peripheral biomarkers of ozone toxicity.

In the present study, the authors postulated that inhibition of myristoylated alanine-rich C kinase substrate (MARCKS), an 82-kDa protein with multiple biological roles, could inhibit ozone-induced leukocyte trafficking and cytokine secretions. BALB/c mice (n = 5/cohort) were exposed to ozone (100 ppb) or forced air (FA) for 4 hours. MARCKS-inhibiting peptides, MANS, BIO-11000, BIO-11006, or scrambled control peptide RNS, were intratracheally administered prior to ozone exposure. Ozone selectively enhanced bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) levels of killer cells (KCs; 6 +/- 0.9-fold), interleukin-6 (IL-6; 12.7 +/- 1.9-fold), and tumor necrosis factor (TNF; 2.1 +/- 0.5-fold) as compared to cohorts exposed to FA. Additionally, ozone increased BAL neutrophils by 21% +/- 2% with no significant (P > .05) changes in other cell types. MANS, BIO-11000, and BIO-11006 significantly reduced ozone-induced KC secretion by 66% +/- 14%, 47% +/- 15%, and 71.1% +/- 14%, and IL-6 secretion by 69% +/- 12%, 40% +/- 7%, and 86.1% +/- 11%, respectively. Ozone-mediated increases in BAL neutrophils were reduced by MANS (86% +/- 7%) and BIO-11006 (84% +/- 2.5%), but not BIO-11000. These studies identify for the first time the novel potential of MARCKS protein inhibitors in abrogating ozone-induced increases in neutrophils, cytokines, and chemokines in BAL fluid. BIO-11006 is being developed as a treatment for chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder (COPD) and is currently being evaluated in a phase 2 clinical study."

Objective: The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of ozone exposure on antioxidant response in BALB/c mice. Methods: We measured enhanced pause of breathing ( Penh) as a marker of airway obstruction using barometric whole-body plethysmography before and after ozone exposure [ groups ( n = 6): filtered air, 0.12 ppm, 0.5 ppm, 1 ppm, 2 ppm] for 3 h. Antioxidant levels were measured using high-performance liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid and lung tissue homogenates. Results: Malondialdehyde concentrations in lung tissue homogenates were significantly increased in the group exposed to 2-ppm ozone compared to the filtered air group. Uric acid and gamma-tocopherol concentrations in BAL fluid were significantly increased in the ozone exposure group compared to the filtered air group ( p < 0.01). Uric acid concentrations were increased in a concentration-dependent manner according to ozone concentration to which the animals were exposed. Increases in Penh after ozone exposure were significantly higher in an ozone concentration-dependent manner. The proportion of neutrophils in BAL fluid was significantly higher in the group exposed to 2 ppm than in the filtered air and the group exposed to 0.12 ppm ( p < 0.01, respectively). The level of ascorbate correlated with the level of gamma-tocopherol.

Our aim was to assess lung injury induced by 5 and 60 days of intermittent exposure to 0.25 ppm O3 in rats with bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis. Thirty-day-old Sprague Dawley rats were endotracheally instilled with BLM (1 U/100 g body weight) and, 30 days later, exposed to 0.25 ppm 03 (0.25 ppm 4 h per day, 5 days a week). Histopatology controls were instilled with saline and breathing room air. Histopathological evaluation of lungs was done 5 and 60 days after O3 exposure. BLM-induced lung damage did not change after 60 days of intermittent O3 exposure. Five days of O3 exposure increased the mean score of BLM-induced pulmonary inflammation and fibrosis (p=0.06). Frequency of bronchopneumonia increased from 1/7 to 6/6 (p <0.001), suggesting that a short-term exposure to O3 in a previously damaged lung might be a risk factor for developing further lung injury."

In the present study, we genetically determined the role of MT in ozone (O(3))-induced lung inflammation using MT-I/II null (-/-) mice. Subacute (65 h) exposure to O(3) (0.3 ppm) induced lung inflammation and enhanced vascular permeability, which was significantly greater in MT(-/-) than in corresponding wild-type mice. Electron microscopically, O(3) exposure induced vacuolar degeneration of pulmonary endothelial and epithelial cells, and interstitial edema with focal loss of the basement membrane, which was more prominent in MT(-/-) than in wild-type mice. O(3) -induced lung expression of interleukin-6 was significantly greater in MT(-/-) than in wild-type mice; however, lung expression of the chemokines examined was comparable in both genotypes of mice in the presence of O(3). Following O(3) exposure, the formation of oxidative stress-related molecules/adducts, such as heme oxidase-1, inducible nitric oxide synthase, 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine, and nitrotyrosine, in the lung was significantly greater in MT(-/-) than in wild-type mice.

IL-1 mediates its effects through the type I IL-1 receptor (IL-1RI), the only signaling receptor for both IL-1alpha and IL-1beta. The purpose of this study was to determine the role of IL-1RI in pulmonary responses to O(3.) To that end, wild-type, C57BL/6 (IL-1RI(+/+)) mice and IL-1RI-deficient (IL-1RI(-/-)) mice were exposed to O(3) either subacutely (0.3 ppm for 72 h) or acutely (2 ppm for 3 h).

With the exception of IP-10, all outcome indicators were reduced in IL-1RI(-/-) mice. Furthermore, subacute O(3) exposure increased IL-6 mRNA expression in IL-1RI(+/+), but not IL-1RI(-/-) mice. Acute (2 ppm) O(3) exposure increased BALF protein, IL-6, eotaxin, KC, macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)-2, IP-10, monocyte chemotactic protein-1, sTNFR1, neutrophils, and epithelial cells in IL-1RI(+/+) and IL-1RI(-/-) mice. For IL-6, eotaxin, MIP-2, and sTNFR1, there were small but significant reductions of these outcome indicators in IL-1RI(-/-) versus IL-1RI(+/+) mice at 6 hours after exposure, but not at other time points, whereas other outcome indicators were unaffected by IL-1RI deficiency. These results suggest that IL-1RI is required for O(3)-induced pulmonary inflammation during subacute O(3) exposure, but plays a more minor role during acute O(3) exposure. In addition, these results suggest that the induction of IL-6 via IL-1RI may be important in mediating the effects of O(3) during subacute exposure."

Male BALB/c mice were sensitized ip with ovalbumin (Ova) or vehicle only, then exposed once per week for 4 wk via nose-only inhalation (4 h) to the PM(2.5) fraction of DEP (2 mg/m(3)), O(3) (0.5 ppm), DEP and O(3), or filtered air, and then challenged with aerosolized ovalbumin. Ova sensitization in air-exposed mice enhanced pulmonary inflammatory cell infiltration, several indicators of injury in the lung (lactate dehydrogenase, albumin and total protein), and lung resistance (R(L)) and elastance (E(L)) in response to methacholine (MCh) aerosol challenge. DEP exposure did not enhance the Ova-induced increase in pulmonary cell infiltration, indicators of injury, or R(L) and E(L). O(3) exposure enhanced the Ova-induced increase in inflammatory cell infiltration and N-acetylglucosaminidase (NAG) in the lung, but had no effect on R(L) or E(L). DEP co-exposure significantly attenuated the O(3)-induced increase in cell infiltration and indicators of injury; co-exposure had no effect on E(L) relative to air-exposed Ova-sensitized mice. However, only DEP-O(3) co-exposure significantly increased the Ova-induced increase in R(L). Thus, O(3) and DEP co-exposure exacerbated airways hyperresponsiveness, a response that was not associated with parallel increases in pulmonary inflammation and one that may be mediated by a unique mechanism."

Short-term effects of carbon monoxide, nitrogen dioxide, particulate matter less than 10 mum in aerodynamic diameter (PM10), sulfur dioxide, and warm-season ozone were examined in both one-pollutant and two-pollutant models, using lags of up to 2 days. Lags in carbon monoxide and nitrogen dioxide were positively associated with both measures of asthma exacerbation, and the 3-day moving sum of sulfur dioxide levels was marginally related to asthma symptoms. PM10 and ozone were unrelated to exacerbations. The strongest effects tended to be seen with 2-day lags, where a 1-parts-per-million change in carbon monoxide and a 20-parts-per-billion change in nitrogen dioxide were associated with symptom odds ratios of 1.08 (95% confidence interval (CI): 1.02, 1.15) and 1.09 (95% CI: 1.03, 1.15), respectively, and with rate ratios for rescue inhaler use of 1.06 (95% CI: 1.01, 1.10) and 1.05 (95% CI: 1.01, 1.09), respectively.

We obtained daily air pollution (ozone, particulate matter less than 10 Am, and nitrogen dioxide), meteorological, and pollen data. One hundred twenty-five children remained in the final analysis. We used logistic regression models to determine associations between air pollution and respiratory symptoms, asthma medication use, and doctor visits for asthma. There were no associations between ambient ozone concentrations and respiratory symptoms, asthma medication use, and doctor visits for asthma. There was, however, an association between PM10 concentrations and doctor visits for asthma (RR=1.11, 95% CI=1.04-1.19) and between NO2 concentration and wet cough (RR=1.05, 95% CI=1.003-1.10) in single-pollutant models. The associations remained significant in multipollutant models. There was no consistent evidence that children with wheeze, positive histamine challenge, and doctor diagnosis of asthma reacted differently to air pollution from children with wheeze and doctor diagnosis of asthma and children with wheeze only. There were significant associations between PM10 levels and doctor visits for asthma and an association between NO2 levels and the prevalence of wet cough. We were, however, unable to demonstrate that current levels of ambient air pollution in western Sydney have a coherent range of adverse health effects on children with a history of wheezing."

Exposure to various environmental factors, including air pollutants and allergens, has been suggested as a partial explanation of these trends. To examine relations between several air pollutants and asthma exacerbation in African-Americans, we recruited a panel of 138 children in central Los Angeles. We recorded daily data on respiratory symptoms and medication use for 13 weeks and examined these data in conjunction with data on ozone (O3)nitrogen dioxide (NO2), particulate matter (PM10 and PM2.5), meteorological variables, pollens, and molds. Using generalized estimating equations, we found associations between respiratory symptom occurrence and several environmental factors. For example, new episodes of cough were associated with exposure to PM10 (OR = 1.25; 95% CI = 1.12-1.39; inter quartile range [IQR] = 17 micro g/m3, 24-hour average), PM2.5 (OR = 1.10; 95% CI = 1.03-1.18; IQR = 30 micro g/m3, 12-hour average), NO2, and the molds Cladosporium and Alternaria, but not with exposure to O3 or pollen.

Objective: To evaluate our a priori hypothesis that identifiable subgroups of asthmatic children are more likely to wheeze with exposure to ambient air pollution. Methods: A cohort of 315 children with asthma, aged 6 to 11 years, was recruited for longitudinal follow-up in Fresno, CA. During the baseline visit, children were administered a respiratory symptom questionnaire and allergen skin-prick testing. Three times a year, participants completed 14-day panels during which they answered symptom questions twice daily. Ambient air quality data from a central monitoring station were used to assign exposures to the following pollutants: PM2.5, PM10-2.5, elemental carbon (EC), NO2, nitrate (NO3), and O3. Results: For the group as a whole, wheeze was significantly associated with short-term exposures to NO2 (OR=1.10 for 8.7 ppb increase, 95%CI=1.02-1.20) and PM10-2.5 (OR=1.11 for 14.7 microg/m3 increase, 95% CI=1.01-1.22). The association with wheeze was stronger for these two pollutants in children who were skin-test positive to cat or common fungi and in boys with mild intermittent asthma. Conclusion: A pollutant associated with traffic emissions, NO2, and a pollutant with bioactive constituents, PM10-2.5, were associated with increased risk of wheeze in asthmatic children living in Fresno, CA. Children with atopy to cat or common fungi and boys with mild intermittent asthma were the subgroups for which the largest associations were observed."

Polymorphisms of the glutathione-S-transferase (GST) genes are known risk factors for some environmentally-related diseases. In the present study, the hypothesis that polymorphisms in the GSTT1, GSTM1 and GSTP1 genes are associated with atopic and nonatopic asthma was examined. METHODOLOGY: The study population consisted of 103 unrelated healthy individuals and 101 patients with bronchial asthma (64 atopic, 37 nonatopic). Asthma was diagnosed according to the American Thoracic Society statement. Genotyping of polymorphisms in the GSTT1, GSTM1 and GSTP1 genes was performed using real time polymerase chain reaction with a Light Cycler instrument and hybridization probes in combination with the Light Cycler DNA master hybridization probes kit. RESULTS: Patients with atopic asthma (34.4%) had a higher prevalence of the GSTT1 null genotype than the nonatopic asthma patients (13.5%; OR = 3.83; 95% CI, 1.24-11.78). Asthma patients (63.4%) had a higher prevalence of the GSTM1 null genotype than the control group (40.8%; OR = 2.34; 95% CI, 1.31-4.20). Subjects with the GSTP1 homozygous Val/Val genotype had a 3.55-fold increased risk of having atopic asthma compared to nonatopic asthma (OR = 3.55; 95% CI, 1.10-12.56). CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that the GSTT1 and GSTM1 null genotypes and the GSTP1 Val/Val polymorphism may play important roles in asthma pathogenesis. It is possible that intermediate electrophilic metabolites, arising in the first phase of detoxification, are not metabolized by GST enzymes in asthmatic patients and are not excreted. These intermediate metabolites may damage cells and generate oxidative stress, and so contribute to the pathogenesis of asthma."

Objective: We sought to determine whether GSTP1 polymorphism influences susceptibility to asthma induced by toluene diisocyanate (TDI). Methods: The role of GSTP1 was assessed in 131 workers exposed to TDI, 92 with TDI-induced asthma and 39 asymptomatic subjects. The phenotype of the disease was characterized by using detailed clinical history, lung volumes, airway responsiveness to methacholine, and airway responsiveness to TDI. GST genotypes were determined by using PCR-based assays. Results: In patients exposed to TDI for 10 or more years, the frequency of the GSTP1 Val/Val genotype was lower in subjects who had asthma (odds ratio, 0.23; 95% confidence interval, 0.05-1.13; P = .074). Similarly, the frequency of this genotype was significantly lower in subjects with evidence of moderate-to-severe airway hyperresponsiveness to methacholine compared with the frequency in subjects with normal or mild hyperresponsiveness (P = .033). Conclusion: These data suggest that homozygosity for the GSTP1*Val allele confers protection against TDI-induced asthma and airway hyperresponsiveness. This view is supported by the finding that the protective effect increases in proportion to the duration of exposure to TDI."

We previously showed that alleles of GSTP1 that encode the Ile105-->Val105 substitution are associated with the asthma phenotypes of atopy and bronchial hyperresponsiveness (BHR). However, a further polymorphic site (Ala114-->Val114) has been identified that results in the following alleles: GSTP1*A (wild-type Ile105-->Ala114), GSTP1*B (Val105-->Ala114), GSTP1*C (Val105-->Val114) and GSTP1*D (Ile105-->Val114). METHODS: Because full identification of GSTP1 alleles may identify stronger links with asthma phenotypes, we describe an amplification refractory mutation system (ARMS) assay that allows identification of all genotypes. We explored whether the GSTP1 substitutions influence susceptibility to asthma, atopy and BHR. RESULTS: Among 191 atopic nonasthmatic, atopic asthmatic and nonatopic nonasthmatic individuals, none had the BD, CD, or DD genotypes. GSTP1 BC was significantly associated with reduced risk for atopy (P = 0.031). Compared with AA, trend test analysis identified a significant decrease in the frequency of GSTP1 BC with increasing severity of BHR (P = 0.031). Similarly, the frequency of GSTP1 AA increased with increasing BHR. CONCLUSION: These data suggest that GSTP1*B and possibly GSTP1*C are protective against asthma and related phenotypes."

To examine acute effects of air pollution on absence rates, we fitted a two-stage time-series model to the absence count data that included distributed lag effects of exposure adjusted for long-term pollutant levels. Short-term change in O3, but not NO2 or PM10, was associated with a substantial increase in school absences from both upper and lower respiratory illness.

Upon arising and before retiring, each child recorded the time, three PEFR measurements, and the presence of cold, cough, or wheeze symptoms. Ambient air pollution, including particle-strong acidity, was measured separately during the day (8 a.m. to 8 p.m.) and at night. Each child's maximum PEFR for each session was expressed as the deviation from his or her mean PEFR over the study and adjusted to a standard of 300 liters/minute. The session-specific average deviation was then calculated across all of the children. A second-order autoregressive model for PEFR was developed, which included a separate intercept for evening measurements, trend, temperature, and 12-hour average air pollutant concentration weighted by the number of hours each child spent outdoors during the previous 12-hour period. The results are expressed in terms of the interquartile range for each pollutant. A 12-hour exposure to a 125-nmol/m-3 increment in particle-strong acidity was associated with a -2.5 liters/minute deviation in the group mean PEFR (95% confidence interval (CI) -4.2 to -0.8) and with increased cough incidence (odds ratio (OR) = 1.6, 95% CI 1.1 to 2.4). A 30-ppb increment in ozone for 12 hours was associated with a similar deviation in PEFR levels (-2.8, 95% CI -6.7 to 1.1).

DESIGN: Women delivering babies at one of five hospitals in southwestern Virginia between 1994 and 1996 were invited to participate in a cohort study; 780 women enrolled. Ambient air quality data (ozone and particulate matter) were collected at a central monitoring site. PARTICIPANTS: This analysis is of 691 infants followed for approximately 83 days between 10 June and 31 August 1995 and/or 1996; they contributed a total of 52,421 infant-days of follow-up. Mothers were interviewed at enrollment and approximately biweekly to report infants daily symptoms. Repeated measures logistic regression models were run separately for wheeze, difficulty breathing, and cough. Ozone metrics included 24-hr average, peak 1-hr, and maximum 8-hr average. Analyses were repeated for the 61 infants whose mothers had asthma. RESULTS: For every interquartile-range increase in same-day 24-hr average ozone, likelihood of wheeze increased 37% [95% confidence interval (CI), 2-84%]. Among infants of asthmatic mothers, same-day 24-hr average ozone increased likelihood of wheeze 59% (95% CI, 1-154%) and of difficulty breathing 83% (95% CI, 42-136%). Maximum 8-hr ozone and peak 1-hr ozone were associated with difficulty breathing, but not wheeze, in infants of asthmatic mothers. Ozone was not associated with cough.

The U.S. EPA Building Assessment Survey and Evaluation (BASE) study data were analyzed for associations between ambient ozone concentrations and building-related symptom (BRS) prevalence. Multiple logistic regression (MLR) models, adjusted for personal, workplace, and environmental variables, revealed positive relationships (P < 0.05) between ambient ozone concentrations and upper respiratory (UR), dry eyes, neurological and headache BRS (odds ratios ranged from 1.03 to 1.04 per 10 mug/m(3) increase in ambient ozone concentrations). Other BRS had marginally significant relationships with ambient ozone (P < 0.10). A linear dose-response in UR symptoms was observed with increasing ambient ozone (P = 0.03); most other symptoms showed similar but not statistically significant trends. Ambient ozone correlated with indoor concentrations of some aldehydes, a pattern suggesting the occurrence of indoor ozone chemistry. Coupled with the MLR ambient ozone-BRS analysis, this correlation is consistent with the hypothesis that ozone-initiated indoor reactions play an important role in indoor air quality and building occupant health. Replication with increased statistical power and with longitudinal data is needed. If the observed associations are confirmed as causal, ventilation system ozone removal technologies could reduce UR BRS prevalence when higher ambient ozone levels are present. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS: This paper provides strong statistical evidence that supports (but does not prove) the hypothesis that ozone entrained into buildings from the outdoor air is involved in increasing the frequency that occupants experience and a range of upper and lower respiratory, mucosal and neurological symptoms by as much as a factor of 2 when ambient ozone levels increase from those found in low-ozone regions to those typical of high-ozone regions. Although replication is needed, the implication is that reducing the amount of ozone entrained into building ventilation systems, either by ambient pollution reduction or engineered gas-phase filtration, may substantially reduce the prevalence of these symptoms experienced by occupants."

This investigation evaluated the numbers and functional capabilities of alveolar macrophages (AM) recovered from rabbits undergoing acute and subchronic ozone exposure. Bronchoalveolar lavage was performed immediately, 24 h, and 7 d after acute (2-h) exposure to 0.1 or 1.2 ppm ozone, and on d 3, 7, and 14 during subchronic (2 h/d X 13 d) exposure to 0.1 ppm ozone. After acute exposure to 1.2 ppm, a marked increase in lavaged neutrophils was observed at 24 h. A single exposure to 0.1 ppm resulted in increased AM at 7 d, while repeated exposures resulted in an increase in AM and neutrophils on d 7 and 14. AM phagocytosis was depressed immediately and 24 h after acute exposure to 0.1 ppm, and at all time points after exposure to 1.2 ppm. Repeated exposures to 0.1 ppm produced reductions in the numbers of phagocytically active AM on d 3 and 7, with a return to control levels by d 14. Substrate attachment by AM was impaired immediately after exposure to 1.2 ppm; AM mobility was not altered by any of the ozone exposures. The results of these studies demonstrated significant alterations in the numbers and functional properties of AM as a result of single or repeated exposure to 0.1 ppm ozone, a level below the current National Ambient Air Quality Standard. These findings indicate that levels of ozone frequently encountered in areas of high photochemical air pollution can elicit a pulmonary inflammatory response and can impair pulmonary defense capabilities."

Rats exposed to 0.1 or 0.3 ppm O3 for 4 h/day, 5 days/wk, for 1 or 3 wk were analyzed for the ability to clear an intrapulmonary challenge with Listeria monocytogenes or had their lungs processed to obtain pulmonary alveolar macrophages (PAM) and lung-associated lymphocytes for analyses of select cell functions and surface marker expression. The results indicate that repeated inhalation exposure to O3 affected local cell-mediated immunity (CMI) responses as evidenced by effects on clearance of Listeria. However, this modulation was not consistently dependent on exposure concentration or duration. Short-term repeat exposures had more effect on host resistance than did the more prolonged regimen, with rats exposed to 0.1 ppm O3 most adversely impacted. Clearance patterns suggest modifications in innate resistance following 1 wk of exposure to 0.1 ppm O3, but no similar effect following a 3-wk regimen. Exposure to 0.3 ppm O3 appeared to affect both innate and acquired resistance after a 1-wk regimen, but mainly the former after an additional wk of exposure. We conclude that these two mechanisms of resistance are differentially affected by O3 and that distinct time- and O3 concentration-dependent adaptation phenomena evolve for each; that is, in situ adaptation to higher levels of O3 may occur more readily with acquired than with innate/PAM-dependent resistance. A similar pattern of inconsistent effect on PAM and lung-associated lymphocytes was also evident. For example, while 3-wk exposures had a greater effect on PAM reactive oxygen intermediate ROI production, evidence for a significant effect on antibacterial activity was only notable among PAM from rats exposed for 1 wk. Among lung lymphocytes, while 3-wk exposure to 0.1 ppm O3 led to a significant increase in CD25 expression, there was no corresponding increase in responsivity to concanavalin A (ConA); only among cells from 1-wk-exposed rats did lymphoproliferative responses increase. Though investigations of altered immune cell cytokine receptor expression/binding activity are ongoing results herein provide further evidence to support our longstanding hypothesis that some well-documented effects of O3 exposure on human health are quite likely linked to changes in local immune cell (i.e., PAM and lung-associated lymphocytes) functions, with the latter being related to changes in the capacities of these cells to interact with immunoregulatory cytokines."

results of 4-h inhalation exposures to 0.8 parts per million O3 on pulmonary macrophage viability and phagocytosis capacity in

ozone- and air-exposed toads. Macrophage yield did not differ among exposure groups nor did exposure to elevated temperatures

They employ several mechanisms, including phagocytosis and secretion of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species. fMLP, a formylated peptide of bacterial origin, is a potent inducer of phagocyte chemotaxis and is also involved in generating antimicrobial agents such as nitric oxide (NO) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). In this study we analysed the in vitro effects of fMLP on the mobility of the THP-1 cell line, which served as a model for alveolar macrophages. Cell mobility and cytotoxicity were also analysed after pre-exposures to an atmosphere polluted with ozone (0.03-0.5 ppm) followed by a fMLP treatment. Finally, the secreted molecules (H2O2 and NO) were measured after ozone exposures ranging from 5 to 30 min and fMLP action. Activation by fMLP alone induced cell movement, whereas pre-exposure to the ozone concentrations decreased it. Addition of fMLP had different effects on cytotoxicity, mobility and metabolite secretion by the cells: (1) cytotoxicity increased depending on ozone concentrations and exposure times; (2) during the first 5 min and for all ozone concentrations, an average decrease of 50% of activated cell mobility was observed; (3) H2O2 was increased, even in combination with ozone; (4) NO was detected at 731 nM, a result that was not affected by ozone pre-exposure."

The ozone-mediated abatement of the lung injury was independent of peak pulmonary virus titers. However, determination of the sites of virus multiplication indicated that exposure to ozone resulted in a less widespread infection of the lung parenchyma. Furthermore, ozone exposure reduced the antiviral immune response as shown by reduced numbers of phenotypically quantitated T- and B-lymphocytes recovered from lung tissues and reduction of serum antibody titers. Since the pathogenesis of influenza virus infection depends on both the site of viral replication and the antiviral immune response, these studies suggest that redistribution of virus growth in murine lungs and immunosuppressive mechanisms are factors in the ozone-reduced disease severity."

For this purpose rats were continuously exposed to O3 concentrations ranging from 0.25 to 2.0 mg/m3 for a period of 1 week. In this model defense to a respiratory infection with Listeria depends on acquired specific cellular immune responses, as well as on natural nonspecific defense mechanisms. The results confirm earlier findings that show that ozone exposure can suppress the capacity of macrophages to ingest and kill Listeria. Moreover, the results show that ozone can also have a suppressive effect on the development of cellular immune responses to a respiratory Listeria infection, i.e., on T/B ratios in lung draining lymph nodes, delayed-type hypersensitivity responses to Listeria antigen, and lymphoproliferative responses in spleen and lung draining lymph nodes to Listeria antigen. The effects on the specific immune responses are especially overt if exposure to the oxidant gas occurs during an ongoing primary infection. The pathological lesions induced by a pulmonary Listeria monocytogenes infection were characterized by multifocal infiltrates of histiocytic and lymphoid cells. The foci sometimes had a granulomatous appearance. Moreover, the cellularity of the interstitial tissues was increased. In the lung many diffuse alveolar macrophages could be seen in the alveoli. Ozone exposure greatly increased the severity of the lung lesions and also of liver lesions resulting from the pulmonary infection. A prominent finding was the formation of granulomas in ozone-exposed and Listeria-infected rats. This increased severity of the lesions after ozone exposure and subsequent infection with Listeria was presumably not a result of additive ozone and Listeria-induced lesions, but rather an effect of ozone-induced impaired clearance of the bacteria, caused by depressed macrophage activity and cellular immunity. T-cell-dependent immune responses form an important component of defense to respiratory infections with bacteria and viruses, and possibly also to neoplasms. Since our study unequivocally shows an effect on T-cell-dependent immunity, ozone exposure has to be judged potentially hazardous with respect to such challenges of the lung."

Lymphoid cell suspensions, obtained after enzymatic dispersion of rat lungs and purification over nylon wool columns, showed in vitro natural killer activity toward YAC lymphoma cells. Validation of the test with well-known NK activity stimulators such as Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG), interleukin-2 (IL-2), interferon (IFN), and inhibitors like anti-asialo-GM1 (ganglio-n-tetrasylceramide) antibody confirmed the reliability of the test as an assay for detecting NK activity in rat lungs.

Inhalation exposure to O3 for 7 days at 0.4 and 0.8 mg/m3 resulted in stimulation, and exposure at 1.6 mg O3/m3 resulted in suppression of NK activity. Oral exposure to HCB in concentrations of 150 and 450 mg/kg food for 6 weeks suppressed NK activity in rat lungs in a dose-related manner. This was also true for 6 weeks of oral exposure of rats to 20 and 80 mg TBTO/kg food, but to a lesser extent.

Continuous ozone exposures at 1.0 ppm were performed for 23.5 hours per day for either 1, 5, 7, or 10 consecutive days. Pulmonary immune function was assessed by measuring natural killer (NK) activity from whole-lung homogenates of male Fischer-344 rats. Results of this study indicated that continuous ozone exposure for 1, 5, or 7 days resulted in a significant decrease in pulmonary NK activity. This suppressed pulmonary NK activity returned to control levels after continuous exposure to ozone for 10 days. The suppressed pulmonary NK response was thus attenuated and returned to normal values in the continued presence of ozone gas. This attenuation process is dynamic, complex, and doubtless involves several cell types and/or products of these cells. Pulmonary NK activity was also suppressed at 0.5 ppm ozone, but not at 0.1 ppm ozone, following 23.5 hours of exposure. NK activity is important for defense against viral, bacterial, and neoplastic disease.

We assessed modification of influenza by adding variables for concentrations of single ambient air pollutants and proportions of influenza-positive specimens (influenza intensity) and their cross-product terms. RESULTS: We found significant effect modification of influenza (p < 0.05) for effects of ozone. When influenza intensity is assumed to increase from 0% to 10%, the excess risks per 10-microg/m(3) increase in concentration of O(3) increased 0.24% and 0.40% for hospitalization of respiratory disease in the all-ages group and >or= 65 year age group, respectively; 0.46% for hospitalization of acute respiratory disease in the all-ages group; and 0.40% for hospitalization of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in the >or= 65 group.

Objective: The hypothesis was that air pollutants exacerbate allergic symptoms of the nose and eyes during the pollen season. In addition, the use of allergen measurements instead of pollen counts should be tested. 
 Methods: Fifteen pollen-allergic, nonsmoking subjects with weak reactivity of the airways recorded rhinoconjunctival symptoms and medication every morning and evening throughout the pollen season. Symptoms were compared with air pollutants (nitrogen oxide [NOx], particulate matter smaller than 10  m, and ozone) and birch and grass pollen counts or, alternatively, to airborne birch and grass allergens determined using ELISA-techniques. A multiple linear regression model was used which controlled for autocorrelation of the residuals of the time series (Cochrane-Orcutt approach). This model was applied to each subject individually, followed by calculations of summary scores for the group. 
 Results: Air pollution levels were moderate, often meeting air quality standards. Effect estimates (increase of score with 10-fold increase of concentration) were NOx = 1.06, P <0.01; ozone = 1.59, P < 0.01; and pollen = 0.48, P <0.001.Using allergen concentrations instead of pollen counts resulted in similar effect estimates. Using particulate matter smaller than 10  m instead of NOx gave comparable but less consistent results. 
 Conclusions: Symptoms were related to moderate levels of pollutants, suggesting that rhinoconjunctival tissue is very sensitive to irritant stimuli during an ongoing allergic inflammation, and that susceptibility toward allergens might be increased in areas with increased levels of air pollutants. Allergen measurements seem equally usable as pollen counts to investigate rhinoconjunctivitis."

(2) IL-12, IL-12p40 and IL-10 production by mDCs from allergic asthmatics was significantly lower than that from healthy donors, respectively. (3) IL-4 production by Th cells primed by mDCs from allergic asthmatics was increased compared with that from healthy donors.

CONCLUSIONS: mDCs from allergic asthmatics preferentially priming naive T cells towards Th2-cell development might be due to increased expression of CD86 and reduced production of IL-12 and IL-10."

Here, we show that proteins, in particular birch pollen proteins including the allergen Bet v 1, are efficiently nitrated by polluted air. This posttranslational modification of proteins is likely to trigger immune reactions and provides a molecular rationale for the promotion of allergies by traffic-related air pollution. Enzyme immunoassays have been used to determine equivalent degrees of nitration (EDN) for protein samples exposed to urban outdoor air and synthetic gas mixtures. The observed rates of nitration were governed by the abundance of nitrogen oxides and ozone, and concentration levels typical for summer smog conditions led to substantial nitration within a few hours to days (EDN up to 20%). Moreover, nitrated proteins were detected in urban road dust, window dust, and fine air particulate matter (EDN up to 0.1%)."

To determine the influence of gaseous air pollutants on neonatal respiratory morbidity, we tested the association between daily respiratory hospitalizations and daily concentrations of ambient air pollution gases: ozone, carbon monoxide, sulfur dioxide, and nitrogen dioxide, in 11 large Canadian cities. 

STUDY DESIGN: Daily time-series analyses were employed and results were adjusted for day of the week, temperature, barometric pressure, and relative humidity. 

RESULTS: The percent increases in hospitalization associated with an increase in air pollution equivalent to its interquartile range were 3.35 [95% confidence interval (CI), 1.73-4.77] for O3, 2.85 (95% CI, 1.68-4.02) for NO2, 1.66 (95% CI, 0.63-2.69) for SO2, and 1.75 (95% CI, 0.48-3.02) for CO. The independent effect of all pollutants combined was 9.61% (95% CI, 4.52-14.7%).

CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that neonates are experiencing adverse effects of air pollution at current levels in Canada, and that accounts for a significant proportion of hospitalizations in this subgroup."

The current project, a component of the NYS Environmental Public Health Tracking Program, investigated a potential association between ambient ozone (O(3)) concentration and childhood respiratory hospital admissions over 11 years in NYS. METHODS: We used a two-stage Bayesian hierarchical model to assess the exposure-disease associations within 11 geographic regions and statewide. The data included total daily hospital admissions due to respiratory diseases for children 0-17 years old from 1991 to 2001 in NYS (N=134,099) and daily ambient O(3) level with different single-day lags. These analyses adjusted for particulate matter 10 microm in size (PM(10)), meteorological conditions, day of the week, seasonality, long-term trends, and demographic characteristics. RESULTS: In 5 of the 11 regions, including the Upper and Lower Adirondacks, Upper Hudson Valley, Staten Island, and New York City, positive associations were found between respiratory hospital admissions and ambient O(3) level 2 days prior to the admission. Applying different statistical methods and sensitivity analysis of PM(10) did not alter these findings. When region-specific results were combined, no statewide association was apparent. CONCLUSIONS: Geographic differences were found in the associations between O(3) levels and respiratory hospital admissions among children. In addition, we found that the two-stage model may be an appropriate approach for tracking the health effects of air pollution over time in different geographic areas when heterogeneity of risk factors across regions is present."

In a meta-analysis based on the city-specific regression models, several city characteristics were evaluated as effect modifiers. During the warm season, the 2-day cumulative effect of a 5-ppb increase in ozone was a 0.27% (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.08, 0.47) increase in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease admissions and a 0.41% (95% CI: 0.26, 0.57) increase in pneumonia admissions. Similarly, a 10-microg/m(3) increase in PM10 during the warm season resulted in a 1.47% (95% CI: 0.93, 2.01) increase in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease at lag 1 and a 0.84% (95% CI: 0.50, 1.19) increase in pneumonia at lag 0. Percentage of households with central air conditioning reduced the effect of air pollution, and variability of summer apparent temperature reduced the effect of ozone on chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. The study confirmed, in a large sample of cities, that exposure to ozone and PM10 is associated with respiratory hospital admissions and provided evidence that the effect of air pollution is modified by certain city characteristics."

Nitrogen dioxide and carbon monoxide were significantly associated with hospitalization for COPD, and the magnitude of effects was increased slightly with increasing days of exposure averaging, with the relative risk for a 7-day average being 1.11 (95%CI: 1.04, 1.20) and 1.08 (1.02, 1.13) for nitrogen dioxide and carbon monoxide, respectively. There was no significant association between either sulfur dioxide or ozone and COPD hospitalization. The combined relative risk for all four gaseous pollutants on COPD hospitalization was 1.21. The effects of gaseous pollutants on COPD hospitalization were not significant after adjustment for PM10, although its inclusion did not have a marked effect on the point estimates for relative risks. Nitrogen dioxide has a significant impact on COPD hospitalization.

In general these have been analysed in association with PM(10) and ozone, whereas PM(2.5) is now the particle measure of greatest health and regulatory concern. And little has been published on associations of hospital admissions and PM components. DESIGN: This study analysed hospital admissions for myocardial infarction (15 578 patients), and pneumonia (24 857 patients) in associations with fine particulate air pollution, black carbon (BC), ozone, nitrogen dioxide (NO(2)), PM not from traffic, and carbon monoxide (CO) in the greater Boston area for the years 1995-1999 using a case-crossover analysis, with control days matched on temperature.

Ambient fine particles (particular matter <2.5 ?m diameter [PM2.5]) and ozone exacerbate respiratory conditions including asthma. There is little documentation determining whether children are more vulnerable to the effects of ambient pollution than adults, or whether pollution causes life-threatening episodes requiring intensive care unit (ICU) admission.

Objective
We investigate the relationship between severe asthma morbidity and PM2.5 and ozone in the warm season, and determine whether there is an age-related susceptibility to pollution.

Methods
Daily time-series analysis of 6008 asthma ICU admissions and 69,375 general (non-ICU) asthma admissions in 4 age groups (<6, 6-18, 19-49, and 50+ years) in 74 New York City hospitals for the months April to August from 1999 to 2006. The regression model adjusted for temporal trends, weather, and day of the week. Risks were estimated for interquartile range increases in the a priori exposure time window of the average of 0-day and 1-day lagged pollutants.

Results
Age was a significant effect modifier for hospitalizations, and children age 6 to 18 years consistently had the highest risk. Among children age 6 to 18 years, there was a 26% (95% CI, 10% to 44%) increased rate of ICU admissions and a 19% increased rate of general hospitalizations (95% CI, 12% to 27%) for each 12-?g/m3 increase in PM2.5. For each 22-ppb increase in ozone, there was a 19% (95% CI, 1% to 40%) increased risk for ICU admissions and a 20% (95% CI, 11% to 29%) increased risk for general hospitalizations.

Conclusion
Warm weather patterns of ozone and PM2.5 disproportionately affect children with asthma and appear responsible for severe attacks that could have been avoided."

METHODS: A time-series analysis was conducted on nearly 400,000 ED visits to 14 hospitals in seven Canadian cities during the 1990 s and early 2000s. Associations were examined between carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), ozone (O3), sulfur dioxide (SO2), and particulate matter (PM 10 and PM2.5), and visits for angina/myocardial infarction, heart failure, dysrhythmia/conduction disturbance, asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and respiratory infections. Daily and 3-hourly visit counts were modeled as quasi-Poisson and analyses controlled for effects of temporal cycles, weather, day of week and holidays. 

RESULTS: 24-hour average concentrations of CO and NO2 lag 0 days exhibited the most consistent associations with cardiac conditions (2.1% (95% CI, 0.0-4.2%) and 2.6% (95% CI, 0.2-5.0%) increase in visits for myocardial infarction/angina per 0.7 ppm CO and 18.4 ppb NO2 respectively; 3.8% (95% CI, 0.7-6.9%) and 4.7% (95% CI, 1.2-8.4%) increase in visits for heart failure). Ozone (lag 2 days) was most consistently associated with respiratory visits (3.2% (95% CI, 0.3-6.2%), and 3.7% (95% CI, -0.5-7.9%) increases in asthma and COPD visits respectively per 18.4 ppb). Associations tended to be of greater magnitude during the warm season (April - September). In particular, the associations of PM 10 and PM2.5 with asthma visits were respectively nearly three- and over fourfold larger vs. all year analyses (14.4% increase in visits, 95% CI, 0.2-30.7, per 20.6 microg/m3 PM 10 and 7.6% increase in visits, 95% CI, 5.1-10.1, per 8.2 microg/m3 PM2.5). No consistent associations were observed between three hour average pollutant concentrations and same-day three hour averages of ED visits. 

CONCLUSION: In this large multicenter analysis, daily average concentrations of CO and NO2 exhibited the most consistent associations with ED visits for cardiac conditions, while ozone exhibited the most consistent associations with visits for respiratory conditions. PM 10 and PM2.5 were strongly associated with asthma visits during the warm season."

In the presence of differing levels of measurement error across pollutants under consideration, however, they can be biased and as misleading as single-pollutant models. Their appropriate interpretation depends on the relationships among the pollutant measurements and the outcomes in question. In situations where two or more pollutant variables may be acting as surrogates for the etiologic agent(s), multipollutant models can help identify the best surrogate, but the risk estimates may be influenced by inclusion of a second variable that is not itself an independent risk factor for the outcome in question. In this paper, these issues will be illustrated in the context of an ongoing study of emergency visits in Atlanta. Emergency department visits from 41 of 42 hospitals serving the twenty-county Atlanta metropolitan area for the period 1993-2004 (n=10,206,389 visits) were studied in relation to ambient pollutant levels, including speciated particle measurements from an intensive monitoring campaign at a downtown station starting in 1998. Relative to our earlier publications, reporting results through 2000, the period for which the speciated data are now available is now tripled (six years in length). Poisson generalized linear models were used to examine outcome counts in relation to three-day moving average concentrations of pollutants of a priori interest (ozone, nitrogen dioxide, carbon monoxide, sulfur dioxide, oxygenated hydrocarbons, PM10, coarse PM, PM2.5, and the following components of PM2.5: elemental carbon, organic carbon, sulfate, water-soluble transition metals.) In the present analysis, we report results for two outcome groups: a respiratory outcomes group and a cardiovascular outcomes group. For cardiovascular visits, associations were observed with CO, 3 NO2, and PM2.5 elemental carbon and organic carbon. In multipollutant models, CO was the strongest predictor. For respiratory visits, associations were observed with ozone, PM10, CO and NO2 in single-pollutant models. In multipollutant models, PM10 and ozone persisted as predictors, with ozone the stronger predictor. Caveats and considerations in interpreting the multipollutant model results are discussed."

However, few have examined the possible confounding influence of aeroallergens, or reported findings among very young children. METHODS: A time stratified case-crossover design was used to examine 57,912 ED asthma visits among individuals two years of age and older in the census metropolitan area of Edmonton, Canada between April 1, 1992 and March 31, 2002. Daily air pollution levels for the entire region were estimated from three fixed-site monitoring stations. Similarly, daily levels of aeroallergens were estimated using rotational impaction sampling methods for the period between 1996 and 2002. Odds ratios and their corresponding 95% confidence intervals were estimated using conditional logistic regression with adjustment for temperature, relative humidity and seasonal epidemics of viral related respiratory disease. RESULTS: Positive associations for asthma visits with outdoor air pollution levels were observed between April and September, but were absent during the remainder of the year. Effects were strongest among young children. Namely, an increase in the interquartile range of the 5-day average for NO2 and CO levels between April and September was associated with a 50% and 48% increase, respectively, in the number of ED visits among children 2 - 4 years of age (p < 0.05). Strong associations were also observed with these pollutants among those 75 years of age and older. Ozone and particulate matter were also associated with asthma visits. Air pollution risk estimates were largely unchanged after adjustment for aeroallergen levels. CONCLUSION: Our findings, taken together, suggest that exposure to ambient levels of air pollution is an important determinant of ED visits for asthma, particularly among young children and the elderly."

These studies often considered other gaseous co-pollutants also as potential confounders, including nitrogen dioxide (NO2), sulfur dioxide (SO2), and carbon monoxide (CO). However, because each of these air pollutants can have different seasonal patterns and chemical interactions, the estimation and interpretation of each pollutant's individual risk estimates may not be straightforward. Multi-collinearity among the air pollution and weather variables also leaves the possibility of confounding and over- or under-fitting of meteorological variables, thereby potentially influencing the health effect estimates for the various pollutants in differing ways. To investigate these issues, we examined the temporal relationships among air pollution and weather variables in the context of air pollution health effects models. We compiled daily data for PM less than 2.5 mum (PM2.5), ozone, NO2, SO2, CO, temperature, dew point, relative humidity, wind speed, and barometric pressure for New York City for the years 1999-2002. We conducted several sets of analyses to characterize air pollution and weather data interactions, to assess different aspects of these data issues: (1) spatial/temporal variation of PM2.5 and gaseous pollutants measured at multiple monitors; (2) temporal relationships among air pollution and weather variables; and (3) extent and nature of multi-collinearity of air pollution and weather variables in the context of health effects models. The air pollution variables showed a varying extent of intercorrelations with each other and with weather variables, and these correlations also varied across seasons. For example, NO2 exhibited the strongest negative correlation with wind speed among the pollutants considered, while ozone's correlation with PM2.5 changed signs across the seasons (positive in summer and negative in winter). The extent of multi-collinearity problems also varied across pollutants and choice of health effects models commonly used in the literature. These results indicate that the health effects regression need to be run by season for some pollutants to provide the most meaningful results. We also find that model choice and interpretation needs to take into consideration the varying pollutant concurvities with the model co-variables in each pollutant's health effects model specification. Finally, we provide an example for analysis of associations between these air pollutants and asthma emergency department visits in New York City, which evaluate the relationship between the various pollutants' risk estimates and their respective concurvities, and discuss the limitations that these results imply about the interpretability of multi-pollutant health effects models."

To advance understanding of these relationships, further characterization of the dose-response and pollutant lag effects are needed, as are investigations of pollutant species beyond the commonly measured criteria pollutants. Objectives: Investigate short-term associations between ambient air pollutant concentrations and emergency department visits for pediatric asthma. Methods: Daily counts of emergency department visits for asthma or wheeze among children age 5 to 17 were collected from 41 Metropolitan Atlanta hospitals during 1993-2004 (n = 91,386 visits). Ambient concentrations of gaseous pollutants and speciated particulate matter were available from stationary monitors during this time period. Rate ratios for the warm season (May-October) and cold season (November-April) were estimated using Poisson generalized linear models in the framework of a case-crossover analysis. Measurements and Main Results: Both ozone and primary pollutants from traffic sources were associated with emergency department visits for asthma or wheeze; evidence for independent effects of ozone and primary pollutants from traffic sources were observed in multipollutant models. These associations tended to be of the highest magnitude for concentrations on the day of the emergency department visit and were present at relatively low ambient concentrations. Conclusions: Even at relatively low ambient concentrations, ozone and primary pollutants from traffic sources independently contributed to the burden of emergency department visits for pediatric asthma."

Objective: To determine whether ozone exposure in Seattle is associated with increased use of hospital emergency departments.

Methods: Hospital data on daily asthma cases for all ages were obtained for 1998 through 2002. Ozone and fine particulate matter (?2.5 ?m in diameter) (PM2.5) data were obtained from local air agencies. Poisson regression models were used to assess the association between asthma visits to emergency departments and air pollutants. Maximum daily 1- and 8-hour average ozone concentrations and the daily PM2.5 concentration were used.

Results: We observed associations between both ozone metrics and emergency department visits in children. For the maximum daily 1- and 8-hour average ozone concentrations, the relative risks (RRs) were 1.08 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.00-1.18) and 1.11 (95% CI, 1.02-1.21), respectively, at 3 days' lag. Weaker but significant associations were also observed for adults. For the maximum daily 1-hour average ozone concentration, the RR was 1.06 (95% CI, 1.01-1.11) at 4 days' lag, and for the maximum daily 8-hour average ozone concentration, the RR was 1.06 (95% CI, 1.01-1.12) at 2 days' lag and 1.08 (95% CI, 1.02-1.14) at 4 days' lag.

Conclusion: Ozone exposure exacerbates asthma in people in the Seattle area, especially in children."

Few studies examined associations between air pollution and emergency room (ER) visits for wheezing, and even fewer for gastroenteric illness. We conducted a multicity analysis of the relationship between air pollution and ER visits for wheezing and gastroenteric disorder in children 0?2 years of age.

Methods: We obtained ER visit records for wheezing and gastroenteric disorder from six Italian cities. A city-specific case?crossover analysis was applied to estimate effects of particulate matter (PM), nitrogen dioxide, sulfur dioxide, ozone, and carbon monoxide, adjusting for immediate and delayed effects of temperature. Lagged effects of air pollutants up to 6 prior days were examined. The city-specific results were combined using a random-effect meta-analysis.

Results: CO and SO2 were most strongly associated with wheezing, with a 2.7% increase [95% confidence interval (CI), 0.5?4.9] for a 1.04-?g/m3 increase in 7-day average CO and a 3.4% (95% CI, 1.5?5.3) increase for an 8.0-?g/m3 increase in SO2. Positive associations were also found for PM with aerodynamic diameter ? 10 ?g and NO2. We found a significant association between the 3-day moving average CO and gastroenteric disorders [3.8% increase (95% CI, 1.0?6.8)]. When data were stratified by season, the associations were stronger in summer for wheezing and in winter for gastroenteric disorders.

Conclusion: Air pollution is associated with triggering of wheezing and gastroenteric disorders in children 0?2 years of age; more work is needed to understand the mechanisms to help prevent wheezing in children.

Asthma morbidity also varies with socioeconomic position (SEP). Few studies have examined if ambient air pollution has a differential impact on income subgroups of the population. This paper investigates socioeconomic variation in ambulatory physician consultations for asthma and assesses possible effect modification of SEP on the association between physician visits and air pollution for children aged 1-17 and adults aged 18-64 in Toronto, Canada, between 1992 and 2001. METHODS: Generalized additive models and generalized linear models were used to estimate the adjusted risk of asthma physician visits associated with an interquartile range increase in sulfur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), particulate matter (PM2.5), and ozone (O3). RESULTS: A socioeconomic gradient in the number of physician visits was observed among children and adults and both sexes. SO2, NO2, and PM2.5 had positive associations with physician visits. The risk ratios for the low socioeconomic group were significantly greater than those for the high socioeconomic group in several of the models of SO2 and PM2.5. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest increased ambulatory physician visits represent another component of the public health impact of urban air pollution. The burden of this impact may be borne disproportionately by those with lower SEP. Clarifying the role of SEP in altering susceptibility to the effects of air pollution is essential not only to inform revisions of ambient air quality standards, but also to design public health interventions to reduce health impacts on sensitive subgroups of the population."

The aim of this study was to examine the relationship between outdoor air pollution and physician visits for allergic rhinitis among individuals>or=65 years of age in Toronto, Canada. METHODS: Physician visits were identified by using data from the Ontario provincial health insurance plan that is made available to all residents. Our analyses are based on 52,691 physician visits for allergic rhinitis among individuals>or=65 years of age in the Toronto metropolitan area between 1995 and 2000. Generalized linear models were used to regress daily counts of physician visits against daily measures of gaseous and particulate components of air pollution after controlling for seasonality, potential confounders (temperature, relative humidity, aeroallergens), overdispersion and serial correlation. RESULTS: A large number of comparisons were undertaken, with most showing no statistically significant associations between daily levels of air pollution and the number of physician visits for rhinitis. In contrast, an interquartile increase in the 10-day average of ragweed particles increased the mean number of daily rhinitis consultations by 6.4% (95% CI=0.7-12.4%).

Although it can be expected that reductions in air pollutants are associated with reductions in health effects, it is unclear whether this is actually the case. The purpose of this analysis was to compare the levels of and relationships between air pollutants and acute respiratory outpatient visits for two consecutive time periods totaling 53 mo. Air pollution data were collected at a centrally located monitor in Atlanta, GA, and include 24-hr averages of particulate matter (PM) less than 2.5 ?m in aerodynamic diameter (PM2.5) and its components; coarse PM (PM<sub>10-2.5</sub>); PM less than 10 ?m in aerodynamic diameter (PM<sub>10</sub>); oxygenated volatile organic compounds (OVOCs); 8-hr maximum ozone (O<sub>3</sub>); and 1-hr maximum nitrogen dioxide (NO<sub>2</sub>), carbon monoxide (CO), and sulfur dioxide (SO<sub>2</sub>). In addition, several metals and fractions of elemental carbon (EC) and organic carbon (OC) were investigated. Daily outpatient visit data were obtained from the electronic data warehouse of the Atlanta-based region of a nonprofit managed care organization. Poisson general linear modeling determined associations between daily levels of acute visits for four diagnosis groups (adult and child asthma, upper and lower respiratory infection) and air pollution measurements. Overall declining trends were observed in air pollutants and acute visits over the study period. Childhood asthma had the greatest number of significant associations with air pollutants, namely zinc and EC. The significant lag time between pollutant measurement and visit occurrence changed from 3-5 days in the first time period to 6-8 days in the later time period, but there was general consistency in several childhood asthma and pollutant associations over both time periods. The greatest evidence for a reduction in pollution being associated with an improvement in health response was for lower respiratory disease visits, but even in this case changes in other factors that influence health responses make it difficult to demonstrate that changes in pollutant levels influence health outcomes.

We used daily measurements for particulate matter less than 10 mum in aerodynamic diameter (PM10) and/or black smoke from 29 European cities. We considered confounding from other pollutants as well as meteorologic and chronologic variables. We investigated several variables describing the cities' pollution, climate, population, and geography as potential effect modifiers. For the individual city analysis, generalized additive models extending Poisson regression, using a smoother to control for seasonal patterns, were applied. To provide quantitative summaries of the results and explain remaining heterogeneity, we applied second-stage regression models. The estimated increase in the daily number of deaths for all ages for a 10 mug/m(3) increase in daily PM10 or black smoke concentrations was 0.6% [95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.4-0.8%], whereas for the elderly it was slightly higher. We found important effect modification for several of the variables studied. Thus, in a city with low average NO2, the estimated increase in daily mortality for an increase of 10 mug/m(3) in PM10 was 0.19 (95% CI = 0.00-0.41), whereas in a city with high average NO2 it was 0.80% (95% CI = 0.67-0.93%); in a relatively cold climate the corresponding effect was 0.29% (95% CI = 0.16-0.42), whereas in a warm climate it was 0.82% (95% CI = 0.69-0.96); in a city with low standardized mortality rate it was 0.80% (95% CI = 0.65-0.95%), and in one with a high rate it was 0.43% (95% CI = 0.24-0.62). Our results confirm those previously reported on the effects of ambient particles on mortality. Furthermore, they show that the heterogeneity found in the effect parameters among cities reflects real effect modification, which is explained by specific city characteristics."

METHODS: Emergency department visits for pediatric asthma exacerbations were collected from Atlanta hospitals. Concentrations of carbon monoxide, nitrogen dioxide, ozone, sulfur dioxide, particulate matter less than 10 microns in diameter (PM10), particulate matter less than 2.5 microns in diameter (PM2.5), and the PM2.5 components elemental carbon, organic carbon, and sulfate were obtained from networks of ambient air quality monitors. For each pollutant we created three different daily metrics. For one metric we used the measurements from a centrally-located monitor; for the second we averaged measurements across the network of monitors; and for the third we estimated the population-weighted average concentration using an isotropic spatial model. Rate ratios for each of the metrics were estimated from time-series models. RESULTS: For pollutants with relatively homogeneous spatial distributions we observed only small differences in the rate ratio across the three metrics. Conversely, for spatially heterogeneous pollutants we observed larger differences in the rate ratios. For a given pollutant, the strength of evidence for an association (i.e., chi-square statistics) tended to be similar across metrics. CONCLUSIONS: Given that the chi-square statistics were similar across the metrics, the differences in the rate ratios for the spatially heterogeneous pollutants may seem like a relatively small issue. However, these differences are important for health benefits analyses, where results from epidemiological studies on the health effects of pollutants (per unit change in concentration) are used to predict the health impacts of a reduction in pollutant concentrations. We discuss the relative merits of the different metrics as they pertain to time-series studies and health benefits analyses."

The harvesting hypothesis posits that the deaths associated with an exposure are occurring in people who are dying already, and the effect of exposure is merely to move the death from one day to an earlier day, and has no other effects that would influence deaths.

Objectives: The aim of this study was to analyze the effect of ozone on mortality, and the extent to which this is due to short-term mortality displacement in 48 U.S. cities between 1989 and 2000.

Methods: Time series of mortality and ozone were investigated with a generalized linear model during the June?August months, controlling for season, day of the week, and apparent temperature. We examined an unconstrained and a smooth distributed lag with 21 lags of ozone, and effect modification for city-specific characteristics.

Measurements and Main Results: We found a 0.3% (95% confidence interval, 0.2?0.4) increase in total mortality for a 10-ppb increase in 8-hour ozone at lag 0 during summer months. The effect increased to 0.5% (95% confidence interval, 0.05?0.96) when looking at the unconstrained distributed lag. The shape of the distributed lag indicates that all the effect is in the first week.

Conclusions: We did not find mortality displacement due to ozone; rather, the effect size estimate when looking at 21 days of ozone was larger than when using a single day's ozone concentration. Therefore, these results indicate that risk assessments using the single day of ozone exposure are likely to underestimate, rather than overestimate, the public health impact."

However, only a few studies have focused on subgroups of the population especially vulnerable to these effects. OBJECTIVES: To estimate the association between exposure to ozone and cause-specific mortality, and to evaluate whether individual socio-demographic characteristics as well as chronic conditions confer greater susceptibility to the adverse effects of ozone. METHODS: A case-crossover analysis was conducted in 10 Italian cities. Data on mortality were collected for the period 2001-2005 (April to September), for 127,860 deceased subjects. Information was retrieved on cause of death, socio-demographic characteristics, chronic conditions from previous hospital admissions, and location of death. Daily ozone concentrations were collected from background fixed monitors. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: We estimated a 1.5% (95% confidence interval, 0.9-2.1) increase in total mortality for a 10 mug/m(3) increase in ozone (8-hour, lag 0-5). The effect lasted several days for total, cardiac and respiratory mortality (lag 0-5) and it was delayed for cerebrovascular deaths (lag 3-5). In the subgroup analysis, the effect was more pronounced in elderly people over 85 years of age (3.5%, 95% confidence interval 2.4-4.6) than in 35-64 year-old subjects (0.8%, 95% confidence interval -0.8-2.5), in women (2.2%, 95% confidence interval 1.4-3.1) than in men (0.8%, 95% confidence interval -0.1-1.8), and for out-of-hospital deaths (2.1%, 95% confidence interval 1.0-3.2), especially among diabetics (5.5%, 95% confidence interval 1.4-9.8).

Although the deleterious effects of air pollution from fossil-fuel combustion have been demonstrated in many Western nations, few comparable studies have been conducted in Asia. Time-series studies of daily mortality in Asian cities can contribute important new information to the existing body of knowledge about air pollution and health. Not only can these studies verify important health effects of air pollution in local regions in Asia, they can also help determine the relevance of existing air pollution studies to mortality and morbidity for policymaking and environmental controls. In addition, the studies can help identify factors that might modify associations between air pollution and health effects in various populations and environmental conditions. Collaborative multicity studies in Asia-especially when designed, conducted, and analyzed using a common protocol-will provide more robust air pollution effect estimates for the region as well as relevant, supportable estimates of local adverse health effects needed by environmental and public-health policymakers. SPECIFIC OBJECTIVES: The Public Health and Air Pollution in Asia (PAPA*) project, sponsored by the Health Effects Institute, consisted of four studies designed to assess the effects of air pollution on mortality in four large Asian cities, namely Bangkok, in Thailand, and Hong Kong, Shanghai, and Wuhan, in China. In the PAPA project, a Common Protocol was developed based on methods developed and tested in NMMAPS, APHEA, and time-series studies in the literature to help ensure that the four studies could be compared with each other and with previous studies by following an established protocol. The Common Protocol (found at the end of this volume) is a set of prescriptive instructions developed for the studies and used by the investigators in each city. It is flexible enough to allow for adjustments in methods to optimize the fit of health-effects models to each city's data set. It provides the basis for generating reproducible results in each city and for meta-estimates from combined data. By establishing a common methodology, factors that might influence the differences in results from previous studies can more easily be explored. Administrative support was provided to ensure that the highest quality data were used in the analysis. It is anticipated that the PAPA results will contribute to the international scientific discussion of how to conduct and interpret time-series studies of air pollution and will stimulate the development of high-quality routine systems for recording daily deaths and hospital admissions for time-series analysis.<br /><br /> Mortality data were retrieved from routine databases with underlying causes of death coded using the World Health Organization (WHO) International Classification of Diseases, 9th revision or 10th revision (ICD-9, ICD-10). Air quality measurements included nitrogen dioxide (NO2), sulfur dioxide (SO2), particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter < or = 10 microm (PM10), and ozone (O3) and were obtained from several fixed-site air monitoring stations that were located throughout the metropolitan areas of the four cities and that met the standards of procedures for quality assurance and quality control carried out by local government units in each city. Using the Common Protocol, an optimized core model was established for each city to assess the effects of each of the four air pollutants on daily mortality using generalized linear modeling with adjustments for time trend, seasonality, and other time-varying covariates by means of a natural-spline smoothing function. The models were adjusted to suit local situations by correcting for influenza activity, autocorrelation, and special weather conditions. Researchers in Hong Kong, for example, used influenza activity based on frequency of respiratory mortality; researchers in Hong Kong and Shanghai used autoregressive terms for daily outcomes at lag days; and researchers in Wuhan used additional smoothing for periods with extreme weather conditions.<br /><br /> For mortality due to all natural (nonaccidental) causes at all ages, the effects of air pollutants per 10-microg/m3 increase in concentration was found to be higher in Bangkok than in the three Chinese cities, with the exception of the effect of NO2 in Wuhan. The magnitude of the effects for cardiovascular and respiratory mortality were generally higher than for all natural mortality at all ages. In addition, the effects associated with PM10 and O3 in all natural, cardiovascular; and respiratory mortality were found to be higher in Bangkok than in the three Chinese cities. The explanation for these three findings might be related to consistently higher daily mean temperatures in Bangkok, variations in average time spent outdoors by the susceptible populations, and the fact that less air conditioning is available and used in Bangkok than in the other cities. However, when pollutant concentrations were incorporated into the excess risk estimates through the use of interquartile range (IQR), the excess risk was more comparable across the four cities. We found that the increases in effects among older age groups were greater in Bangkok than in the other three cities. After excluding data on extremely high concentrations of PM10 in Bangkok, the effect estimate associated with PM10 concentrations decreased in Bangkok (suggesting a convex relationship between risk and PM10, where risk levels off at high concentrations) instead of increasing, as it did in the other cities. This leveling off of effect estimates at high concentrations might be related to differences in vulnerability and exposure of the population to air pollution as well as to the sources of the air pollutant. IMPLICATIONS OF THE STUDY: The PAPA project is the first coordinated Asian multicity air pollution study ever published; this signifies the beginning of an era of cooperation and collaboration in Asia, with the development of a common protocol for coordination, data management, and analysis. The results of the study demonstrated that air pollution in Asia is a significant public health burden, especially given the high concentrations of pollutants and high-density populations in major cities. When compared with the effect estimates reported in the research literature of North America and Western Europe, the study's effect estimates for PM10 were generally similar and the effect estimates for gaseous pollutants were relatively higher. In Bangkok, however, a tropical city where total exposures to outdoor pollution might be higher than in most other cities, the observed effects were greater than those reported in the previous (i.e., Western) studies. In general, the results suggested that, even though social and environmental conditions across Asia might vary, it is still generally appropriate to apply to Asia the effect estimates for other health outcomes from previous studies in the West. The results also strongly support the adoption of the global air quality guidelines recently announced by WHO."

Ten highly trained endurance athletes were studied to determine the effects of exposure to low ozone (O3) concentrations on simulated competitive endurance performance and associated physiological and subjective symptom responses. Each subject was randomly exposed to filtered air (FA), and to 0.12, 0.18, and 0.24 ppm O3 while performing a 1 h competitive simulation protocol on a bicycle ergometer. Endurance performance was evaluated by the number of subjects unable to complete rides (last 30 min at an intense work load of ~86% VO2max)- All subjects completed the FA exposure, whereas one, five, and seven subjects did not complete the 0.12, 0.18, and 0.24 ppm O3 exposures, respectively. Statistical analysis indicated a significant (P < 0.05) increase in the inability of subjects to complete the competitive simulations with increasing O3 concentration, including a significant difference between the 0.24 ppm O3 and FA exposure. Significant decreases (P < 0.05) were also observed following the 0.18 and 0.24 ppm O3 exposures, respectively, in forced vital capacity (-7.8 and -9.9%), and forced expiratory volume in 1 s (-5.8 and -10.5%). No significant O3 effect was observed for exercise respiratory metabolism or ventilatory pattern responses. However, the number of reported subjective symtoms increased significantly following the 0.18 and 0.24 ppm O3 protocols. These data demonstrate significant decrements in simulated competitive endurance performance and in pulmonary function, with accompanying enhanced subjective symptoms, following exposure to low O3 levels commonly observed in numerous metropolitan environments during the summer months.

Methods: Five asthmatic adults were exposed for 4 hours to; filtered-air, carbon and ammonium nitrate particles, and particles and ozone. Twenty-minute electrocardiograms were obtained before and after each exposure.

Results: Standard deviation of all normal-to-normal beat intervals (SDNN) decreased significantly across particles and ozone exposure compared with across filtered-air exposure (P = 0.01). Changes in SDNN-I (P = 0.04) and normalized low and high frequency (P = 0.02) were also seen across particles and ozone exposure; although these changes may best be characterized as trends given the small sample size. No significant changes in HRV were seen across the filtered-air or particles-only exposures.

Conclusions: The results of this study suggest that combined particle and ozone exposure may decrease HRV in asthmatics. Further investigation is needed to confirm this finding.

This increase was significantly different (p = 0.017, unadjusted for basal BP) from the small 2-hr change during PFA (median change, 1 mm Hg; 95% CI, -2 to 4; p = 0.24). This prompted further investigation of the CAP+O3 response, which showed a strong association between the 2-hr change in DBP (and mean arterial pressure) and the concentration of the organic carbon fraction of PM2.5 (r = 0.53, p < 0.01; r = 0.56, p < 0.01, respectively) but not with total PM2.5 mass (r < or = 0.25, p > or = 0.27). These findings suggest that exposure to environmentally relevant concentrations of PM2.5 and O3 rapidly increases DBP. The magnitude of BP change is associated with the PM2.5 carbon content.

We found statistically significant associations between air pollution and ventricular arrhythmias for episodes within 3 days of a previous arrhythmia.

Results: Over an average of 1200 days of observation, 705 patients experienced 5462 activation days.

Methods: Thirty two non-smoking older adults were evaluated on a weekly basis for 24 weeks during the summer and autumn of 2000 with a standardised 30 minute protocol that included continuous electrocardiogram measurements. A central ambient monitoring station provided daily concentrations of fine particles (PM2.5, sulfate, elemental carbon) and gases. Sulfate was used as a marker of regional pollution.

Results: Participant specific mean counts of arrhythmia over the protocol varied between 0.1-363 for SVE and 0-350 for VE.

For each participant, the authors calculated PM10 and gaseous pollutant exposures as 24-hour averages and ozone exposure as an 8-hour average 1 day prior to the randomly allocated examination date. They calculated 5-minute heart rate variability indices and used logarithmically transformed data on high-frequency (0.15-0.40 Hz) and low-frequency (0.04-0.15 Hz) power, standard deviation of normal R-R intervals, and mean heart rate. Linear regression was used to adjust for CVD risk factors and demographic, socioeconomic, and meteorologic variables. Regression coefficients for a one-standard-deviation increase in PM10 (11.5 Ag/m3) were -0.06 ms2 (standard error (SE),0.018), -1.03 ms (SE, 0.31), and 0.32 beats/minute (SE, 0.158) for log-transformed high-frequency power, standard deviation of normal R-R intervals, and heart rate, respectively.

To help understand the mechanisms, the types of particles most involved, and the types of persons most susceptible, the association between exposure to summertime air pollution and heart rate variability (HRV) was examined in a panel study of 28 elderly subjects. METHODS: Subjects were seen once a week for up to 12 weeks and HRV (SDNN, r-MSSD, PNN(50), low frequency/high frequency ratio (LFHFR)) was measured for approximately 30 minutes at each session using a defined protocol. Temperature, day of the week, and hour of the day were controlled, and dummy variables for each subject were controlled for subject specific risk factors. RESULTS: PM(2.5) was associated with r-MSSD (-10.1% change for an interquartile range (IQR) increase in exposure (95% CI -2.8 to -16.9)) and PNN(50), but stronger associations were seen with black carbon, an indicator of traffic particles, which was also associated with SDNN (-4.6% per IQR (95% CI -2.0 to -7.2)) and LFHFR. Secondary particles were more weakly associated with r-MSSD, as was ozone. No associations were seen with SO(2) or NO(2). CO had similar patterns of association to black carbon, which disappeared after controlling for black carbon. Black carbon had a substantially higher effect on SDNN in subjects who had had a previous myocardial infarction (-12.7%, 95% CI -5.7 to -19.25). CONCLUSIONS: Particles, especially from traffic, are associated with disturbances of autonomic control of the heart."

We hypothesized that pollution originating in different locations has different associations with heart rate variability (HRV) among 497 men from the Normative Aging Study in Boston, Massachusetts. We identified the paths that air masses traveled ('back-trajectories') before arriving in Boston on the days the men were examined. Next, we classified these trajectories into six clusters. We examined whether the association of measured air pollutants with HRV (standard deviation of normal-to-normal intervals, high-frequency power (HF) and low-frequency power (LF), and LF/HF ratio) differed by cluster. We also examined whether the clusters alone (not considering air pollution measurements) showed different associations with HRV. The effects of black carbon (BC) on all HRV measures were strongest on days with southwest trajectories. Subjects who were examined on days where air parcels came from west had the strongest associations with ozone. All particle pollutants (particulate matter <2.5 m in aerodynamic diameter (PM2.5), BC, and sulfates) were associated with increased LF/HF ratio on days with relatively short trajectories, which are related to local, slow-moving air masses. We also observed significant increases in LF/HF in days where air came from the northwest and west, compared to north trajectory days. Health effects associated with exposure to air pollution can be evaluated using pollutant concentrations as well as aspects of the pollution mixture captured by identifying locations where air masses originate. Independent effects of both these indicators of pollution exposure were seen on cardiac autonomic function."

METHODS: We examined whether higher cumulative lead exposures, as measured by bone lead, modified cross-sectional associations between air pollution and heart rate variability among 384 elderly men from the Normative Aging Study. We used linear regression, controlling for clinical, demographic, and environmental covariates. RESULTS: We found graded, significant reductions in both high-frequency and low-frequency powers of heart rate variability in relation to ozone and sulfate across the quartiles of tibia lead. Interquartile range increases in ozone and sulfate were associated respectively, with 38% decrease (95% confidence interval = -54.6% to -14.9%) and 22% decrease (-40.4% to 1.6%) in high frequency, and 38% decrease (-51.9% to -20.4%) and 12% decrease (-28.6% to 9.3%) in low frequency, in the highest quartile of tibia lead after controlling for potential confounders. We observed similar but weaker effect modification by tibia lead adjusted for education and cumulative traffic (residuals of the regression of tibia lead on education and cumulative traffic). Patella lead modified only the ozone effect on heart rate variability. CONCLUSIONS: People with long-term exposure to higher levels of lead may be more sensitive to cardiac autonomic dysfunction on high air pollution days. Efforts to understand how environmental exposures affect the health of an aging population should consider both current levels of pollution and history of lead exposure as susceptibility factors."

Objectives: We examined the effects of air pollutants on heart-rate?corrected QT interval (QTc), an electrocardiographic marker of ventricular repolarization, and whether these associations were modified by participant characteristics and genetic polymorphisms related to oxidative stress.

Methods: We studied repeated measurements of QTc on 580 men from the Veterans Affairs Normative Aging Study (NAS) using mixed-effects models with random intercepts. We fitted a quadratic constrained distributed lag model to estimate the cumulative effect on QTc of ambient air pollutants including fine particulate matter ? 2.5 ?m in aerodynamic diameter (PM2.5), ozone (O3), black carbon (BC), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), carbon monoxide (CO), and sulfur dioxide (SO2) concentrations during the 10 hr before the visit. We genotyped polymorphisms related to oxidative stress and analyzed pollution?susceptibility score interactions using the genetic susceptibility score (GSS) method.

Results: Ambient traffic pollutant concentrations were related to longer QTc. An interquartile range (IQR) change in BC cumulative during the 10 hr before the visit was associated with increased QTc [1.89 msec change; 95% confidence interval (CI), ?0.16 to 3.93]. We found a similar association with QTc for an IQR change in 1-hr BC that occurred 4 hr before the visit (2.54 msec change; 95% CI, 0.28?4.80). We found increased QTc for IQR changes in NO2 and CO, but the change was statistically insignificant. In contrast, we found no association between QTc and PM2.5, SO2, and O3. The association between QTc and BC was stronger among participants who were obese, who had diabetes, who were nonsmokers, or who had higher GSSs.

Conclusions: Traffic-related pollutants may increase QTc among persons with diabetes, persons who are obese, and nonsmoking elderly individuals; the number of genetic variants related to oxidative stress increases this effect."

We examined the effects of ambient pollution on HRV for 18 individuals with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and 12 individuals with recent myocardial infarction (MI) living in Atlanta, Georgia. HRV, baseline pulmonary function, and medication data were collected for each participant on 7 days in fall 1999 and/or spring 2000. Hourly ambient pollution concentrations were obtained from monitoring sites in Atlanta. The association between ambient pollution and HRV was examined using linear mixed-effect models. Ambient pollution had opposing effects on HRV in our COPD and MI participants, resulting in no significant effect of ambient pollution on HRV in the entire population for 1-, 4-, or 24-hr moving averages. For individuals with COPD, interquartile range (IQR) increases in 4-hr ambient PM2.5 (11.65 microg/m3)) and nitrogen dioxide (11.97 ppb) were associated with 8.3% [95% confidence interval (CI), 1.7-15.3%] and 7.7% (95% CI, 0.1-15.9%) increase in the SD of normal R-R intervals (SDNN), respectively. For individuals with MI, IQR increases in 4-hr PM2.5 (8.54 microg/m3) and NO2 (9.25 ppb) were associated with a nonsignificant 2.9% (95% CI, -7.8 to 2.3) and significant 12.1 (95% CI, -19.5 to -4.0) decrease in SDNN. Beta-blocker and bronchodilator intake and baseline forced expiratory volume in 1 sec modified the PM-SDNN association significantly, with effects consistent with those by disease group.

Possible mechanisms include autonomic cardiac dysfunction.Methods: In a repeated-measures study of 46 patients 4375 years of age, we investigated associations of central-site ambient particulate pollution, including black carbon (BC) (a marker for regional and local traffic), and report of traffic exposure with changes in half-hourly averaged heart rate variability (HRV), a marker of autonomic function measured by 24-hr Holter electrocardiogram monitoring. Each patient was observed up to four times within 1 year after a percutaneous intervention for myocardial infarction, acute coronary syndrome without infarction, or stable coronary artery disease (4,955 half-hour observations). For each half-hour period, diary data defined whether the patient was home or not home, or in traffic.Results: A decrease in high frequency (HF; an HRV marker of vagal tone) of 16.4% [95% confidence interval (CI), 20.7 to 11.8%] was associated with an interquartile range of 0.3-microg/m3 increase in prior 5-day averaged ambient BC. Decreases in HF were independently associated both with the previous 2-hr averaged BC (10.4%; 95% CI, 15.4 to 5.2%) and with being in traffic in the previous 2 hr (38.5%; 95% CI, 57.4 to 11.1%). We also observed independent responses for particulate air matter with aerodynamic diameter </= 2.5 microm and for gases (ozone or nitrogen dioxide).Conclusion: After hospitalization for coronary artery disease, both particulate pollution and being in traffic, a marker of stress and pollution, were associated with decreased HRV. Editor's SummaryReduced heart rate variability (HRV) has been associated with myocardial infarction and mortality in heart failure patients, and acute decreases in HRV have been reported to precede ischemic events and paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. Associations of particulate matter (PM) and traffic-related air pollution with myocardial infarction and cardiac mortality may be related to effects on HRV, but inconsistent findings of previous studies suggest that susceptibility to effects of pollution on HRV may vary. Zanobetti et al. (p. 324) estimated associations between ambient air pollution [PM and black carbon (BC) measured at a central site], self-reported traffic exposure, and several markers of HRV (measured by Holter electrocardiogram monitoring over 24 hr) among 46 patients observed up to four times within the year following percutaneous intervention for myocardial infarction, acute coronary syndrome without infarction, or stable coronary artery disease. The authors report a decrease in high frequency measures with an increase in prior 5-day averaged ambient BC, increased BC within the previous 2 hr, and being in traffic within the previous 2 hr. Model estimates also suggested independent effects of PM with aerodynamic diameter </= 2.5 microm, ozone, and nitrogen dioxide, and stronger associations among patients with type 2 diabetes. They conclude that findings support existing evidence of adverse effects of ambient air pollution and traffic exposure on HRV, and underscore the need to consider susceptible populations when setting air quality standards."

Changes in the autonomic nervous system may contribute to cardiac arrhythmias and cardiovascular mortality. This study investigated the relations between air pollutant concentrations of sulphur dioxide (SO2), ozone (O2), nitric dioxide (NO2), and resting heart rate (RHR) in a population based study. METHODS: A sample of 863 middle aged men and women, living in Toulouse (MONICA centre) area, was randomly recruited. A cross sectional survey on cardiovascular risk factors was carried. RHR was measured twice in a sitting position after a five minute rest. Multivariate analyses with quintiles of RHR were performed using polytomous logistic regression. Models were adjusted for temperature, season, relative humidity, sex, physical activity, blood pressure, C reactive protein, and cardiovascular drugs. RESULTS: For NO2, the OR (odds ratio) (95% CI) associated with an increase of 5 microg/m(3) in the current day of medical examination was 1.14 (1.03 to 1.25) in quintile Q5 of RHR compared with Q1, p for trend = 0.003. For SO2, OR was 1.16 (0.94 to 1.44) in Q5 compared with Q1, p for trend = 0.05, and for O2, OR was 0.96 (0.91 to 1.01) in Q5 compared with Q1, p for trend = 0.11. No significant association was seen when the daily mean concentration of NO2, SO2, and O2 was considered during the previous day as well as when day lag 2 or 3 was considered. The cumulative concentration (three consecutive days) of O2 is negatively associated with RHR (p for trend = 0.02). CONCLUSION: Changes in pulse rate could reflect cardiac rhythm changes and may be part of the pathophysiological link between pollution and cardiovascular mortality."

We investigated the effects of ozone on heart rate (HR) and repolarisation parameters in potentially susceptible populations.
Methods: Between March 2007 and December 2008, 363 ECG recordings including >2000 1 h intervals were measured in 64 individuals with type 2 diabetes or impaired glucose tolerance and in 46 healthy individuals with a potential genetic predisposition on the detoxification pathways from Augsburg, Germany. Associations between 1 h averages of ozone and HR, Bazett-corrected QT-interval (QTc), T-wave amplitude and T-wave complexity were analysed using additive mixed models. A variable indicating season and participants' location during the 1 h ECG recordings (summer and outdoors vs winter or indoors) was used as a potential ozone effect modifier.
Results: We observed concurrent and 1-4 h lagged increases in HR of 0.5-0.7% for each 20 ?g/m(3) increase in ozone. These effects were stronger (1.0-1.2%) when participants were outdoors during the summer. We detected in all participants a concurrent (-1.31%; 95% CI -2.19% to -0.42%) and 1 h lagged (-1.32%; -2.19% to -0.45%) T-wave flattening. Elevated ozone levels were associated with 1 h (2.12%; 0.81 to 3.52) and 2 h lagged (1.89%; 0.55% to 3.26%) increases in T-wave complexity. However, no effects were seen for QTc. Ozone effects were generally more pronounced in individuals with metabolic disorders than a potential genetic predisposition.
Conclusions: Changes in repolarisation might contribute to underlying pathophysiological changes associated with the link between elevated ozone levels and reported adverse cardiovascular outcomes."

Personal ozone and size-fractionated particulate matter exposures were monitored during working hours while carriers delivered mail outdoors. Cardiovascular effects were evaluated with heart rate variability (HRV) indices and an arterial stiffness index, the cardio-ankle vascular index (CAVI). The authors used linear mixed models to examine the association between personal exposure data and the HRV index and CAVI. They found that an interquartile range increase in personal exposure to ozone and particulate matter of between 1.0 and 2.5 mum was associated with a 4.8% and 2.5% increase in CAVI, respectively, in the single-pollutant models. In contrast, the personal exposure data showed no significant effects on HRV. In 2-pollutant models, personal ozone exposure remained significantly associated with the CAVI measurements.

Objectives: To investigate whether biological mechanisms linking air pollution to cardiovascular events occurred concurrently in human subjects exposed to urban air pollutants. 

Methods: We recruited a panel of 76 young, healthy students from a university in Taipei. Between April and June of 2004 or 2005, three measurements were made in each participant of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG), plasminogen activator fibrinogen inhibitor-1 (PAI-1), tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA) in plasma, and heart rate variability (HRV). Gaseous air pollutants were measured at one air-monitoring station inside their campus, and particulate air pollutants were measured at one particulate matter supersite monitoring station 1 km from their campus. We used linear mixed-effects models to associate biological endpoints with individual air pollutants averaged over 1- to 3-day periods before measurements were performed. 

Measurements and Main Results: We found that increases in hs-CRP, 8-OHdG, fibrinogen, and PAI-1, and decreases in HRV indices were associated with increases in levels of particles with aerodynamic diameters less than 10 Am and 2.5 Am, sulfate, nitrate, and ozone (O3) in single-pollutant models. The increase in 8-OHdG, fibrinogen, and PAI-1, and the reduction in HRV remained significantly associated with 3-day averaged sulfate and O3 levels in two-pollutant models. There were moderate correlations (r = -0.3) between blood markers of hs-CRP, fibrinogen, PAI-1, and HRV indices. 

Conclusions: Urban air pollution is associated with inflammation, oxidative stress, blood coagulation and autonomic dysfunction simultaneously in healthy young humans, with sulfate and O3 as two major traffic-related pollutants contributing to such effects."

The objective of this study was to investigate the association between short-term exposure to ambient air pollution and risk for ischemic cerebrovascular events in a US community.<br /><br /><strong>METHODS: </strong>Daily counts of ischemic strokes/transient ischemic attacks (TIAs) (2001-2005) were obtained from the population-based Brain Attack Surveillance in Corpus Christi (BASIC) Project. Daily particulate matter less than 2.5microm in diameter (PM(2.5)), ozone (O(3)), and meteorological data were obtained from Texas Commission on Environmental Quality. To examine the association between PM(2.5) and stroke/TIA risk, we used Poisson regression. Separate models included same-day PM(2.5), PM(2.5) lagged 1 to 5 days, and an averaged lag effect. All models were adjusted for temperature, day of week, and temporal trends in stroke/TIA.

The register recorded all first-ever strokes among residents of Dillon (150 000 inhabitants) in France, using standard diagnostic criteria. Pollutant concentrations (SO2, CO, NO2, O-3 and PM10) were measured hourly. A bi-directional case-crossover design was used to examine the association between air pollutant and stroke onset. The conditional logistic regression model included the meteorological parameters (temperature, relative humidity), influenza epidemics and holidays.Results: The authors collected 493 large artery infarcts, 397 small artery infarcts, 530 cardio-embolic infarcts, 67 undeterminate infarcts, 371 transient ischaemic attacks and 220 haemorrhagic strokes. For single-pollutant model and for a 10 mg/m(3) increase of 03 exposure, a positive association was observed only in men, over 40 years of age, between ischaemic stroke occurrence and O-3 levels with 1 -day lag, (OR 1.133, 95% Cl 1.052 to 1.220) and 0-day lag (OR 1.058, 95% Cl 0.987 to 1.134). No significant associations were found for haemorrhagic stroke. In two-pollutant models, the effects Of O-3 remained significant after each of the other pollutants were included in the model, in particular with PM10. A significant association was observed for ischaemic strokes of large arteries (p = 0.02) and for transient ischaemic attacks (p =0.01). Moreover, the authors found an exposure- response relations between O-3 exposure and ischaemic stroke (test for trend, p = 0.01).

Methods: Daily levels of urban O3 pollution, the incidence of first-ever, recurrent, fatal and non-fatal ischaemic cerebrovascular events (ICVE) and myocardial infarction (MI) were correlated using a case-crossover design. The authors analysed 1574 ICVE and 913 MI that occurred in Dijon, France (150?000 inhabitants) from 2001 to 2007. Sulfur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), carbon monoxide (CO) and particulate matter with an aerodiameter of ?10??g/m3 (PM10) were used to create bi-pollutant models. Using the adjusted OR, the effects of O3 exposure were calculated for every 10??g/m3 increase in pollutants in multivariate logistic models adjusted for temperature, humidity, flu outbreaks and holidays.

Results: The authors found a significant association between exposure to O3 and recurrent ICVE with a 3-day lag (OR=1.115; 95% CI 1.027 to 1.209). The direction and magnitude of the association between exposure to O3 and recurrent MI were similar but not statistically significant. For incident events, the authors detected only a non-significant association for ICVE with a 2-day lag (OR=1.041; 95% CI 0.996 to 1.089). In the subgroup analysis for ICVE, the authors observed an increased association with cardiovascular risk factors (OR=1.523; 95% CI 1.149 to 2.018). For MI, the authors found an association with O3 when hypercholesterolaemia was present (OR=1.111; 95% CI 1.020 to 1.211), and the association became stronger with the number of cardiovascular risk factors.

For each participant, we calculated the following pollutant exposures 1-3 days prior to the randomly allocated cohort examination date: PM(10), CO, NO(2), and SO(2) as 24-h averages, and O(3) as an 8-h average of the hourly measures. The hemostatic/inflammatory factors included fibrinogen, factor VIII-C, von Willebrand factor (vWF), albumin, and white blood cell count (WBC). Linear regression models were used to adjust for cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors, demographic and socioeconomic variables, and relevant meteorological variables. One standard deviation (SD) increment of PM(10) (12.8 microg/m(3)) was significantly (P < 0.05) associated with 3.93% higher of vWF among diabetics and 0.006 g/dl lower of serum albumin among persons with a history of CVD.

Interleukin-6 (IL-6) and fibrinogen are biomarkers of systemic inflammation that are independent risk factors for cardio-vascular disease.

OBJECTIVE: We investigated the association between ambient air pollution and systemic inflammation using baseline measurements of IL-6 and fibrinogen from controlled human exposure studies.

METHODS: In this retrospective analysis we used repeated-measures data in 45 nonsmoking subjects. Hourly and daily moving averages were calculated for ozone, nitrogen dioxide, sulfur dioxide, and particulate matter <or= 2.5 microm in aerodynamic diameter (PM2.5). Linear mixed-model regression determined the effects of the pollutants on systemic IL-6 and fibrinogen. Effect modification by season was considered.

RESULTS: We observed a positive association between IL-6 and O3 [0.31 SD per O3 interquartile range (IQR); 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.080.54] and between IL-6 and SO2 (0.25 SD per SO2 IQR; 95% CI, 0.060.43). We observed the strongest effects using 4-day moving averages. Responses to pollutants varied by season and tended to be higher in the summer, particularly for O3 and PM2.5. Fibrinogen was not associated with pollution.

CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates a significant association between ambient pollutant levels and baseline levels of systemic IL-6. These findings have potential implications for controlled human exposure studies. Future research should consider whether ambient pollution exposure before chamber exposure modifies IL-6 response."

Underlying biological mechanisms are not entirely clear, and hemostasis and inflammation are suggested to be involved. 

OBJECTIVES: Our aim was to study the association of the variation in local concentrations of airborne particulate matter (PM) with aerodynamic diameter < 10 mum, carbon monoxide, nitrogen monoxide, nitrogen dioxide, and ozone with platelet aggregation, thrombin generation, fibrinogen, and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels in healthy individuals. 

METHODS: From 40 healthy volunteers, we collected 13 consecutive blood samples within a 1-year period and measured light-transmittance platelet aggregometry, thrombin generation, fibrinogen, and CRP. We performed regression analysis using generalized additive models to study the association between the hemostatic and inflammatory variables, and local environmental concentrations of air pollutants for time lags within 24 hr before blood sampling or 24-96 hr before blood sampling. 

RESULTS: In general, air pollutants were associated with platelet aggregation [average, +8% per interquartile range (IQR), p < 0.01] and thrombin generation (average, +1% per IQR, p < 0.05). Platelet aggregation was not affected by in vitro incubation of plasma with PM. We observed no relationship between any of the air pollutants and fibrinogen or CRP levels. 

CONCLUSIONS: Air pollution increased platelet aggregation as well as coagulation activity but had no clear effect on systemic inflammation. These prothrombotic effects may partly explain the relationship between air pollution and the risk of ischemic cardiovascular disease."

Studies using administrative data report a positive association between ambient air pollution and the risk of hospitalization for congestive heart failure (HF). Circulating levels of B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) are directly associated with cardiac hemodynamics and symptom severity in patients with HF and, therefore, serves as a marker of functional status. We tested the hypothesis that BNP levels would be positively associated with short-term changes in ambient pollution levels among 28 patients with chronic stable HF and impaired systolic function.
Methods
BNP was measured in whole blood at 0, 6, and 12 weeks. We used linear mixed models to evaluate the association between fine particulate matter (PM2.5), carbon monoxide, sulfur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide, ozone, and black carbon and log(BNP). Lags of 0 to 3 days were considered in separate models. We calculated the intraclass correlation coefficient and within-subject coefficient of variation as measures of reproducibility.
Results
We found no association between any pollutant and measures of BNP at any lag. For example, a 10 Ag/m3 increase in PM2.5 was associated with a 0.8% (95% CI: -16.4, 21.5; p = 0.94) increase in BNP on the same day. The within-subject coefficient of variation was 45% on the natural scale and 9% on the log scale.
Conclusion
These results suggest that serial BNP measurements are unlikely to be useful in a longitudinal study of air pollution-related acute health effects. The magnitude of expected ambient air pollution health effects appears small in relation to the considerable within-person variability in BNP levels in this population."

This daily diary panel study in Montreal, Quebec, was carried out to determine whether oxygen saturation and pulse rate were associated with selected personal factors, weather conditions and air pollution.

Methods: Thirty-one subjects with CHF participated in this study in 2002 and 2003. Over a 2-month period, the investigators measured their oxygen saturation, pulse rate, weight and temperature each morning and recorded these and other data in a daily diary. Air pollution and weather conditions were obtained from fixed-site monitoring stations. The study made use of mixed regression models, adjusting for within-subject serial correlation and temporal trends, to determine the association between oxygen saturation and pulse rate and personal and environmental variables. Depending on the model, we accounted for the effects of a variety of personal variables (eg, body temperature, salt consumption) as well as nitrogen dioxide (NO2), ozone, maximum temperature and change in barometric pressure at 8:00 from the previous day.

Results: In multivariable analyses, the study found that oxygen saturation was reduced when subjects reported that they were ill, consumed salt, or drank liquids on the previous day and had higher body temperatures on the concurrent day (only the latter was statistically significant). Relative humidity and decreased atmospheric pressure from the previous day were associated with oxygen saturation. In univariate analyses, there was negative associations with concentrations of fine particulates, ozone, and sulphur dioxide (SO2), but only SO2 was significant after adjustment for the effects of weather. For pulse rate, no associations were found for the personal variables and in univariate analyses the study found positive associations with NO2, fine particulates (aerodynamic diameter of 2.5 ?m or under, PM2.5), SO2, and maximum temperature, although only the latter two were significant after adjustment for environmental effects.

Conclusions: The findings from the present investigation suggest that personal and environmental conditions affect intermediate physiological parameters that may affect the health of CHF patients."

The objective of this study was to test the associations between air pollutants and the occurrence of acute myocardial infarction (AMI). METHODS AND RESULTS: Pollutant concentrations (SO2, NO2, and O3) were measured hourly as part of the automated air quality network. Since 1985, an AMI registry (the Toulouse MONICA Project) has been collecting data in the southwest of France. All cases of AMI and sudden and probable cardiac deaths are recorded for subjects 35 to 64 years of age. We studied the short-term exposure effect of pollution on the risk of AMI (from January 1, 1997, to June 30, 1999) using a case-crossover design method. We performed a conditional logistic regression analysis to calculate relative risks (RRs) and their 95% CIs. After adjustment for temperature, relative humidity, and influenza epidemics, the RRs (for an increase of 5 microg/m3 of O3 concentration) for AMI occurrence were significant for the current-day and 1-day-lag measurements (RR, 1.05; 95% CI, 1.01 to 1.08; P=0.009; and RR, 1.05; 95% CI, 1.01 to 1.09; P=0.007, respectively). Subjects 55 to 64 years of age with no personal history of ischemic heart disease were the most susceptible to develop an AMI (RR, 1.14; 95% CI, 1.06 to 1.23). NO2 and SO2 exposures were not significantly associated with the occurrence of AMI. CONCLUSIONS: Observational data confirm that short-term O3 exposure within a period of 1 to 2 days is related to acute coronary events in middle-aged adults without heart disease, whereas NO2 and SO2 are not."

Whether high concentrations of ambient particles can trigger the onset of acute myocardial infarction (MI), however, remains unknown. Methods and Results-We interviewed 772 patients with MI in the greater Boston area between January 1995 and May 1996 as part of the Determinants of Myocardial Infarction Onset Study. Hourly concentrations of particle mass <2.5 ""mu""m (PM2.5), carbon black, and gaseous air pollutants were measured. A case-crossover approach was used to analyze the data for evidence of triggering. The risk of MI onset increased in association with elevated concentrations of fine particles in the previous 2-hour period. In addition, a delayed response associated with 24-hour average exposure 1 day before the onset of symptoms was observed. Multivariate analyses considering both time windows jointly revealed an estimated odds ratio of I .48 associated with an increase of 25 ""mu""g/m3 PM2.5 during a 2-hour period before the onset and an odds ratio of 1.69 for an increase of 20 ""mu""g/m3 PM2.5 in the 24-hour period 1 day before the onset (95% CIs 1.09, 2.02 and 1.13, 2.34, respectively). Conclusions-The present study suggests that elevated concentrations of fine particles in the air may transiently elevate the risk of MIs within a few hours and 1 day after exposure.

Objectives: We hypothesized that acute increases in fine PM (PM2.5) would be associated with increased risk of MI and that chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and diabetes would confer increased susceptibility to PM2.5. We also explored whether both transmural and non-transmural infarctions were acutely associated with ambient PM2.5 concentrations. Methods: We studied all hospital admissions for first acute MI (2004-2006) of adult residents of New Jersey, living within 10km of a PM2.5 monitoring site (N=5864), and ambient measurements of PM2.5, nitrogen dioxide, sulfur dioxide, carbon monoxide, and ozone. Results: Using a time-stratified case-crossover design and conditional logistic regression, each interquartile increase in PM2.5 concentration (10 microg/m3) in the 24 hours before emergency room arrival for MI was not associated with an increased risk of MI overall, but was associated with increased risk of a transmural infarction. There was no association between the same increase in PM2.5 and risk of a non-transmural infarction. Further, subjects with COPD appeared to be particularly susceptible, but not subjects with diabetes. Conclusions: This PM/transmural infarction association is consistent with earlier studies of PM and total MI.

We previously found that markers of primary (combustion-related) organic aerosols and gases were positively associated with circulating biomarkers of inflammation and ambulatory blood pressure in the present cohort panel study of elderly subjects with coronary artery disease.

Objectives: We specifically aimed to evaluate whether exposure markers of primary organic aerosols and ultrafine particles were more strongly associated with ST-segment depression of ? 1 mm than were secondary organic aerosols or PM2.5 (particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter ? 2.5 ?m) mass.

Methods: We evaluated relations of air pollutants to ambulatory electrocardiographic evidence of cardiac ischemia over 10 days in 38 subjects without ST depression on baseline electrocardiographs. Exposures were measured outdoors in retirement communities in the Los Angeles basin, including daily size-fractionated particle mass and hourly markers of primary and secondary organic aerosols and gases. Generalized estimating equations were used to estimate odds of hourly ST-segment depression (? 1 mm) from hourly air pollution exposures and to estimate relative rates of daily counts of ST-segment depression from daily average exposures, controlling for potential confounders.

Results: We found significant positive associations of hourly ST-segment depression with markers ?of combustion-related aerosols and gases averaged 1-hr through 3-4 days, but not secondary (photochemically aged) organic aerosols or ozone. The odds ratio per interquartile increase in 2-day average primary organic carbon (5.2 ?g/m3) was 15.4 (95% confidence interval, 3.5-68.2). Daily counts of ST-segment depression were consistently associated with primary combustion markers and 2-day average quasi-ultrafine particles < 0.25 ?m.

Conclusions: Results suggest that exposure to quasi-ultrafine particles and combustion-related pollutants (predominantly from traffic) increase the risk of myocardial ischemia, coherent with our previous findings for systemic inflammation and blood pressure."

We investigated the associations between fine particulate pollution (PM2.5) and blood pressure during 631 repeated visits for cardiac rehabilitation in 62 Boston residents with cardiovascular disease. METHODS AND RESULTS: Blood pressure, cardiac risk factor, and exercise data were abstracted from records of rehabilitation visits between 1999 and 2001. We applied mixed-effect models, controlling for body mass index, age, gender, number of visits, hour of day, and weather variables. For an increase from the 10th to the 90th percentile in mean PM2.5 level during the 5 days before the visit (10.5 microg/m3), there was a 2.8-mm Hg (95% CI, 0.1 to 5.5) increase in resting systolic, a 2.7-mm Hg (95% CI, 1.2 to 4.3) increase in resting diastolic, and a 2.7-mm Hg (95% CI, 1.0 to 4.5) increase in resting mean arterial blood pressure. The mean PM2.5 level during the 2 preceding days (13.9 microg/m3) was associated with a 7.0-mm Hg (95% CI, 2.3 to 12.1) increase in diastolic and a 4.7-mm Hg (95% CI, 0.5 to 9.1) increase in mean arterial blood pressure during exercise in persons with resting heart rate > or =70 bpm, but it was not associated with an increase in blood pressure during exercise in persons with heart rate <70 bpm. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with preexisting cardiac disease, particle pollution may contribute to increased risk of cardiac morbidity and mortality through short-term increases in systemic arterial vascular narrowing, as manifested by increased peripheral blood pressure."

No studies have used ambulatory BP monitoring and outdoor home air-pollutant measurements with time-activity-location data. We address these gaps in a study of 64 elderly subjects with coronary artery disease, living in retirement communities in the Los Angeles basin.

Methods: Subjects were followed up for 10 days with hourly waking ambulatory BP monitoring (n = 6539 total measurements), hourly electronic diaries for perceived exertion and location, and real-time activity monitors (actigraphs). We measured hourly outdoor home pollutant gases, particle number, PM2.5, organic carbon, and black carbon. Data were analyzed with mixed models controlling for temperature, posture, actigraph activity, hour, community, and season.

Results: We found positive associations of systolic and diastolic BP with air pollutants. The strongest associations were with organic carbon (especially its estimated fossil-fuel- combustion fraction), multiday average exposures, and time periods when subjects were at home. An interquartile increase in 5-day average organic carbon (5.2 ?g/m3) was associated with 8.2 mm Hg higher mean systolic BP (95% confidence interval = 3.0?13.4) and 5.8 mm Hg higher mean diastolic BP (3.0?8.6). Associations of BP with 1?8 hour average air pollution were stronger with reports of moderate to strenuous physical exertion but not with higher actigraph motion. Associations were also stronger among 12 obese subjects.

Conclusions: Exposure to primary organic components of fossil fuel combustion near the home were strongly associated with increased ambulatory BP in a population at potential risk of heart attack. Low fitness or obesity may increase the effects of pollutants."

Results: In the warm-weather season (July?September), particulate air pollutant of <10 ?m (PM10) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) concentrations were significantly associated with measures of blood pressure. During cold weather (October?December), blood pressure was significantly associated with sulphur dioxide (SO2) and ozone (O3) concentrations.

Visits for cardiovascular disease were examined in relation to levels of ambient pollutants by use of a case-crossover framework. Heterogeneity of risk was examined for several comorbid conditions. The results included evidence of stronger associations of dysrhythmia and congestive heart failure visits with comorbid hypertension in relation to increased air pollution levels compared with visits without comorbid hypertension; similar evidence of effect modification by diabetes and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) was observed for dysrhythmia and peripheral and cerebrovascular disease visits, respectively. Evidence of effect modification by comorbid hypertension and diabetes was observed in relation to particulate matter less than 10 Am in aerodynamic diameter, nitrogen dioxide, and carbon monoxide, while evidence of effect modification by comorbid COPD was also observed in response to ozone levels.

Results: Percentage increases in hospitalization associated with an increase in air pollution equivalent to its mean value were statistically significant for ozone, carbon monoxide and nitrogen dioxide individually (P < 0.05) and the combined pollutant effect was 8.5% (95% confidence interval: 1.8, 14.6). The air pollution-cardiac disease association was not significantly influenced by gender or community level of education or income.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study concerned 10,881 ED visits for acute ischemic stroke (ICD-9: 434, 436) recorded at Edmonton hospitals between 1992 and 2002. Generalized linear mixed models technique was applied to build the statistical models. The logarithm of daily counts of ED visits for stroke was regressed on the levels of air pollutants (CO, NO2, SO2, and O3) and two meteorological variables. The analyses were performed by (a) age: two age groups were distinguished: 20-64 years (n=2873) and 65-100 years (n=8008); (b) season (all seasons: January-December, warm: April-September, cold: October-March); and (c) gender (both, male, female). 

RESULTS: The results are reported as an excess risk in relation to an increase in the interquartile range (IQR) of the pollutants. In the age group 65-100 years, the excess risk for particular pollutants was as follows: for NO2-8.2% (95% CI: 0.4-16.7) for both genders, in the warm season; for SO2-9.1% (95% CI: 2.2-16.4), for males, in the warm season: for a 1-day lagged SO2-6.0% (95% CI: 0.5-11.8), for females, in the cold season. Among the patients aged 20-64 years, the excess risk for NO2 was 6.3% (95% CI: 0.2-12.8), for both genders, and all seasons; and 13.8% (95% CI: 2.1-26.7), for females, in the cold season; for a 1-day lagged O3-17.8% (95% CI: 2.2-35.6), for males, in the warm season; for a 1-day lagged SO2-10.3% (95% CI: 0.7-20.9) for females, in the cold season.

We undertook a time-stratified case-crossover study to evaluate associations between outdoor air pollution and emergency department visits for stroke among the elderly according to stroke type, season, and sex. Analyses are based on a total of 12,422 stroke visits among those 65 years of age and older in Edmonton, Canada between April 1, 1992 and March 31, 2002. Daily air pollution levels for SO2, NO2, PM2.5, PM10, CO and O3 were estimated using data from fixed-site monitoring stations. Particulate matter data were only available from 1998 onwards. Conditional logistic regression was used to estimate the odds ratios (ORs) and their 95% confidence intervals in relation to an increase in the interquartile range (IQR) of each pollutant. ORs were adjusted for the effects of temperature and relative humidity. We found no association between outdoor measures of air pollution and all stroke visits. In contrast, elevated risks were observed between levels of air pollution and acute ischemic stroke between April and September. During this season, the ORs associated with an increase in the IQR of the 3-day average for CO and NO2 were 1.32 (95% CI = 1.09-1.60) and 1.26 (95% CI = 1.09-1.46), respectively. CO exposures in the same season, lagged 1 day, were associated with an increased risk of hemorrhagic stroke with ORs was 1.20 (95% CI = 1.00-1.43). Our results suggest it is possible that vehicular traffic, which produces increased levels of NO2 and CO, contributes to an increased incidence of emergency department visits for stroke."

The authors evaluated the association between exposure to particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter of <2.5 microm (PM2.5) and onset of symptom exacerbation leading to hospital admission in Baltimore, Maryland. They used a case-crossover design for 135 case events occurring among 125 persons with prevalent congestive heart failure who were admitted to a single hospital through the emergency department during 2002. The case period was assigned using three index times: 8-hour and 24-hour periods of symptom onset and date of hospital admission. Controlling for weather, the authors detected a modest relative increase in risk for cases defined by 8-hour symptom onset for an interquartile-range increase in PM2.5 at a 2-day lag (odds ratio=1.09, 95% confidence interval: 0.91, 1.30). A corresponding increase in risk was not observed when admission date was used to define the case period. A series of simulations based on study data indicated that the study had adequate statistical power to detect odds ratios of 1.2 or higher. Although overall findings were not statistically significant, the identification of case events defined by an 8-hour onset period may be more relevant than either a 24-hour onset period or the admission date for estimating harmful effects of air pollutant exposure on cardiovascular health.

In single-pollutant models, particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter of <10 microm (PM(10)), carbon monoxide, nitrogen dioxide, and sulfur dioxide-but not ozone-were positively and significantly associated with the rate of admission on the same day. The strongest associations were observed with carbon monoxide, nitrogen dioxide, and PM(10). The associations with carbon monoxide and nitrogen dioxide were the most robust in two-pollutant models, remaining statistically significant even after adjusting for other pollutants. Patients with a recent myocardial infarction were at greater risk of particulate-related admission; otherwise, there was no significant effect modification by age, gender, or other secondary diagnoses. These results suggest that short-term elevations in air pollution from traffic-related sources may trigger acute cardiac decompensation in heart failure patients and that those with certain comorbid conditions may be more susceptible to these effects."

The issue is of particular importance due to the frequency, intensity, and health effects of Asian sandstorms. This work investigates the relationship between cause-specific hospital admissions and sandstorms and air pollution in Taipei, Taiwan's capital. METHODS: Time-series analyses of asthma, pneumonia, ischemic heart disease, and cerebrovascular disease hospital admissions were performed for Taipei. An 8-year time period (1995-2002) was considered for various indicators of sandstorms and the pollutants NO2, CO, ozone, SO2, PM10, and PM2.5. Pollution effects based on single-day lags of 0, 1, 2, and 3 days were explored, along with the average of the same day and previous three days (L03). RESULTS: The risk of ischemic heart disease admissions was associated with several sandstorm metrics, including indicators of high PM10 levels in the Taipei area, indicators of high PM10 at a monitor designed to measure background pollution, the PM coarse fraction, and the ratio of PM10 to PM2.5. However, the lag structure of effect was not consistent across sandstorm indicators. Hospital admissions for this disease were 16 to 21% higher on sandstorm days compared to other days. This cause was also associated with transportation-related pollutants, NO2, CO, and PM2.5. Asthma admissions rose 4.48% (95% confidence interval 0.71, 8.38%) per 28 microgm/m3 increase in L03 PM10 levels and 7.60% (95% confidence interval 2.87, 12.54%) per 10 ppb increase in L03 ozone. Cerebrovascular disease admissions were associated with PM10 and CO, both at lag 3 days. SO2 exhibited no relationship with admissions. CONCLUSIONS: Risk of hospital admissions in Taipei may be increased by air pollution and sandstorms. Additional research is needed to clarify the lag structure and magnitude of such effects."

Few studies have been conducted in less-developed countries in regions with a tropical climate. This study evaluated whether short-term exposures to fine particulate matter (PM10) and ozone (O-3) were associated with hospital visits for cardiovascular diseases (CVD; ICD-10th, 100-199) in central Bangkok, Thailand. Methods: Data from hospital records were obtained from 3 major government hospitals. All hospital visits were stratified by age group and category of CVD. Daily PM10 and O-3 levels reported by the Pollution Control Department from April 2002 to December 2006 (1736 days) were used in a time-series analysis with a generalized additive model procedure. Results: Exposure on the previous day to PM10 and O-3 had a positive association with hospital visits for CVD among elderly (>= 65 years) individuals. The increase in CVD hospital visits in this age group was 0.10% (95% Cl, 0.03-0.19) with a 10 mu g/m(3) increase in PM10, and 0.50% (95% CI, 0.19-0.81) with an increase in O-3. Conclusions: In central Bangkok, a short-term association was observed between increases in daily levels of PM10 and O-3 and the number of daily emergency hospital visits for CVD, particularly among individuals aged >= 65 years."

The authors' prior investigations on the association between air pollution exposure and stroke mortality led to the current study, which was conducted to assess the effects of ambient air pollution on ischemic cardiovascular diseases among the elderly population (i.e., males and females 64+ yr of age) in Seoul, Korea. The authors estimated the relative risks of hospitalization associated with an interquartile range (IQR) increase in pollution concentrations; a generalized additive Poisson model was used to conduct a time-series analysis of the counts. The concentrations of ambient air pollutants were lower than the current recommendations for air quality in Korea. The estimated relative risks of hospitalization associated with an IQR were 1.05 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.01, 1.10) for particulate matter less than or equal to 10 microm in diameter (PM10) (IQR = 40.4 microg/m3); 1.10 (95% CI = 1.05, 1.15) for ozone (IQR = 21.7 ppb); 1.08 (95% CI = 1.03, 1.14) for nitrogen dioxide (IQR = 14.6 ppb); 1.07 (95% CI = 1.01, 1.13) for carbon monoxide (IQR = 1.0 ppm); and 0.95 (95% CI = 0.90, 1.01) for sulfur dioxide (IQR = 4.4 ppb). The authors observed that sulfur dioxide was a significant risk factor for ischemic heart disease-related hospital admissions during the summer months (i.e., June, July, and August) (relative risk = 1.32; 95% CI = 1.08, 1.62). Hospital admissions for ischemic heart diseases were associated significantly with daily variations in levels of ambient air pollutants. These findings may provide new insights into the possible pathologic mechanisms involving air pollutants, and they support the hypothesis that the elderly appear to be at particular risk from the effects of air pollution, at pollutant levels lower than the standards commonly adopted by many countries."

The aim of this study was to determine ozone trajectories along the northern coast of Portugal during the summer months of 2005, when there was a spate of forest fires in the region, evaluating their impact on respiratory and cardiovascular health in the greater metropolitan area of Porto. We investigated the following diseases, as coded in the ninth revision of the International Classification of Diseases: hypertensive disease (codes 401-405); ischemic heart disease (codes 410-414); other cardiac diseases, including heart failure (codes 426-428); chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and allied conditions, including bronchitis and asthma (codes 490-496); and pneumoconiosis and other lung diseases due to external agents (codes 500-507). We evaluated ozone data from air quality monitoring stations in the study area, together with data collected through HYbrid Single-Particle Lagrangian Integrated Trajectory (HYSPLIT) model analysis of air mass circulation and synoptic-scale zonal wind from National Centers for Environmental Prediction data. High ozone levels in rural areas were attributed to the dispersion of pollutants induced by local circulation, as well as by mesoscale and synoptic scale processes. The fires of 2005 increased the levels of pollutants resulting from the direct emission of gases and particles into the atmosphere, especially when there were incoming frontal systems. For the meteorological case studies analyzed, peaks in ozone concentration were positively associated with higher rates of hospital admissions for cardiovascular diseases, although there were no significant associations between ozone peaks and admissions for respiratory diseases."

STUDY DESIGN: Ecological longitudinal time-series study. METHODS: The dependent variable used was the daily number of emergency hospital admissions registered at the Gregorio Maranon University Teaching Hospital. The following causes were analysed: all causes [International Classification of Diseases 9th Version (ICD-9:1-799)], respiratory causes (ICD-9: 460-519) and circulatory causes (ICD-9: 390-459). Analysis focused on subjects over 75 years of age. Daily records of mean concentrations of PM(2.5), PM(10), NO(2), NO(x), SO(2) and O(3) in Madrid were used as independent variables. The control variables were seasonalities, trend, influenza epidemics, noise and pollen concentrations. Poisson regression models were constructed to calculate the relative risk (RR) and attributable risk (AR). Analyses were performed for the entire year and for the winter and summer. RESULTS: PM(2.5) was the single primary pollutant that proved statistically significant in all models. The functional relationship with hospital admissions was linear and had no threshold. Taking the year as a whole, the RRs among people over 75 years of age for an increase of 10 microg/m(3) in PM(2.5) concentrations were: 1.038 [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.022-1.053] for all causes at lag 0; 1.062 (95% CI 1.036-1.089) for circulatory causes at lag 0; and 1.049 (95% CI 1.019-1.078) for respiratory causes at lag 3. The ARs were 3.6%, 5.9% and 4.6%, respectively. These risks increased in winter and no statistically significant associations were observed in summer. PM(2.5) was the only primary pollutant that showed a statistically significant association with hospital admissions among people over 75 years of age in Madrid across the study period. CONCLUSION: Measures should be implemented to reduce PM(2.5) concentrations in Madrid."

Such associations have not been investigated in smaller size cities in the Eastern Mediterranean. A particular feature in the region is dust blown from the Sahara a few times a year resulting in extreme PM10 concentrations. It is not entirely clear whether such natural phenomena pose the same risks. METHODS: The effect of changes in daily levels of particulate matter (PM10) and ozone (O3) on hospitalization for all, cardiovascular and respiratory causes in the two hospitals in Nicosia during 1 January 1995 and 30 December 2004 was investigated using generalized additive Poisson models after controlling for long- and short-term patterns as well as for the effect of weather. Meteorological records were reviewed to identify dust-storm days and analyses were repeated to quantify their effect on cardio-respiratory morbidity. RESULTS: For every 10 microg/m3 increase in daily average PM10 concentrations, there was a 0.9% (95%CI: 0.6%, 1.2%) increase in all-cause and 1.2% (95%CI: -0.0%, 2.4%) increase in cardiovascular admissions. With respect to respiratory causes, an effect was observed only in the warm months. No lagged effects with levels of PM10 were observed. In contrast, positive associations with levels of ozone were only observed the two days prior to admission. These appeared stronger for cardiovascular causes and independent of the effect of PM. All-cause and cardiovascular admissions were 4.8% (95%CI: 0.7%, 9.0%) and 10.4% (95%CI: -4.7%, 27.9%) higher on dust storm days respectively. In both cases the magnitude of effect was comparable to that seen on the quartile of non-storm days with the highest levels of PM10. CONCLUSION: We observed an increased risk of hospitalization at elevated levels of particulate matter and ozone generally consistent with the magnitude seen across several European cities. We also observed an increased risk of hospitalization on dust storm days, particularly for cardiovascular causes. While inference from these associations is limited due to the small number of dust storm days in the study period, it would appear imperative to issue health warnings for these natural events, particularly directed towards vulnerable population groups."

This paper aimed to determine whether environmental factors could have been responsible for this 'outbreak'. METHODS: The outcome studied was daily counts of emergency department visits for cardiovascular or chest pain syndromes that were considered immediately or imminently life threatening on arrival at hospital. The outbreak had a mean daily count of 5.7 visits sustained for eight weeks, compared with 4.0 in the same months in previous years. Poisson regression was used to systematically assess the emergency department visits in relation to available daily weather and pollution variables by first finding the best model that explained short-term variation in the outcome over the period 25 January 2002 to 31 May 2005, and then assessing interactions of all available variables with the 'outbreak' period, April-May 2005. Rate ratios were estimated for an interquartile increase in each variable meaning that the ratio measures the relative increase (or decrease) in the emergency department visits for an interquartile increase in the weather or pollution variable. The rate ratios for the outbreak period measure the relative increase (or decrease) in the emergency department visits for an interquartile increase in the weather or pollution variable during the outbreak period only. RESULTS: The best fitting model over the whole study period included minimum temperature with a rate ratio (RR) of 0.86 (95% confidence interval (CI), 0.77-0.96), maximum relative humidity of 1.09 (95% CI 1.05-1.14) and minimum daily particulate matter less than 10 microns (PM10) of 1.05 (95% CI, 1.01-1.09). During the outbreak period, maximum temperature (RR 1.27, 95% CI 1.03-1.57), solar radiation (RR 1.44, 95% CI, 1.00-2.07) and ozone (RR 1.13, 95% CI 1.01-1.26) were associated with the outcome. CONCLUSION: The increase may have been associated with photochemical pollution. Syndromic surveillance can identify outbreaks of non-communicable diseases associated with environmental factors."

Daily emergency admissions for all cardiovascular diseases (CVD) and heart diseases (HD) were obtained from hospital records, and the corresponding daily levels of particulates, SO2, NO2, CO, and ozone were recorded. The magnitude of association was estimated using Poisson generalised additive models controlling for confounding and overdispersion. For each cause, lagged effects, up to three days, of each pollutant were examined and combined estimates were obtained. For ozone the analyses were restricted to the warm period. One and two pollutant models were performed. RESULTS: Associations were more consistent in lag 0 (concurrent day) and 1 (lag 0-1), except in the case of ozone where there was a more delayed relation (lag 2-3). For combined estimates an increase of 10 microg/m3 in the PM10 levels in lag 0-1 was associated with an increase of 0.9% (95% CI: 0.4 to 1.5%) in the number of hospital admissions for CVD, and 1.6% (0.8 to 2.3%) for HD. For ozone the corresponding estimates for lag 2-3 were 0.7% (0.3 to 1.0) for CVD, and 0.7% (0.1 to 1.2) for HD. An increase of 1 mg/m3 in CO levels was associated with an increase of 2.1% (0.7 to 3.5%) in CVD admissions, and 4.2% (1.3 to 7.1%) in HD admissions. SO2 and NO2 estimates were more sensitive in two pollutant models CONCLUSIONS: A short term association between increases in daily levels of air pollutants and the number of daily admissions for cardiovascular diseases, with specificity for heart diseases, has been described in Spanish cities."

The objective of this study was to evaluate the short-term effects of urban air pollution on cardiac hospital readmissions in survivors of myocardial infarction, a potentially susceptible subpopulation. METHODS AND RESULTS: In this European multicenter cohort study, 22,006 survivors of a first myocardial infarction were recruited in Augsburg, Germany; Barcelona, Spain; Helsinki, Finland; Rome, Italy; and Stockholm, Sweden, from 1992 to 2000. Hospital readmissions were recorded in 1992 to 2001. Ambient nitrogen dioxide, carbon monoxide, ozone, and mass of particles <10 microm (PM10) were measured. Particle number concentrations were estimated as a proxy for ultrafine particles. Short-term effects of air pollution on hospital readmissions for myocardial infarction, angina pectoris, and cardiac causes (myocardial infarction, angina pectoris, dysrhythmia, or heart failure) were studied in city-specific Poisson regression analyses with subsequent pooling. During follow-up, 6655 cardiac readmissions were observed. Cardiac readmissions increased in association with same-day concentrations of PM10 (rate ratio [RR] 1.021, 95% CI 1.004 to 1.039) per 10 microg/m3) and estimated particle number concentrations (RR 1.026 [95% CI 1.005 to 1.048] per 10,000 particles/cm3). Effects of similar strength were observed for carbon monoxide (RR 1.014 [95% CI 1.001 to 1.026] per 200 microg/m3 [0.172 ppm]), nitrogen dioxide (RR 1.032 [95% CI 1.013 to 1.051] per 8 microg/m3 [4.16 ppb]), and ozone (RR 1.026 [95% CI 1.001 to 1.051] per 15 microg/m3 [7.5 ppb]). Pooled effect estimates for angina pectoris and myocardial infarction readmissions were comparable. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that ambient air pollution is associated with increased risk of hospital cardiac readmissions of myocardial infarction survivors in 5 European cities."

In this study we investigated the short-term effects of air pollution on hospital admissions for stroke in a setting where pollutant levels are rather low. We also addressed methodological issues in evaluating the short-term effects of air pollution. Methods: Daily admissions of ischemic (n = 11,267) and hemorrhagic (n = 1,681) stroke were obtained from a Swedish quality register for stroke, Riks-Stroke. We used two types of exposure data: (1) daily measured background levels of ozone, temperature and particles with a diameter <10 mum (PM(10)) and (2) modeled levels of a mixture of NO and NO(2) (NO(x)) at the residential address of each individual. Results: We estimated a 13% (95% confidence interval, 4-22%) increased risk for hospital admissions for ischemic stroke for levels of PM(10) above 30 mug/m(3) compared to <15 mug/m(3), whereas temperature above 16 degrees C decreased the risk. No consistent associations were found for hemorrhagic stroke or for ischemic stroke and ozone or NO(x). Conclusion: Particulate air pollution and temperature seemed to be associated with ischemic stroke hospital admissions. Individual exposure modeling facilitates a detailed exposure assessment but may also be more prone to misclassification errors. The time series and case crossover approaches yielded similar effect estimates."

However, analyses for more cause-specific morbidity or mortality outcomes have rarely been performed. Therefore, we determined the short-term associations of ozone with cause-specific cardiorespiratory mortality and morbidity by age groups. 
Methods: Daily levels of O3 were measured at a background measurement station in 1998-2004 in Helsinki, Finland. All analyses were a priori restricted to the warm season. Among the elderly (>/-65 years) and adults (15-64), we studied daily cause-specific cardiorespiratory mortality and hospital admissions. We also analyzed data on associations between O3 and asthma emergency room visits among children (<15 years). We adjusted all models for PM2.5, and used Poisson regression for the analyses. 
Results: We found a positive association between O3 and asthma-COPD admissions among the elderly (9.6%; 95% CI, 2.0 ? 17.8, at 0-day lag for 25?g/m3 increase in O3). We found also consistent associations between O3 and asthma emergency room visits among children (e.g. 12.6%; 0.8 - 25.1, 0-day lag). There was a suggestion of an association between O3 and arrhythmia admissions among the elderly (6.4%; 0.63 - 12.5, 1-day lag), which was slightly confounded by PM2.5. 
Conclusions: We found positive associations for ambient ozone with asthma visits among children and with pooled asthma-COPD admissions among the elderly. The evidence of positive association between ozone and cardiovascular health was weaker."

The present study aims at estimating the association between particles with diameter < 10 mum (PM SUB 10), nitrogen dioxide (NO SUB 2) and ozone and hospitalizations for cardiovascular diseases in eight French cities during the 1998-2003 period. 

METHODS: The daily number of hospitalizations in each city was extracted from the French hospital information system (PMSI) for cardiovascular diseases, cardiac diseases, ischemic heart diseases and stroke. Excess relative risks (ERRs) of hospitalization associated with a 10 mug/m SUP 3 increase in pollutant levels were estimated in each city by fitting a Poisson regression model, controlling for well-known confounding factors and temporal trends. City-specific results were then combined by inverse variance weighting. 

RESULTS: Daily number of hospitalizations for cardiovascular diseases was associated with PM SUB 10 levels (for a 10 mug/m SUP 3 increase, ERR = 0.8%, 95% CI: [0.2, 1.5]), with NO SUB 2 (1.1%, [0.6, 1.6]) but not with ozone (0.1% [- 0.2%, 0.5%]). Associations were stronger in people aged 65 years and over, and when only hospitalizations for ischemic heart diseases were considered. No association was found between strokes and air pollution levels. 

DISCUSSION: Our study suggests that the ambient levels of air pollutants currently experienced in the eight French cities, which are close to European air quality guidelines, are yet linked to a short term increase of hospitalizations for cardiovascular diseases. These results are consistent with epidemiological and toxicological data on the cardiovascular effects of air pollution."

DESIGN: Associations were assessed using the case-crossover method for seven cities: Auckland and Christchurch, New Zealand; and Brisbane, Canberra, Melbourne, Perth, and Sydney Australia. Results were combined across cities using a random-effects meta-analysis and stratified for two adult age groups: 15-64 years and >/= 65 years of age (elderly). Pollutants considered were nitrogen dioxide, carbon monoxide, daily measures of particulate matter (PM) and ozone. Where multiple pollutant associations were found, a matched case-control analysis was used to identify the most consistent association. RESULTS: In the elderly, all pollutants except O3 were significantly associated with five categories of cardiovascular disease admissions. No associations were found for arrhythmia and stroke. For a 0.9-ppm increase in CO, there were significant increases in elderly hospital admissions for total cardiovascular disease (2.2%) , all cardiac disease (2.8%), cardiac failure (6.0%), ischemic heart disease (2.3%), and myocardial infarction (2.9%). There was some heterogeneity between cities, possibly due to differences in humidity and the percentage of elderly people. In matched analyses, CO had the most consistent association. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that air pollution arising from common emission sources for CO, NO2, and PM (e.g., motor vehicle exhausts) has significant associations with adult cardiovascular hospital admissions, especially in the elderly, at air pollution concentrations below normal health guidelines. Relevance to clinical and professional practice: Elderly populations in Australia need to be protected from air pollution arising from outdoor sources to reduce cardiovascular disease."

Daily measurements of particles (measured by nephelometry and PM2.5), photochemical oxidants (measured as ozone), nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and carbon monoxide (CO) concentrations were obtained from 1992 to 1998 via a metropolitan network of monitoring stations. Daily PM2.5 concentrations were estimated using monitored data, modelling and interpolation. Hospital morbidity data for respiratory, cardiovascular (CVD), gastrointestinal (GI) diseases, chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases (COPD) excluding asthma; pneumonia/influenza diseases; and asthma were obtained and categorized into all ages, less than 15 years and greater than 65 years. Gastrointestinal morbidity was used as a control disease. The data were analyzed using conditional logistic regression. The results showed a small number of significant associations for daily changes in particle concentrations, nitrogen dioxide and carbon monoxide for the respiratory diseases, COPD, pneumonia, asthma and CVD hospitalizations. Changes in ozone concentrations were not significantly associated with any disease outcomes. These data provide useful information on the potential health impacts of air pollution in an airshed with very low sulphur dioxide concentrations and lower nitrogen dioxide concentrations commonly found in many other cities."

An association between traffic-related air pollution and AMI has been suggested, but the evidence is still limited. Objectives: to evaluate in a multi-centre study association between hospitalisation for first AMI and daily levels of traffic-related air pollution. Methods: We collected data on first AMI hospitalisations in 5 European cities. AMI registers were available in Augsburg and Barcelona; hospital discharge registers (HDRs) were used in Helsinki, Rome and Stockholm. NO2, CO and PM10 (particles <10 mu m) were measured at central monitoring sites. Particle number concentration (PNC), a proxy for ultrafine particles (<0.1 mu m), was measured for a year in each centre, and then modelled retrospectively for the whole study period. We used generalized additive models for statistical analyses. Age and 28-day fatality and season were considered as potential effect modifiers in the 3 HDR centres. Results: Nearly 27 000 cases of first AMI were recorded. There was a suggestion of an association of the same day CO and PNC levels with AMI: RR=1.005 (95% confidence interval: 1.000-1.010) per 0.2 mg/m3 and RR=1.005 (95%CI: 0.996-1.015) per 10000 particles/cm3, respectively. However, associations were only observed in the 3 cities with HDR, where power for city-specific analyses was higher. We observed in these cities the most consistent associations among fatal cases aged <75 years: RR at 1-day lag for CO=1.021 (95%CI: 1.000-1.048) per 0.2 mg/m3, for PNC= 1.058 (95% CI: 1.012-1.107) per 10000 particles/cm3, and for NO2=1.032 (95%CI: 0.998-1.066) per 8 mu g/m3. Effects of air pollution were more pronounced during the warm than the cold season. Conclusions: We found support for the hypothesis that exposure to traffic-related air pollution increases the risk of AMI. Most consistent associations were observed among fatal cases aged <75 years and in the warm season."

Although a fairly large number of studies have explored the cardiovascular impacts of air pollution, because of its unique location we studied the association between air pollutants and hospital admissions due to angina pectoris in Tehran for the first time.  METHODS:  This is a retrospective time-series study.  The variables of the study include the levels of five air pollutants-nitrogen dioxide (NO(2)), carbon monoxide (CO), ozone (O(3)), sulfur dioxide (SO(2)), and particulate matter <10 microm in aerodynamic diameter (PM(10))-as independent variables; daily hospitalizations due to angina pectoris in 25 academic hospitals in Tehran as the dependent variable; and mean daily temperature and humidity, seasonality, time trend, and day of the week as potential confounders.  All variables were measured during a 5-year period from 21 March 1996 to 20 March 2001.  The data of mean daily levels of NO(2), CO, O(3), SO(2), and PM(10) were collected from one of the stations of Tehran's Air Quality Control Corp. Data were analyzed using Poisson regression models.  Relative risks of angina pectoris admissions were calculated for an increase in 1mg/m(3) for CO and 10 microg/m(3) for the other pollutants.  RESULTS:  Daily admissions due to angina pectoris were significantly related to the CO level, after controlling for confounder effects.  Each unit increase in the CO level caused a 1.00934 increase in the number of admissions (95% CI, 1.00359--1.01512).  This association was verified with a lag of 1 day.  There was no significant association between the other air pollutants and the number of daily admission due to angina pectoris.  CONCLUSIONS:  We found that with increasing levels of the pollutant CO, the number of admissions due to cardiac angina rose.  Ischemic heart disease is the leading cause of death in Iran.  Air pollution control will reduce the number of this preventable disease and resulting deaths."

RESULTS: There was little difference between the results derived from the different statistical approaches for cardiovascular admissions, while in those for respiratory admissions there were differences. For three of the four cities (for the other the results were positive but not significant), fine particles (measured by nephelometry - bsp) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) have a significant impact on cardiovascular admissions (for total cardiac admissions, RR = 1.0856 for a one-unit increase in bsp (10(-4) x m(-1)), RR = 1.0023 for a 1 ppb increase in NO2). For three of the four cities (for the other, the results were negative and significant), fine particles, NO2 and ozone have a significant impact on respiratory admissions (for total elderly respiratory admissions, RR = 1.0552 per 1 unit (10(-4) x m(-1)) increase in bsp, RR = 1.0027 per 1ppb increase in NO2, RR = 10014 per 1 ppb increase in ozone for elderly asthma and COPD admissions). In all analyses the particle and NO2 impacts appear to be related. CONCLUSIONS: Similar to overseas studies, air pollution has an impact on hospital admissions in Australian cities, but there can be significant differences between cities."

However the evidence regarding the association between air pollution and acute cardiac events, such as out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, is inconsistent.

Methods: We investigated the association between particulate matter (PM) air pollution and out-of-hospital cardiac arrest using a case-crossover study of adults (age, 35+ years) in Melbourne, Australia. We included 8434 cases identified through the Victorian Cardiac Arrest Registry from 2003 through 2006. We excluded arrests with an obvious preceding noncardiac event such as trauma, poisoning, or drowning, leaving only those events that were presumed to have cardiac etiology. Air pollution concentrations obtained from a central monitoring site were used for day of the arrest and for lag 1, lag 2, and lag 3, including the average lag 0-1. 

Results: An interquartile range increase of 4.26 mu g/m(3) in PM(2.5) over 2 days (lag 0-1) was associated with an increase in risk for an out-of-hospital cardiac arrest of 3.6% (95% confidence interval = 1.3% to 6.0%). PM 10 and carbon monoxide also showed associations, but not as strong as for PM(2.5). Longer lag periods did not show such strong relationships. There was no association of these cardiac events with ozone, sulfur dioxide, or nitrogen dioxide in any lag period. Individuals age 65-74 years old were most susceptible to PM(2.5) exposure, while those 75 years and older had the lowest risk. 

Conclusion: These findings support an association between daily average PM(2.5) concentrations and an increased risk of out-of-hospital cardiac arrests."

The authors analyzed 8,216 out-of-hospital cardiac arrests of primary cardiac etiology during the years 2002-2006. Time-series and case-crossover analyses were conducted, controlling for season, day-of-week, same-day, and delayed/apparent temperature. An increased risk of cardiac arrest in time-series (relative risk (RR) = 1.06, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.02, 1.10) and case-crossover (RR = 1.04, 95% CI: 0.99, 1.08) analysis for a PM(2.5) increase of 10 mug/m(3) in the average of 0- and 1-day lags was found. The association was significant in the warm season (RR = 1.09, 95% CI: 1.03, 1.15) but not the cold season (RR = 1.01, 95% CI: 0.95, 1.07). Associations of cardiac arrest with other pollutants were weaker. These findings, consistent with studies implicating acute cardiovascular effects of PM, support a link between PM(2.5) and out-of-hospital cardiac arrests. Since few individuals survive an arrest, air pollution control may help prevent future cardiovascular mortality."

Methods: Outcome data on 4,407,535 emergency department visits were compiled from 31 hospitals in Atlanta. The air quality data included measurements of criteria pollutants for the entire study period, as well as detailed measurements of mass concentrations for the fine and coarse fractions of PM and several physical and chemical characteristics of PM for the final 25 months of the study. Emergency department visits for CVD and for cardiovascular sub-groups were assessed in relation to daily measures of air pollutants using Poisson generalized linear models controlling for long-term temporal trends and meteorologic conditions with cubic splines.

Results: Using an a priori 3-day moving average in single-pollutant models, CVD visits were associated with NO2, CO, PM2.5, organic carbon, elemental carbon, and oxygenated hydrocarbons. Secondary analyses suggested that these associations tended to be strongest with same-day pollution levels. 

Conclusions: These findings provide evidence for an association between CVD visits and several correlated pollutants, including gases, PM2.5  and PM2.5 components."

METHODS: The number of daily cardiac hospital admissions was obtained from all Windsor hospitals from April 1, 1995 to December 31, 2000 and linked to concentrations of ambient air pollutants and weather variables. The logarithm of daily counts of hospitalization was regressed on the levels of pollutants, after adjusting for seasonal, weekly cycles, and weather variables using time series analysis with natural splines as smoothing functions. RESULTS: Of all the pollutants considered, sulphur dioxide (SO2) had the strongest effect on cardiac hospitalization among the > or = 65 age group. The percentage increase in daily admission was 2.6% for current day sulphur dioxide level (95% CI: 0.5-6.4), 4.0% for 2-day mean level (95% CI: 0.1-6.9), and 5.6% (95% CI: 1.5-9.9) for 3-day mean level for an increase in interquartile range of 19.3 ppb. When particulate PM10 was included in the model, the contributing effect of sulphur dioxide remained significant for the > or = 65 age group for all three levels. CONCLUSIONS: Short-term effects of sulphur dioxide are associated significantly to daily cardiac hospital admissions for people > or = 65 years of age living in Windsor.

Daily concentrations of nitrogen dioxide (NO2), sulphur dioxide (SO2), ozone (O3), and particulate matter <10 ""mu""m in aerodynamic diameter (PM10) were obtained from seven air monitoring stations in Hong Kong in 1994 and 1995. Relative risks (RR) of respiratory and cardiovascular disease admissions (for an increase of 10 ""mu""g/m3 in concentration of air pollutant) were calculated. Results- Significant associations were found between hospital admissions for all respiratory diseases, all cardiovascular diseases, chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases, and heart failure and the concentrations of all four pollutants. Admissions for asthma, pneumonia, and influenza were significantly associated with NO2, O3, and PM10. Relative risk (RR) for admissions for respiratory disease for the four pollutants ranged from 1.013 (for SO2) to 1.022 (for O3), and for admissions for cardiovascular disease, from 1.006 (for PM10) to 1.016 (for SO2). Those aged >=65 years were at higher risk. Significant positive interactions were detected between NO2, O3, and PM10, and between O3 and winter months.

METHODS: A time series study was conducted in the City of Edinburgh, which has a population of about 450,000. Poisson log linear regression models were used to investigate the relation of the daily event rate with daily air pollution concentrations of sulphur dioxide (SO2) and black smoke from 1981 to 1995, and of nitrogen dioxide (NO2), ozone (O3), carbon monoxide (CO), and particulate matter (PM10) from 1992 to 1995. Adjustments were made for seasonal and weekday variation, daily temperature, and wind speed.

RESULTS: The most significant findings were positive associations over the period 1981-95 between black smoke as a mean of the previous three days and daily all cause mortality in people aged > or = 65, and respiratory mortality also in this age group (3.9% increase in mortality for a 10 micrograms/m3 increment in black smoke). For hospital emergency admissions between 1992 and 1995 the two most significant findings (p < 0.05) were for cardiovascular admissions of people aged > or = 65 which showed a positive association with PM10 as a mean of the 3 previous days, and a negative association with O3 as a mean of the previous three days. Analyses of outcomes based on linkage with previous cardiorespiratory emergency admissions did not show substantially different results.

CONCLUSION: These data suggest that in the City of Edinburgh, after correction for confounders, there was a small but significant association between concentrations of black smoke and respiratory mortality in the older age group, probably attributable to higher pollution levels in the early part of the study period. There were also generally weak and variable associations between day to day changes in concentrations of urban air pollutants at a single central point and emergency hospital admission rates from cardiac and respiratory disease."

We performed Poisson regressions for the entire patient population and for subgroups defined by season, region, or personal characteristics, allowing for effects of temporal variation, weather, and autocorrelation. CO showed the most consistently significant (p < 0.05) relationships to cardiovascular admissions. A wintertime 25th-75th percentile increase in CO (1.1-2.2 ppm) predicted an increase of 4% in cardiovascular admissions. NO2, and, to a lesser extent, PM10 tracked CO and showed similar associations with cardiovascular disease, but O3 was negatively or nonsignificantly associated. No significant demographic differences were found, although increased cardiovascular effects were suggested in diabetics, in whites and blacks (relative to Hispanics and Asians), and in persons older than 65 years of age. Pulmonary disease admissions associated more with NO2 and PM10 than with CO. Pulmonary effects were generally smaller than cardiovascular effects and were more sensitive to the choice of model. We conclude that in Los Angeles, atmospheric stagnation with high primary (CO/NO2/PM10) pollution, most common in autumn/winter, increases the risk of hospitalization for cardiopulmonary illness.

An increase from the 10th to the 90th percentile in daily maximum 1-hour nitrogen dioxide, daily maximum 1-hour ozone, and daily mean particulate was associated with an increase in heart disease admissions among those 65 years and older of 6.71% (4.25, 9.23), 2.45% (-0.37, 5.35), and 2.82% (0.90, 4.77), respectively. Heart disease and childhood asthma were primarily associated with nitrogen dioxide; COPD was associated with both nitrogen dioxide and particulates.

The authors used the Air Pollution on Health: European Approach protocol to examine the effects of particles, ozone, sulfur dioxide, and nitrogen dioxide on daily hospital admissions for asthma and respiratory, cardiovascular, and digestive disorders (control diagnosis) that occurred during the period 1987-1994. Ozone was consistently associated with admissions for asthma and respiratory disease-with little evidence of a threshold. In two-pollutant models, the ozone effect was relatively unaffected by the control for high levels of other pollutants. Particulate pollution (measured by nephelometry) was associated positively with admissions for respiratory disease and admissions for asthma in summer, whereas a negative association was observed for cardiovascular admissions. Although sulfur dioxide was associated significantly with admissions for respiratory and cardiovascular disese, a significant association was also found for the control diagnosis of digestive disorders. No significant associations were found for nitrogen dioxide over the study period, although significantly positive seasonal interactions were found for asthma and respiratory disease in autumn, winter, and spring. It was concluded that current levels of ambient air pollution in Brisbane make a significant contribution to the variation in daily hospital admissions for asthma and respiratory disease."

METHODS: Long term concurrent trends, temperature, humidity, day of the week, influenza epidemic of 1989, and cyclical covariations with periodicity > 20 days in daily measures of pollution and admissions for 1987-94 were allowed for. 

RESULTS: There were 373556 admissions. No association was found between O3 and circulatory diseases. Four other pollutants were associated with acute myocardial infarction and circulatory diseases combined. P values and attributable cases (95% confidence intervals) for acute myocardial infarction were: black smoke P = 0.003, 2.5% (0.8% to 4.3%); NO2 P = 0.002, 2.7% (0.8% to 4.6%); CO P = 0.001, 2.1% (0.7% to 3.5%); and SO2 P = 0.0006, 1.7% (0.7% to 2.6%). There were also associations between black smoke and angina (P = 0.02), NO2 and arrhythmia (P = 0.04), and CO and other circulatory diseases (P = 0.004), but none with heart failure. Acute myocardial infarction was the only diagnosis for which there were significant associations with and without adjustment for cyclical terms. The associations with acute myocardial infarction were significant only in the cool season. 

CONCLUSION: Population data were consistent with 1 in 50 heart attacks currently presenting at London hospitals being triggered by outdoor air pollution. Further research is now needed to investigate whether background concentrations of black smoke, NO2, CO, and SO2 are a preventable cause of myocardial infarction. These results, if applied to all myocardial infarctions in the United Kingdom, indicate a potential saving of 6000 heart attacks a year."

The relative risk of hospital admission for CVD was estimated using a case-crossover approach, controlling for weather variables, day of the week, seasonality, and long-term time trends. In the single-pollutant model, on warm days (> or =25 degrees C) statistically significant positive associations were found between levels of particular matter of < 10 microm aerodynamic diameter (PM10), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), carbon monoxide (CO), and ozone (O3).

The lowered EEG amplitude and the suppressed PS recovered more rapidly during the post-exposure period than did the lowered HR. The ip administration of atropine sulfate blocked the suppressed W, the increased SWS and the lowered HR, while the lowered EEG amplitude and the suppressed PS were not blocked. These observations suggest that the O3-induced bradycardia results from enhanced activity of cardiac parasympathetic nerves and that the O3-induced changes in W and SWS result secondarily from some circulatory factor including the bradycardia."

The rats, chronically implanted with an electrocardiographic  (ECG)  electrodes,  were  placed in a head-out plethysmograph for continuous ventilatory measurements of tidal volume and breathing frequency. Simultaneous measurements of HR were also obtained. A 6-hr exposure of each rat to filtered air was followed 2 days later by a 5-hr exposure to 0.1 ppm O3, 5 days later by a 5-hr exposure to 0.3 ppm O3 and 10 days later by a 5-hr exposure to 0.5 ppm O3. Each of the O3 exposures was preceded by a 1-hr exposure to filtered air. Transient rapid shallow breathing with slightly increased HR appeared 1-2 min after the start  of  O3  exposure.  It  was  suggested on the basis of the electroencephalographic (EEG) activity of the olfactory bulb that this transient response was mediated through olfactory sensation. Persistent rapid shallow breathing with a progressive decrease in HR occurred with a latent period of 1-2 hr. The last 90-min averaged values for relative minute ventilation tended to decrease with the increase in the level of exposure to O3 and these values for young rats were significantly lower than those for old rats. An exposure of young rats to 0.1 ppm O3 for shorter than 5 hr significantly decreased the tidal volume and HR and increased breathing frequency, but no significant changes were observed in old rats. There were no differences between young and old rats in non-observable-adverse-effect-levels (NOAELs) for the O3-induced persistent ventilatory and HR responses, when the NOAELs were determined by exposure to 0.3 and 0.5 ppm O3. The present results, as well as the reported decrease in body temperature and blood pressure, suggested that the age-related changes in patterns and magnitude of the persistent rapid shallow breathing with a progressive decrease in HR are mediated through some age-related defense mechanism acting against O3 inhalation. The validity of the occupational exposure limit for O3 in workplaces was discussed in the light of the present findings."

No changes in rebreathing parameters or arterial blood gas measurements occurred in the air exposure control group. Therefore, an acute exposure to O3 resulted in adverse cardiopulmonary effects in dogs. Five additional dogs were exposed to 1.0 ppm O3 for 4 h while breathing spontaneously rather than with ventilation being assisted by electrophrenic stimulation (as done in the other exposures), and no changes in VTPC occurred.

Few studies have investigated the role of copollutants, such as ozone, in this association. Furthermore, the mechanisms by which PM affects cardiac function remain uncertain. We hypothesized that PM and O(3) induce adverse cardiovascular effects in mice and that these effects are strain dependent. STUDY DESIGN: After implanting radiotelemeters to measure heart rate (HR) and HR variability (HRV) parameters, we exposed C57Bl/6J (B6), C3H/HeJ (HeJ), and C3H/HeOuJ (OuJ) inbred mouse strains to three different daily exposures of filtered air (FA), carbon black particles (CB), or O(3) and CB sequentially [O(3)CB; for CB, 536 +/- 24 microg/m(3); for O(3), 584 +/- 35 ppb (mean +/- SE)]. RESULTS: We observed significant changes in HR and HRV in all strains due to O(3)CB exposure, but not due to sequential FA and CB exposure (FACB). The data suggest that primarily acute HR and HRV effects occur during O(3)CB exposure, especially in HeJ and OuJ mice. For example, HeJ and OuJ mice demonstrated dramatic increases in HRV parameters associated with marked brady-cardia during O(3)CB exposure. In contrast, depressed HR responses occurred in B6 mice without detectable changes in HRV parameters. CONCLUSIONS: These findings demonstrate that important interstrain differences exist with respect to PM- and O(3)-induced cardiac effects. This interstrain variation suggests that genetic factors may modulate HR regulation in response to and recuperation from acute copollutant exposures."

The role of particulate matter (PM) and ozone (O3) as co-pollutants in this association is unclear. We hypothesize that cardiac function following PM and O3 exposure is variably affected by genetic determinants (Nppa and Npr1 genes) and age. Heart function was measured before and after 2 days each of the following exposure sequence; (1) 2-h filtered air (FA) and 3-h carbon black (CB; 0.5 ?g/m3); (2) 2-h O3 (0.6ppm) and 3-h FA; (3) 5-h FA; and, (4) 2-h O3 and 3-h CB. Two age groups (5 and 18 months old (mo)) were tested in C57Bl/6J (B6) and 129S1/SvImJ (129) mice using echocardiographic (echo) and in vivo hemodynamic (IVH) measurements. With echo, posterior wall thickness was significantly (P<0.01) greater in 129 relative to B6 mice at baseline. With CB exposure, young B6 and older 129 mice show significant (P<0.01) reductions in fractional shortening (FS) compared to FA. With O3 exposure, FS was significantly (P<0.01) diminished in young 129, which was attributable to significant increases in end-systolic left ventricular diameter. With O3 and CB combined, notable (P<0.01) declines in heart rate and end-systolic posterior wall thickness occurred in young 129 mice. The IVH measurements showed striking (P<0.05) compromises in cardiac function after CB and O3 exposure; however, strain differences were undetectable. These results suggest that PM and O3 exposures, alone and combined, lead to different cardiac functional changes, and these unique changes are age-specific and dependent on Nppa and Npr1 genes."

Fibrin obtained from oxidized fibrinogen exhibits higher average fiber mass/length ratio compared with native fibrin. Fibrinogen ozonation sharply reduced the latent period preceding aggregation of protein molecules; however, the mechanism of self-assembly of ozonated and non-ozonated fibrinogen cluster was identical. In both cases flexible polymers are formed and reaching a certain critical length they form densely packed structures and aggregate. Using infrared spectroscopy, it has been shown that free radical oxidation of amino acid residues of fibrinogen polypeptide chains catalyzed by ozone results in formation of carbonyl, hydroxyl, and ether groups. It is concluded that fibrinogen peripheral D-domains are the most sensitive to ozonation, which causes local conformational changes in them.

Furthermore, intestine and lung epithelium synthesize FBG after exposure to inflammatory mediators, and both plasma and lung cell-derived FBG, along with fibronectin, assemble in detergent-insoluble extracellular matrices (ECM) of pneumocytes and fibroblasts independent of thrombin or plasmin cleavage. An epitope cryptic in soluble FBG (beta(15-21)) but exposed in matrix-FBG and fibrin induces cell proliferation and actin cytoskeleton reorganization during wound repair and angiogenesis. Although fibrin(ogen) is involved in hemostasis and homeostasis, mechanisms regulating extrahepatic FBG expression remain unexplored. Herein we examined FBG production by lung compared to liver epithelial cell lines in response to dexamethasone (DEX)+IL-6. Regulated synthesis of HepG2-FBG follows the pathway shown for constitutive synthesis by liver epithelium. Constitutive A549-FBG expression was not detectable, however, intracellular FBG precursors in DEX+IL-6-treated A549 lung cells were similar to HepG2 cells with two notable exceptions. The relative rate of chain synthesis in HepG2 cells was unequal, whereas nascent synthesis of all three chains occurred at equivalent rates in stimulated A549 cells. Unlike HepG2 cells, which rapidly secreted intact FBG, nascent dimeric FBG accumulated in the A549 cell-associated fraction prior to release into medium. Furthermore, soluble A549-FBG was susceptible to thrombin and plasmin cleavage. Interestingly, many functionally diverse proteins possess FBG-related domains that direct cell-fate determination during development or wound repair, suggesting that extrahepatic FBG biosynthesis evoked only during inflammation plays such a role during localized injury and repair to restore tissue homeostasis."

Recently, CSeco has been implicated in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis and Alzheimer's disease. In this communication, we report that CSeco induces cytotoxicity in H9c2 cardiomyoblasts with an IC(50) of 8.9+/-1.29 microM (n=6). The observed effect of CSeco at low micromolar concentrations retained several key features of apoptosis, such as changes in nuclear morphology, phosphatidylserine externalization, DNA fragmentation, and caspase 3/7 activity. Treatment of cardiomyocytes with 5 microM CSeco for 24h, for instance, resulted in 30.8+/-3.28% apoptotic and 1.8+/-1.11% of necrotic cells as against DMSO controls that only showed 1.3+/-0.33% of apoptosis and 1.6+/-0.67% of necrosis. In general, the loss of cellular viability paralleled the increased occurrence of apoptotic cells in various CSeco treatments.

Co-incubation of macrophage cells (J774.1) with atheronal-A (25 microM) and atheronal-B (25 microM) when complexed with low-density lipoprotein (LDL) (100 microg/mL) leads to a significant upregulation of scavenger receptor class A (approximately 3-fold increase relative to LDL alone, p < 0.05) but not CD36, showing that cultured macrophages respond to LDL-complexed atheronals in a manner highly analogous to acetylated LDL rather than oxidized LDL. Both atheronal-A and atheronal-B in solution exhibit a dose-dependent (0-25 microM) induction of chemotaxis of cultured macrophages (p < 0.001). When complexed with LDL (100 microg/mL), atheronal-A (but not atheronal-B) induces a dose-dependent (0-25 microM, p < 0.05) upregulation of the cell-surface adhesion molecule endothelial (E)-selectin on vascular endothelial cells (HUVECs). LDL (100 microg/mL) complexed atheronal-B (25 microM) but not atheronal-A induces cultured human monocytes (THP-1) to differentiate into macrophage cell lineage. When these in vitro data are taken together with the already known effects of cholesterol 5,6-secosterols on foam cell formation and macrophage cytotoxicity, the atheronals possess biological effects that if translated to an in vivo setting could lead to the recruitment, entrapment, dysfunction, and ultimate destruction of macrophages, with the major leukocyte player in inflammatory artery disease.

Long-Evans rats and Swiss mice, individually housed in running wheels, were exposed either to ozone (0.08, 0.12, 0.25, or 0.5 ppm) or to ammonia (100 or 300 ppm) for 6 hr.

Besides, ozone exposure was accompanied by increased plasma levels of corticosterone and free triiodothyronine (FT3). Expression of myosin heavy chain (MHC) was significantly affected in three of the five muscles studied. MHC 2B decreased significantly to the benefit of MHC 2A in diaphragm compared to control. MHC 2X increased in Anterior Digastric and decreased in Masseter Superficialis under ozone, to the benefit of MHC 2B in Masseter Superficialis.

Objectives: To examine the neurobehavioral effects associated with long-term exposure to ambient PM and ozone in adults.
Methods:We conducted a secondary analysis of the Neurobehavioral Evaluation System-2 (NES2) data (including a simple reaction time test [SRTT] measuring motor response speed to a visual stimulus; a symbol-digit substitution test [SDST] for coding ability; and a serial-digit learning test [SDLT] for attention and short-term memory) from 1764 adult participants (aged 37.5 ? 10.9 years) of the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey in 1988?1991. Based on ambient PM10 (PM with aerodynamic diameter <10 ?m) and ozone data from the EPA Aerometric Information Retrieval System database, estimated annual exposure prior to the examination were aggregated at the centroid of each census-block group of geocoded residences, using distance-weighted averages from all monitors in the residing and adjoining counties. Generalized linear models were constructed to examine the associations, adjusting for potential confounders.
Results:In age- and sex-adjusted models, PM10 predicted reduced CNS functions, but the association disappeared after adjustment for sociodemographic factors. There were consistent associations between ozone and reduced performance in NES2. In models adjusting for demographics, socioeconomic status, lifestyle, household and neighborhood characteristics, and cardiovascular risk factors, ozone predicted high scores in SDST and SDLT, but not in SRTT. Each 10-ppb increase in annual ozone was associated with increased SDST and SDLT scores by 0.16 (95%CI: 0.01, 0.23) and 0.56 (95%CI: 0.07, 1.05), equivalent to 3.5 and 5.3 years of aging-related decline in cognitive performance.

Animals were exposed to an ozone-free air stream and for 15, 30, 60, and 90 days to low doses of ozone to cause oxidative stress.

This is due in part to technical limitations of traditional approaches, in which only a small fraction of neurobiologically relevant proteins, mRNAs or metabolites can be assessed at a time. With the development and refinement of proteomic technologies that enable simultaneous quantitative assessment of hundreds to thousands of proteins, neuroproteomic studies of brain aging and cognitive decline are becoming more widespread. This review focuses on the contributions of neuroproteomic investigations to advances in our understanding of age-related deficits of hippocampus-dependent spatial learning and memory. Accumulating neuroproteomic data demonstrate that hippocampal aging involves common themes of dysregulated metabolism, increased oxidative stress, altered protein processing, and decreased synaptic function. Additionally, growing evidence suggests that cognitive decline does not represent a ""more aged"" phenotype, but rather is associated with specific neuroproteomic changes that occur in addition to age-related alterations. Understanding if and how age-related changes in the hippocampal neuroproteome contribute to cognitive decline and elucidating the pathways and processes that lead to cognitive decline are critical objectives that remain to be achieved.

The ozone exposures also elevated hippocampal superoxide accumulation and lipid peroxidation.

This was counteracted after 60 days of 17beta-estradiol treatment, when blood levels were highest. These results indicate that ozone exposure may be a useful Parkinson's disease model and neuroprotection afforded by 17beta-estradiol is dependent on the high levels achieved after its prolonged administration."

Another group exposed to 9h of O(3) plus 3h of clean-air exposure was also included. The results showed an important increase in TBARS content in all the studied structures.

Effects of inhaled pollutants on the production of vasoactive factors such as endothelin (ET) and nitric oxide (NO) in the brain may be relevant to disease pathogenesis. Inhaled pollutants increase circulating levels of ET-1 and ET-3, and the pituitary is a potential source of plasma ET, but the effects of pollutants on the expression of ET and NO synthase genes in the brain and pituitary are not known. In the present study, Fischer-344 rats were exposed by nose-only inhalation to particles (0, 5, 50mg/m3 EHC-93), ozone (0, 0.4, 0.8 ppm), or combinations of particles and ozone for 4 h. Real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction was used to measure mRNA levels in the cerebral hemisphere and pituitary 0 and 24 h post-exposure. Ozone inhalation significantly increased preproET-1 but decreased preproET-3 mRNAs in the cerebral hemisphere, while increasing mRNA levels of preproET-1, preproET-3, and the ET-converting enzyme (ECE)-1 in the pituitary. Inducible NO synthase (iNOS) was initially decreased in the cerebral hemisphere after ozone inhalation, but increased 24 h post-exposure. Particles decreased tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha mRNA in the cerebral hemisphere, and both particles and ozone decreased TNF-alpha mRNA in the pituitary. Our results show that ozone and particulate matter rapidly modulate the expression of genes involved in key vasoregulatory pathways in the brain and pituitary, substantiating the notion that inhaled pollutants induce cerebrovascular effects."

On the other hand, neuronal activity recorded in the cholinoceptive hypothalamic medial preoptic area (MPO) has been involved in the regulation of sleep. However, there is no direct evidence on the role that acetylcholine (Ach) release in the MPO plays in the sleep-wake cycle. In order to study this relation, we measured the Ach concentration in dialysates collected from MPO in rats exposed to coal-filtered air (clean air) for 48 h and in rats exposed to clean air for 24 h followed by 24-h of O3 exposure to 0.5 ppm. Polygraphic sleep records were taken simultaneously to neurochemical sampling. O3 was employed to disrupt the sleep-wake cycle and relate these changes with concomitant disruptions in Ach concentration dialyzed from MPO. A clear circadian pattern of Ach concentration was observed in dialysates from MPO and also in PS, SWS and wakefulness of rats exposed to filtered air. However, O3 exposure decreased the PS by 65% (Mann-Whitney's U-test, p<or=0.0003) and a concomitant decrease of extracellular Ach of 58% (p<or=0.0239) was observed during the light phase. These changes were maintained during the dark phase, although it was also observed that slow-wave sleep increased by 75% (p<or=0.0013) while wakefulness was decreased in 35% (p<or=0.0007). We conclude that Ach release in MPO follows a circadian rhythm that is disrupted by O3 exposure, and these changes are strongly associated with the O3-induced PS disruptions."

Since cerebellar morphologic disruptions have been reported with prenatal O3 exposure, O3 may have an effect on some neurotransmitter systems, such as monoamines. In order to test this hypothesis, we used 60 male rats taken from either, mothers exposed to 1 ppm of O3 during the entire pregnancy, or from mothers breathing filtered and clean air during pregnancy. The cerebellum was extracted at 0, 5, and 10 postnatal days. Tissues were processed in order to analyze by HPLC, dopamine (DA) levels, 3,4 dihydroxyphenilacetic acid (DOPAC) and homovanillic acid (HVA), norepinephrine (NA), serotonin, and 5-hydroxy-indole-acetic acid (5-HIAA) contents. Results showed a decrease of DA, NA, DOPAC and HVA mainly in 0 and 5 postnatal days. There were no changes in 5-HT levels, and 5-HIAA showed an increase after 10 postnatal days. DOPAC + HVA/DA ratio showed changes in 0 and 10 postnatal days, while 5-HIAA/5-HT ratio showed a slight decrease in 0 days. The data suggest that prenatal O3 exposure disrupts the cerebellar catecholamine system rather than the indole-amine system. Disruptions in cerebellar NA could lead to ataxic symptoms and also could limit recovery after cortical brain damage in adults. These finding are important given that recovery mechanisms observed in animals are also observed in humans."

However, very few studies have documented the effects on postnatal development of O3 during pregnancy. The long-term effects of prenatal O3 exposure in rats (0.5 ppm 12 h/day from embryonic day E5 to E20) were evaluated in the adult nucleus tractus solitarius (NTS) regulating respiratory control. Neuronal response was assessed by Fos protein immunolabeling (Fos-IR), and catecholaminergic neuron involvement by tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) labeling (TH-IR). Adult offspring were analyzed at baseline and following immobilization stress (one hour, plus two hours' recovery); immunolabeling was observed by confocal microscopy. Prenatal O3 increased the baseline TH gray level per cell (p < 0.001). In contrast, the number of Fos-IR cells, Fos-IR/TH-IR colabeled cells and proportion of TH double-labeled with Fos remained unchanged. After stress, the TH gray level (p < 0.001), number of Fos-IR cells (p < 0.001) and of colabeled Fos-IR/TH-IR cells (p < 0.05) and percentage of colabeled Fos-IR/TH-IR neurons against TH-IR cells (p < 0.05) increased in the control group. In prenatal-O3 rats, immobilization stress abolished these increases and reduced the TH gray level (p < 0.05), indicating that prenatal O3 led to loss of adult NTS reactivity to stress. We conclude that long-lasting sequelae were detected in the offspring beyond the prenatal O3 exposure. Prenatal O3 left a print on the NTS, revealed by stress. Disruption of neuronal plasticity to new challenge might be suggested."

For this purpose, the activity of tyrosine hydroxylase, the rate-limiting enzyme in catecholamine biosynthesis, was assessed in superior cervical ganglia and in two major noradrenergic cell groups, A2 and A6 (locus coeruleus). Tyrosine hydroxylase activity was estimated in vivo by measuring the accumulation of L-dihydroxyphenylalanine after pharmacological blockade of L-aromatic acid decarboxylases by NSD-1015 (100 mg/kg i.p.). The catecholamine turnover rate was measured after inhibition of tyrosine hydroxylase by alpha-methyl-para-tyrosine (AMPT, 250 mg/kg, i.p., 2.5 h) in peripheral sympathetic target organ (heart and lungs) as well as in some brain catecholamine terminal areas (cerebral cortex, hypothalamus and striatum). Ozone caused differential effects according to the structure. Catecholamine biosynthesis was stimulated in superior cervical ganglia (+44%, P < 0.05) and caudal A2 subset (+126%, P < 0.01), whereas catecholamine turnover was increased in heart (+183%, P < 0.01) and cortex (+22%, P < 0.05).

Circulating prolactin (PRL) levels were significantly elevated after exposure. Pituitary TSH and PRL content was considerably increased in ozone-exposed rats; however, only TSH was released significantly above control values in vitro. Thyroid weight was also significantly increased after exposure. The results suggest that the depression of the pituitary-thyroid axis may be an adaptive mechanism during ozone exposure by reducing hypothalamic stimulation via thyrotropin releasing hormone (TRH) and at the same time lifting the hypothalamic catecholamine inhibition on PRL release. Both may be necessary alterations in order to develop tolerance during ozone exposure."

Since O3 is a common air pollutant, an O3-induced alteration of mechanisms of drug action could have public health implications. It was shown that a 5-hr exposure to 1960 ?g O3/m3 (1 ppm) caused an increased PEN-induced S.T. in female mice (three strains), rats, and hamsters. This response was not observed in male rats or in male mice even when the latter were exposed for 5 hr/day for 3 days. Male hamsters were affected, but less so than females. Ozone concentration and time relationships were investigated in female mice. Concentrations from 196 to 9800 ?g O3/m3 (0.1 to 5 ppm) increased PEN-induced S.T. However, as the concentration was decreased, an increasing number of daily 3-hr exposures were needed to cause an effect. Once the maximal effect was observed, further daily exposures resulted in a dissipation or a disappearance of the effect. Also, recovery occurred within 24 hr after exposure ceased. Other experiments were performed in which mice received a continuous exposure to a C ? T (concentration ? time) of 5, ranging from 196 ?g/m3 (0.1 ppm) ? 50 hr to 1960 ?g/m3 (1 ppm) ? 5 hr. For most of the concentrations, the magnitudes of the O3 effects were roughly equivalent.

In the present studies we analyzed the effects of brief exposure of rats to inhaled ozone on production of this mediator by lung macrophages and type II epithelial cells. We found that ozone exposure (1-2 ppm, 3 hr) induced a marked increase in spontaneous nitric oxide production by alveolar (AM) and interstitial macrophages, as well as type II cells. These effects were apparently due to increased expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase protein and mRNA, which was evident in vitro in isolated cells and in situ in histologic sections. Macrophages and epithelial cells from ozone-treated rats were also sensitized to produce increased amounts of nitric oxide in response to inflammatory cytokines such as interferon-gamma, a response that was also mediated by inducible nitric oxide synthase. Unexpectedly, we also discovered that brief inhalation of ozone caused dramatic effects on the liver, including increased production of nitric oxide by hepatocytes and enhanced protein synthesis. These data suggest that this inhaled irritant induces an acute phase response. Additional studies indicate that AM from ozone-treated rats produced significantly more tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interleukin-1 than did cells from control animals. Elevated levels of tumor necrosis factor-alpha were also noted immunohistochemically in both lung and liver tissue. These results indicate that the extrapulmonary effects of ozone may be mediated by inflammatory cytokines released by activated lung macrophages.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

The mechanisms underlying this systemic response to ozone have not been previously elucidated. We have applied the technique of global gene expression analysis to the livers of C57BL mice acutely exposed to ozone. Mice lost up to 14% of their original body weight, with a 42% decrease in total food consumption. We previously had found significant up-regulation of genes encoding proliferative enzymes, proteins related to acute phase reactions and cytoskeletal functions, and other biomarkers of a cachexia-like inflammatory state in lungs of mice exposed to ozone. These results are consistent with a general up-regulation of different gene families responsive to NF-kappaB in the lungs of the exposed mice. In the present study, we observed significant down-regulation of different families of mRNAs in the livers of the exposed mice, including genes related to lipid and fatty acid metabolism, and to carbohydrate metabolism in this tissue, consistent with a systemic cachexic response. Several interferon-dependent genes were down-regulated in the liver, suggesting a possible role for interferon as a signaling molecule between lung and liver. In addition, transcription of several mRNAs encoding enzymes of xenobiotic metabolism in the livers of mice exposed to ozone was decreased, suggesting cytokine-mediated suppression of cytochrome P450 expression. This finding may explain a previously controversial report from other investigators more than 20 years ago of prolongation of pentobarbital sleeping time in mice exposed to ozone."

The research in our laboratories has focused on analyzing the role of macrophages in chemically induced injury in the lung and the liver. In both these tissues, a localized accumulation of macrophages is observed following toxicant exposure. This is directly correlated with the generation of cytotoxic inflammatory mediators at these sites. Moreover, when macrophage functioning is blocked, pulmonary and hepatic injury induced by toxicants such as ozone or acetaminophen is prevented. These findings provide direct support for our hypothesis that macrophages contribute to tissue injury. Approaches using pharmacologic inhibitors and transgenic animals are currently being used to evaluate the specific macrophage-derived products involved in the pathogenic process.

This is associated with an increase in the number of macrophages in the lung. We found that these cells are activated to release the proinflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor-""alpha"" (TNF""alpha"") which has been implicated in tissue injury. Following ozone inhalation, alveolar macrophages also produce increased amounts of the cytotoxic mediator, nitric oxide. This response is time-dependent and correlated with expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase (NOS II) protein and mRNA. Inhibition of macrophages with gadolinium chloride abrogates ozone-induced inflammation, mediator production and tissue injury. These data demonstrate, that macrophages and mediators they release contribute to irritant-induced lung injury. Ozone inhalation also caused alterations in the liver, including increased nitric oxide production and protein synthesis suggesting that ozone induces an acute phase response. We speculate that this is mediated by cytokines such as TNF""alpha"" produced by alveolar macrophages. In this regard we noted increased expression of TNF""alpha""  in both lung and liver tissue. Thus cytokines produced locally by macrophages following toxicant exposure may exert pathophysiologic effects outside the target organ."

The presence of spin adducts was determined by electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR)spectroscopy of chloroform extracts of lung and liver homogenates. No significant levels of adducts were detected in the lungs of air control animals. Benzoyl N-tert-butyl aminoxyl, attributed to direct reaction of ozone with PBN, and tert-butyl hydroaminoxyl, the scission product of the hydroxyl adduct of PBN, were detected in the lungs of ozone exposed rats. EPR signals for carbon-centred alkoxyl and alkyl adducts were also detected with PBN in the lungs and liver of animals exposed to ozone. With POBN, only carbon-centred alkyl radicals were detected. Senescent, 24 months old rats were found to retain about twice more PBN in blood, heart and lungs by comparison to juvenile, 2 months old animals. Accordingly, the EPR signals were generally stronger in the lungs of the senescent rats by comparison to juvenile rats. Together, the observations were consistent with the previously proposed notion that a significant flux of hydrogen peroxide produced from the reaction of ozone with lipids of the extracellular lining, or from activated macrophages in the lungs could be a source of biologically relevant amounts of hydroxyl radical."

However, nothing is known about its potential effects against other environmental sources of oxidative stress such as ozone (O3) in skin. Intake of oral beta-carotene supplements before exposure to sunlight (and thus inevitably also to (O3) has been recommended on a population-wide basis. However, although some studies have shown beta-carotene as providing skin protection as an antioxidant, other studies using skin cells in culture have shown that beta-carotene may have unexpected prooxidant properties (Obermuller-Jevic, et al., 2001). Given this, there is an ongoing debate regarding the protective or potentially harmful role(s) of beta-carotene in human skin. In this study, the effect of beta-carotene on ozone's effects on the skin of hairless mice was assessed. After feeding a diet supplemented with 0.5% beta-carotene for 1 month, mice were subjected to O3 exposure (0.8 ppm 6 h/day; 7 days) and the induction of proinflammatory markers such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFalpha), macrophage inflammatory protein 2 (MIP2), and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), and markers of oxidative stress, heme-oxygenase-1 (HO-1), were quantitated. The data showed that beta-carotene downregulated the induction of TNFalpha, MIP2, iNOS, and HO-1 in response to O3. We conclude that beta-carotene provides protection against O3-induced skin oxidative stress in vivo, which is consistent with a protective role for beta-carotene in the skin."

Skin turnover and regeneration are largely dependent on extracellular matrix metabolism, which is under the control of matrix metalloproteinases, MMPs. The present study evaluated cutaneous MMPs activity upon environmental pollutants exposure and analyzed the response of old and young animals. For this purpose, SKH-1 hairless mice (8 weeks and 18 months old) were exposed for 6h/day to 0.25ppm of O(3) or to UV radiation (0.3 MED) or to CS for 4 days. Gelatin zymography revealed an increase of MMP-2 in both young and old animals, after exposure to pollutants, while MMP-9, undetectable in unexposed subjects, was strongly induced only in old mice. Casein zymography and Western blot analysis showed an increase of MMP-12 in the aged group after environmental stressors exposure. TIMP-1 and -2 expression levels did not change. The current study demonstrates the ability of certain environmental pollutants to affect the ECM turnover through modulation of specific MMPs, and confirms the higher susceptibility of old subjects to exogenous pro-oxidant insults."

Among the latter, ozone (O3) is of particular concern because of its high and dominating presence in photochemical smog. It is well known that O3 depletes small molecular weight antioxidants, oxidizes proteins, induces lipid peroxidation and activates cellular responses in various tissues. Using an in vivo model (SKH-1 hairless mice), the interaction between O3 exposure (0. 5 ppm ? 6 h/day) and age was examined in relation to cutaneous wound healing. Compared to younger (8 weeks) mice, older (18 months) mice exposed to O3 (day 0 to day 9 after wounding) exhibited delayed wound closure, increased lipid peroxidation (measured as 4-HNE protein adducts) and protein oxidation (measured as carbonyls concentration) and decreased levels of P-I?B? and TGF? protein. These findings support the hypothesis that oxidant pollutant exposure and age interact so as to disrupt normal wound healing processes."

Methods: We performed a meta-analysis of 144 effect estimates from 39 time-series studies, and estimated pooled effects by lags, age groups, cause-specific mortality, and concentration metrics. We compared results with pooled estimates from the National Morbidity, Mortality, and Air Pollution Study (NMMAPS), a time-series study of 95 large U.S. urban centers from 1987 to 2000.
Results: Both meta-analysis and NMMAPS results provided strong evidence of a short-term association between ozone and mortality, with larger effects for cardiovascular and respiratory mortality, the elderly, and current-day ozone exposure. In both analyses, results were insensitive to adjustment for particulate matter and model specifications. In the meta-analysis, a 10-ppb increase in daily ozone at single-day or 2-day average of lags 0, 1, or 2 days was associated with an 0.87% increase in total mortality (95% posterior interval = 0.55% to 1.18%), whereas the lag 0 NMMAPS estimate is 0.25% (0.12% to 0.39%). Several findings indicate possible publication bias: meta-analysis results were consistently larger than those from NMMAPS; meta-analysis pooled estimates at lags 0 or 1 were larger when only a single lag was reported than when estimates for multiple lags were reported; and heterogeneity of city-specific estimates in the meta-analysis were larger than with NMMAPS.
Conclusions: This study provides evidence of short-term associations between ozone and mortality as well as evidence of publication bias."

Methods: We conducted a review and meta-analysis of short-term ozone mortality studies, identified unresolved issues, and conducted an additional time-series analysis for 7 U.S. cities (Chicago, Detroit, Houston, Minneapolis-St. Paul, New York City, Philadelphia, and St. Louis). Results: Our review found a combined estimate of 0.39% (95% confidence interval = 0.26-0.51%) per 10-ppb increase in 1-hour daily maximum ozone for the all-age nonaccidental cause/single pollutant model (43 studies). Adjusting for the funnel plot asymmetry resulted in a slightly reduced estimate (0.35%; 0.23- 0.47%). In a subset for which particulate matter (PM) data were available (15 studies), the corresponding estimates were 0.40% (0.27-0.53%) for ozone alone and 0.37% (0.20-0.54%) with PM in model. The estimates for warm seasons were generally larger than those for cold seasons. Our additional time-series analysis found that including PM in the model did not substantially reduce the ozone risk estimates. However, the difference in the weather adjustment model could result in a 2-fold difference in risk estimates (eg, 0.24% to 0.49% in multicity combined estimates across alternative weather models for the ozone-only all-year case). Conclusions: Overall, the results suggest short-term associations between ozone and daily mortality in the majority of the cities, although the estimates appear to be heterogeneous across cities."

We conducted an empiric Bayes metaregression to estimate the ozone effect on mortality, and to assess whether this effect varies as a function of hypothesized confounders or effect modifiers. METHODS: We gathered 71 time-series studies relating ozone to all-cause mortality, and we selected 48 estimates from 28 studies for the metaregression. Metaregression covariates included the relationship between ozone concentrations and concentrations of other air pollutants, proxies for personal exposure-ambient concentration relationships, and the statistical methods used in the studies. For our metaregression, we applied a hierarchical linear model with known level-1 variances. RESULTS: We estimated a grand mean of a 0.21% increase (95% confidence interval = 0.16-0.26%) in mortality per 10-microg/m increase of 1-hour maximum ozone (0.41% increase per 10 ppb) without controlling for other air pollutants. In the metaregression, air-conditioning prevalence and lag time were the strongest predictors of between-study variability. Air pollution covariates yielded inconsistent findings in regression models, although correlation analyses indicated a potential influence of summertime PM2.5. CONCLUSIONS: These findings, coupled with a greater relative risk of ozone in the summer versus the winter, demonstrate that geographic and seasonal heterogeneity in ozone relative risk should be anticipated, but that the observed relationship between ozone and mortality should be considered for future regulatory impact analyses."

Effect estimates were obtained for each city with city-specific models and were combined using second-stage regression models. No significant effects were observed during the cold half of the year. For the warm season, an increase in the 1-hour ozone concentration by 10 mug/m3 was associated with a 0.33% (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.17-0.52) increase in the total daily number of deaths, 0.45% (95% CI, 0.22-0.69) in the number of cardiovascular deaths, and 1.13% (95% CI, 0.62-1.48) in the number of respiratory deaths. The corresponding figures for the 8-hour ozone were similar. The associations with total mortality were independent of SO2 and particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter less than 10 mum (PM10) but were somewhat confounded by NO2 and CO. Individual city estimates were heterogeneous for total (a higher standardized mortality rate was associated with larger effects) and cardiovascular mortality (larger effects were observed in southern cities).

RESULTS: Analysis was hindered by data availability. In the 93 communities with PM10 data, only 25.0% of study days had data on both ozone and PM10. In the 91 communities with PM2.5 data, only 9.2% of days in the study period had data on ozone and PM2.5. Neither PM measure was highly correlated with ozone at any level of ozone or PM. National and community-specific effect estimates of the short-term effects of ozone on mortality were robust to inclusion of PM10 or PM(2.)5 in time-series models. The robustness remains even at low ozone levels (< 10 ppb) using a subset approach.CONCLUSIONS: Results provide evidence that neither PM10 nor PM(2.)5 is a likely confounder of observed ozone and mortality relationships.

Objectives: Generally, studies use Poisson regression, with complicated modeling strategies, to control for season and weather, raising concerns that the results may be sensitive to these modeling protocols. For studies of ozone, weather control is a particular problem because high ozone days are generally quite hot. 
Methods: The case-crossover approach converts this problem into a case-control study, where the control for each person is the same person on a day near in time, when he or she did not die. This method controls for season and individual risk factors by matching. One can also choose the control day to have the same temperature as the event day. 
Measurements: I have applied this approach to a study of over one million deaths in 14 US cities. 
Main Results: I found that, with matching on temperature, a 10 ppb increase in maximum hourly ozone concentrations was associated with a 0.23% (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.01%, 0.44%) increase in the risk of dying. This finding was indistinguishable from the risk when only matching on season and controlling for temperature with regression splines (0.19%; 95% CI 03%, 0.35%). Control for suspended particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter of 10Am or less (PM10) did not change this risk. However, the association was restricted to the warm months (0.37% increase; 95% CI 0.11%, 0.62%), with no effect in the cold months.

Their study included data on 98 US urban communities for 1987 to 2000 from the National Morbidity, Mortality, and Air Pollution Study; US Census; and American Housing Survey. On average across the communities, a 10-ppb increase in the previous week's ozone level was associated with a 0.52% (95% posterior interval: 0.28, 0.77) increase in mortality. The authors found that community-level characteristics modify the relation between ozone and mortality. Higher effect estimates were associated with higher unemployment, fraction of the Black/African-American population, and public transportation use and with lower temperatures or prevalence of central air conditioning. These differences may relate to underlying health status, differences in exposure, or other factors.

Results were adjusted for long-term trends, day-of-the week and humidex. RESULTS: Interquartile increases in particulate matter (PM(10) and PM(2.5)), sulphur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide, carbon monoxide, and elemental and organic carbon were associated with a 4-7% increase in mortality among those who did not complete primary school (p<0.05) vs. 0.5-1.5% among university graduates (p>0.05). Among those at least 85 years of age respective estimates were 2-7%. However, among the elderly who did not complete primary school, respective estimates were 11-19% (p<0.05). The degree of effect modification was less for income and employment status than education, and sex did not modify the results.

Despite the ample literature on adaptation of inflammatory and pulmonary responses to ozone, and the link, in cohort studies, between lung function and mortality risk there has been little done to date to examine the question of adaptation in the acute mortality risk associated with ambient ozone.

Methods: We applied a case-crossover design in 48 US cities to examine the ozone effect by season, by month and by age groups, particularly focusing on whether there was an adaptation effect.

Results: We found that the same day ozone effect was highest in summer with a 0.5% (95% CI: 0.38, 0.62) increase in total mortality for 10 ppb increase in 8-hr ozone, whilst the effect decrease to null in autumn and winter. We found higher effects in the months May- July with a 0.46% (95% CI: 0.24, 0.68) increase in total mortality for 10 ppb increase in ozone in June, and a 0.65% (95% CI: 0.47, 0.82) increase in mortality during July. The effect decreased in August and became null in September. We found similar effects from the age group 51-60 up to age 80 and a lower effect in 80 years and older.

Conclusion: The mortality effects of ozone appear diminished later in the ozone season, reaching the null effect previously reported in winter by September. More work should address this issue and examine the biological mechanism of adaptation."

OBJECTIVES: We addressed the question of whether the ozone-mortality relationship is entirely a reflection of the adverse effect of ozone, or whether it is, at least in part, an effect of other secondary pollutants.

METHODS: Separate time-series models were fit to 3-6 years of data between 2000 and 2005 from 18 U.S. communities. The association between nonaccidental mortality was examined with ozone alone and with ozone after adjustment for fine particle mass, sulfate, organic carbon, or nitrate concentrations. The effect estimates from each of these models were pooled using a random-effects meta-analysis to obtain an across-community average.

RESULTS: We found a 0.89% [95% confidence interval (CI), 0.45-1.33%] increase in nonaccidental mortality with a 10-ppb increase in same-day 24-hr summertime ozone across the 18 communities. After adjustment for PM(2.5) (particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter <or= 2.5 microm) mass or nitrate, this estimate decreased slightly; but when adjusted for particle sulfate, the estimate was substantially reduced to 0.58% (95% CI, -0.33 to 1.49%).

However, little is known about which subpopulations are more susceptible to death related to ozone. METHODS: We conducted a case-only study in 48 US cities to identify subpopulations particularly vulnerable to ozone air pollution. Mortality and ozone data were obtained for the period 1989-2000 (May through September of each year) for 2,729,640 decedents. For each potential effect modifier, we fitted city-specific logistic regression models and pooled the results across all cities. Additionally, we examined differences in susceptibility factors according to several city characteristics using a meta-regression. RESULTS: For each 10 ppb increase in ozone (average of lags 0 to 2), people aged > or =65 years had a 1.10% (95% confidence interval = 0.44% to 1.77%) additional increase in mortality (compared with younger ages). Other groups that were particularly susceptible were black people (additional 0.53% [0.19% to 0.87%]), women (additional 0.58% [0.18% to 0.98%]), and those with atrial fibrillation (additional 1.66% [0.03% to 3.32%]). Susceptibility factors had a larger effect in cities with lower ozone levels. For instance, the additional increase in ozone-related mortality for the elderly was 1.48% (0.81% to 2.15%) in a city with a mean ozone level of 42 ppb versus 0.45% (-0.27% to 1.19%) in a city with a level of 51 ppb. CONCLUSIONS: We confirmed the susceptibility of the elderly to die of ambient ozone and identified other vulnerable subpopulations including women, blacks, and those with atrial fibrillation. Differences in vulnerability were particularly marked in cities with lower ozone concentrations."

We investigate this intercity variability, as well as the sensitivity of the ozone- mortality associations to modeling assumptions and choice of daily ozone metric, based on reanalysis of data from the National Morbidity, Mortality and Air Pollution Study (NMMAPS). Previous work from NMMAPS reported a statistically significant association between ambient 24-h ozone and short-term mortality when averaged across 98U.S. cities. Separation of ozone health associations from effects due to weather and co-pollutants is central to their interpretation. We examined the sensitivity of city-specific ozone-mortality estimates to adjustments for confounders and effect modifiers, showing substantial sensitivity. We examined ozone-mortality associations in different concentration ranges, finding a larger incremental effect in higher ranges, but also larger uncertainty. Alternative ozone exposure metrics defined by maximum 8-h averages or 1-h maxima show different ozone-mortality associations that cannot be explained by simple scaling relationships. The emphasis in earlier studies based on NMMAPS has been on the reporting of ?national? effects, together with prediction intervals that suggest that these national values are precisely estimated. Our view is that ozone-mortality associations, based on time-series epidemiologic analyses of daily data from multiple cities, reveal still-unexplained inconsistencies and show sensitivity to modeling choices and data selection that contribute to serious uncertainties when epidemiological results are used to discern the nature and magnitude of possible ozone-mortality relationships or are applied to risk assessment."

That fixed-effects generalized-least-squares approach analyzes the multiple outcomes jointly within a single model, and it can include covariates, such as duration of therapy or quality of trial, that may explain observed heterogeneity of results among the trials. Sometimes the covariates explain all the heterogeneity, and the fixed-effects regression model is appropriate. However, unexplained heterogeneity may often remain, even after taking into account known or suspected covariates. Because fixed-effects models do not make allowance for this remaining unexplained heterogeneity, the potential exists for bias in estimated coefficients, standard errors and p-values. We propose two random-effects approaches for the regression meta-analysis of multiple correlated outcomes. We compare their use with fixed-effects models and with separate-outcomes models in a meta-analysis of periodontal clinical trials. A simulation study shows the advantages of the random-effects approach. These methods also facilitate meta-analysis of trials that compare more than two treatments."

Conventional investigation of such effect modification through interaction terms in time-series regression analysis depends on hard-to-verify modeling assumptions, and can be computationally unwieldy. As an alternative, we investigate the use of case-only approaches originally proposed for studying gene-environment interactions.

METHODS: We consider an investigation of whether persons of low socio-economic status (SES) are more susceptible to the effect of high outside temperatures on mortality. If low SES persons are more prevalent among deaths on hot days than on days with more moderate temperatures, then this suggests the group is more susceptible. Extending the case-only theory developed for gene-environment interactions allows this to be described more quantitatively.

RESULTS: Conventionally based analysis estimated that mortality in the Sao Paulo rose by 2.3% (SE 0.3%) for each degree of increase in outside temperature above 20 degrees C. This effect was greater by 1.11% (SE 0.72) in the lowest compared with highest quartile of SES. Case-only analysis estimated the difference in effect to be 1.14% (SE 0.72).

CONCLUSION: The simplicity and reduced assumptions of the case-only approach provide an advantage over conventional analysis, although the approach gives information only on modification, not main effects."

However, these short-term effects might plausibly vary by season. Changes in the sources of air pollution and meteorology can result in changes in characteristics of the air pollution mixture across seasons. The authors developed Bayesian semiparametric hierarchical models for estimating time-varying effects of pollution on mortality in multisite time series studies. The methods were applied to the database of the National Morbidity and Mortality Air Pollution Study, which includes data for 100 US cities, for the period 1987-2000. At the national level, a 10-Ag/m3 increase in particulate matter less than 10 Am in aerodynamic diameter at a 1-day lag was associated with 0.15% (95% posterior interval (PI): -0.08, 0.39), 0.14% (95% PI: -0.14, 0.42), 0.36% (95% PI: 0.11, 0.61), and 0.14% (95% PI: -0.06, 0.34) increases in mortality for winter, spring, summer, and fall, respectively.

An assessment using the NMMAPS data,"Ren, C; Williams, GM; Mengersen, K; Morawska, L; Tong, S",2008.0,"#Many studies have indicated that ozone is associated with morbidity and mortality. A few studies have reported that the association is heterogeneous across seasons and geographic regions. However, little information is available on whether both temperature and geographic factors simultaneously modify the ozone effect. This study used a Poisson regression model to explore whether temperature modifies the effect of ozone on mortality in the 60 large eastern US communities during April to October, 1987u2000. Results show that temperature modified ozone-mortality associations and that such modification varied across geographic regions. In the northeast region, a 10-ppb increment in ozone was associated with an increase of 2.22% (95% posterior interval [PI]: 1.19%, 3.13%), 3.06% (95% PI: 2.21%, 3.76%) and 6.22% (95% PI: 4.77%, 7.56%) in mortality at low, moderate and high temperature level, respectively, while in the southeast region a 10-ppb increment in ozone was associated with an increase of 1.13% (95% PI:- 1.12%, 3.18%), 1.50% (95% PI: 0.22%, 2.81%) and 1.29% (95% PI:- 0.33%, 2.96%) in mortality, respectively. We concluded that temperature synergistically modified the ozone-mortality association in the northeast region, but such a pattern was not apparent in the southeast region. Thus, both temperature and geographic factors should be considered in the assessment of ozone effects."

We report the associations between daily maximum apparent temperature and daily deaths during the warm season in 15 European cities. METHODS: The city-specific analyses were based on generalized estimating equations and the city-specific results were combined in a Bayesian random effects meta-analysis. We specified distributed lag models in studying the delayed effect of exposure. Time-varying coefficient models were used to check the assumption of a constant heat effect over the warm season. RESULTS: The city-specific exposure-response functions have a V shape, with a change-point that varied among cities. The meta-analytic estimate of the threshold was 29.4 degrees C for Mediterranean cities and 23.3 degrees C for north-continental cities. The estimated overall change in all natural mortality associated with a 1 degrees C increase in maximum apparent temperature above the city-specific threshold was 3.12% (95% credibility interval = 0.60% to 5.72%) in the Mediterranean region and 1.84% (0.06% to 3.64%) in the north-continental region. Stronger associations were found between heat and mortality from respiratory diseases, and with mortality in the elderly. CONCLUSIONS: There is an important mortality effect of heat across Europe. The effect is evident from June through August; it is limited to the first week following temperature excess, with evidence of mortality displacement. There is some suggestion of a higher effect of early season exposures. Acclimatization and individual susceptibility need further investigation as possible explanations for the observed heterogeneity among cities."

A critical scientific and policy question is whether a threshold level exists below which O3 does not adversely affect mortality. We developed and applied several statistical models to data on air pollution, weather, and mortality for 98 U.S. urban communities for the period 1987?2000 to estimate the exposure?response curve for tropospheric O3 and risk of mortality and to evaluate whether a ?safe? threshold level exists. Methods included a linear approach and subset, threshold, and spline models. All results indicate that any threshold would exist at very low concentrations, far below current U.S. and international regulations and nearing background levels. For example, under a scenario in which the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency?s 8-hr regulation is met every day in each community, there was still a 0.30% increase in mortality per 10-ppb increase in the average of the same and previous days? O3 levels (95% posterior interval, 0.15?0.45%). Our findings indicate that even low levels of tropospheric O3 are associated with increased risk of premature mortality. Interventions to further reduce O3 pollution would benefit public health, even in regions that meet current regulatory standards and guidelines."

Using a new semi-parametric time series modelling approach, which incorporates non-linearity and latent cumulative variables, we show that the cumulative effects on health due to continual exposure to environmental pollutants can be very serious even at levels below the national ambient air quality standards of America (NAAQS). The situation is especially worrying for chronic sufferers. Our study suggests that different pollutants may require different cumulative periods (on average) to impact on health but they share a similar functional form in respect of their impact.

Overall, PM10 (usually 200-day accumulation) and ozone (3-day accumulation) were the two important predictors of outcome but their effect was not uniform across the nine cities. Many models exhibited thresholds (25-45 mu m g/m(3) for PM10, and 10-45 ppb for O-3). Our preliminary exploratory analyses suggest that the use of a linear, no threshold, model for pollution studies is not consistent with the observed data. The heterogeneity in the risk estimates across the nine cities suggests combining the local risk estimates to obtain a national risk estimate may not be justifiable and the estimate is likely to be confounded.

Methods  3535 children with no history of asthma were recruited from schools in 12 communities in southern California and were followed up for up to 5 years. 265 children reported a new diagnosis of asthma during follow-up. We assessed risk of asthma in children playing team sports at study entry in six communities with high daytime ozone concentrations, six with lower concentrations, and in communities with high or low concentrations of nitrogen dioxide, particulate matter, and inorganic-acid vapour. 
Findings  In communities with high ozone concentrations, the relative risk of developing asthma in children playing three or more sports was 3A3 (95% CI 1A9-5A8), compared with children playing no sports. Sports had no effect in areas of low ozone concentration (0A8, 0A4-1A6). Time spent outside was associated with a higher incidence of asthma in areas of high ozone (1A4, 1A0-2A1), but not in areas of low ozone. Exposure to pollutants other than ozone did not alter the effect of team sports.

We evaluated cross-sectionally the effects of air pollution exposures based on data collected in 1986-1990 by existing monitoring stations and data collected by our study team in 1994. Expected relationships were seen between demographic, physical, and other environmental factors and pulmonary function values. When the data were stratified by sex, an association was seen between pollution levels and lower pulmonary function in female subjects, with the associations being stronger for the 1994 exposure data than the 1986-1990 data. After adjustment, PM10, PM2.5, and NO2 were each significantly associated with lower FVC, FEV1, and maximal midexpiratory flow (MMEF); acid vapor with lower FVC, FEV1, peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR), and MMEF; and O3 with lower PEFR and MMEF. Effects were generally larger in those girls spending more time outdoors. Stepwise regression of adjusted pulmonary function values for girls in the 12 communities showed that NO2 was most strongly associated with lower FVC (r = -0.74, p < 0.01), PM2.5 with FEV1 (r = -0.72, p < 0.01), O3 with PEFR (r = -0.75, p < 0.005), and PM2.5 with MMEF (r = -0.80, p < 0.005). There was a statistically significant association between ozone exposure and decreased FVC and FEV1 in girls with asthma. For boys, significant associations were seen between peak O3 exposures and lower FVC and FEV1, but only in those spending more time outdoors. These findings underline the importance of follow-up of this cohort."

However, there has been little study of effects of traffic exposure at school on new onset asthma.

Objectives: To evaluate the relationship of new onset asthma with traffic-related pollution near homes and schools.

Methods: Parent-reported physician diagnosis of new onset asthma (N=120) was identified during three years of follow-up of a cohort of 2497 kindergarten and first grade children who were asthma- and wheezing-free at study entry into the southern California Children?s Health Study. Traffic-related pollution exposure was assessed based on a line source dispersion model of traffic volume, distance from home and school, and local meteorology. Regional ambient ozone, nitrogen dioxide (NO2), and particulate matter were measured continuously at one central site monitor in each of 13 study communities. Hazard ratios (HRs) for new onset asthma were scaled to the range of ambient central site pollutants and to the residential inter-quartile range for each traffic exposure metric.

Results: Asthma risk increased with modeled traffic-related pollution exposure from roadways near homes (HR 1.51; 95% confidence interval 1.25-1.82) and near schools (HR 1.45;1.06-1.98). Ambient NO2 measured at a central site in each community was also associated with increased risk (HR 2.18;1.18-4.01). In models with both NO2 and modeled traffic exposures, there were independent associations of asthma with traffic-related pollution at school and home, while the estimate for NO2 was attenuated (HR 1.37;0.69,2.71).

Conclusions: Traffic-related pollution exposure at school and homes may both contribute to the development of asthma."

METHODS: Associations of the well characterised null variant of GSTM1 and four single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that characterised common variation in the GSTP1 locus with new onset asthma in a cohort of 1610 school children were examined. Children's exercise and ozone exposure were classified using participation in team sports and community annual average ozone levels, respectively. RESULTS: A two SNP model involving putatively functional variants (rs6591255, rs1695 (Ile105Va)) best captured the association between GSTP1 and asthma. The risk of asthma was lower for those with the Val allele of Ile105Val (hazard ratio (HR) 0.60, 95% CI 0.4 to 0.8) and higher for the variant allele of rs6591255 (HR 1.40, 95% CI 1.1 to 1.9). The risk of asthma increased with level of exercise among ile(105) homozygotes but not among those with at least one val(105) allele (interaction p value = 0.02). The risk was highest among ile(105) homozygotes who participated in >or=3 sports in the high ozone communities (HR 6.15, 95% CI 2.2 to 7.4). GSTM1 null was independently associated with an increased risk of asthma and showed little variation with air pollution or GSTP1 genotype. These results were consistent in two independent fourth grade cohorts recruited in 1993 and 1996. CONCLUSION: Children who inherit a val(105) variant allele may be protected from the increased risk of asthma associated with exercise, especially in high ozone communities. GSTM1 null genotype was associated with an increased risk of asthma."

Objective This study investigated whether GSTP1 genotypes and outdoor air pollution were interactive risk factors on childhood asthma.
Methods Four hundred and thirty-six subjects were recruited for oral mucosa samplings from 2853 fourth- to ninth-grade schoolchildren from three districts with different air pollution levels in southern Taiwan. PCR-based assays were performed by oral mucosa DNA to determine GSTP1 genotypes. We also conducted a nested case-control study comprising 61 asthmatic children and 95 controls confirmed by International Study of Asthma and Allergies in Childhood questionnaire results and methacholine challenge test. Multiple logistic regression was used to adjust for potential confounding factors.
Results All participants were homozygous at the Ala-114 locus. Although only a marginally significant association existed between the frequency of homozygosity at the Ile-105 locus and asthma when air pollution was not considered, we found a significant gene-environmental interaction between GSTP1-105 alleles and air pollution after adjusting for confounders (P=0.035). Specifically, we found that compared with participants carrying any Val-105 allele in low air pollution, those who are Ile-105 homozygotes in high air pollution district had a significantly increased risk of asthma (adjusted odds ratio (AOR)=5.52, 95% confidence interval (CI)=1.64-21.25). Compared with participants carrying any Val-105 allele, in high air pollution district, children with Ile-105 homozygotes had a significantly increased risk of asthma (AOR=3.79, 95% CI=1.01-17.08), but those who carried two Ile-105 alleles in low or moderate air pollution districts did not show similar tendencies. The risk of asthma also revealed a clear dose-response relationship with outdoor air pollution in children with Ile-105 homozygotes.
Conclusion Our result suggests a gene-environmental interaction between GSTP1-105 genotypes and outdoor air pollution on childhood asthma."

We ascertained respiratory illness-related school absences using an active surveillance system from January 1996 through June 1996. Genotypes for GSTM1 (null versus present), GSTT1 (null versus present), and GSTP1 (lle 105Val) were determined using genomic DNA from buccal cell specimens. The effects of GST genotypes on respiratory illness were assessed using stratified absence incidence rates and Poisson regression models. GSTP1 genotype was associated with risk for respiratory illness severe enough to result in a school absence. Children who were homozygous for the Val105 variant allele had lower incidence rates of upper and lower respiratory illnesses than did children who were homozygous for the Val105 allele. Children inheriting at least one Val105 allele were protected from respiratory illnesses (relative risk, 0.80; 95% confidence interval, 0.65-0.99).

Whether chronic effects result from long-term exposure to any of these pollutants during childhood is an important unresolved question. Establishing whether acute or chronic effects result from childhood exposure and identifying sensitive subgroups may require integration of biologic mechanisms of lung defenses, injury, and response into the study design and statistical models used in analyses. This review explores the theoretical basis for explaining such adverse effects in light of our contemporary understanding of mechanisms of lung injury and response at the cellular and molecular levels. The rapidly evolving understanding of the effects of air pollution on cellular and molecular levels presents an opportunity to develop and refine innovative biologically based hypotheses about the effects of childhood exposure. We hypothesize that children with low fruit and vegetable intake, low antioxidant levels, high polyunsaturated fat intake, or who have inherited certain alleles for genes involved in lung defenses and immune response regulation may be at increased risk for adverse effects. Because responses to air pollutants of interest are complex and involve a number of pathophysiologic processes, the magnitude of main effects of dietary factors, genes, and gene-environment interactions may be modest for individuals; however, each may make an important contribution to the population burden of preventable respiratory diseases."

whether variants affect susceptibility to maternal smoking.
METHODS: Four haplotype tagging SNPs were selected that accounted for 83% of the common
haplotypic variation in GSTP1. The associations of GSTP1 variants with asthma and wheezing
were assessed among white children in the Children?s Health Study (CHS).
RESULTS: The Ile105Val allele and a SNP in the upstream promoter region (SNP1: rs6591255,

OBJECTIVE: To determine the factors associated with oxidative stress including asthma severity and the genotype of the antioxidant enzymes. METHODS: A total of 196 children with mild asthma, 116 children with moderate-severe asthma, and 2 healthy control groups (187 and 68 children) were included in the study. Plasma levels of malondialdehyde were measured as the indicator of oxidative stress, and reduced glutathione levels as the indicator of antioxidant defense. Children were genotyped for null variants of glutathione S transferase (GST) T1 and GSTM1, and ile105val variant of GSTP1. Risk factors were analyzed with multivariate logistic regression. RESULTS: Systemic levels of malondialdehyde increased and reduced glutathione levels decreased significantly from healthy controls to patients with mild asthma and then to patients with moderate-severe asthma (P < .001 for each). Multivariate logistic regression identified asthma and asthma severity as independent factors associated with oxidative stress (odds ratio between 17 and 56; P < .001). Children with asthma with GSTP1 val/val genotype had higher malondialdehyde and lower glutathione levels compared with other genotypes (P = .023 and P = .014, respectively). GSTP1 val/val genotype was independently associated with asthma severity (odds ratio, 4.210; 95% CI, 1.581-11.214; P = .004). CONCLUSION: Our study indicates the presence of a strong oxidative stress in children with asthma that increases with the severity of the disease.

Although much attention has been directed toward measurements of exhaled NO in asthma, no studies to date have evaluated levels of plasma arginase or arginine, the substrate for NO production, in patients with asthma. This study, therefore, measured amino acid levels, arginase activity, and nitric oxide metabolites in the blood of patients with asthma, as well as NO in exhaled breath. Although levels of virtually all amino acids were reduced, patients with asthma exhibited a striking reduction in plasma arginine levels compared with normal control subjects without asthma (45 +/- 22 vs. 94 +/- 29 microM, p < 0.0001), and serum arginase activity was elevated (1.6 +/- 0.8 vs. 0.5 +/- 0.3 micromol/ml/hour, asthma vs. control, p < 0.0001).

It included 2,445 children from the 8th and 9th school grades who had been living for at least 3 years in an area where some communities undergo the heaviest photochemical exposure in France. Data on rhinitis, asthmatic symptoms, and asthma prevalence were gathered with the ISAAC paper and video questionnaires. The relation between level of air pollutants and asthma was assessed first by comparison of crude prevalence rates (chi-square test), and then by simple regression analysis and multiple logistic regression analysis. No consistent association between mean SO2 and NO2 levels, and prevalence of rhinitis, asthma, or asthmatic symptoms could be demonstrated. In contrast, there were statistically significant associations between prevalence of asthmatic symptoms and mean ozone O3) concentration. The interpretation of such findings is not straightforward, as these symptoms can be interpreted either as respiratory irritation due to exposure to nonspecific airway stimuli or as a true asthmatic state. Additional studies are required to clarify this important issue. In conclusion, this large cross-sectional epidemiologic survey performed in an area of high photochemical air pollution did demonstrate statistically significant associations between the prevalence of asthmatic symptoms and mean O3 concentration."

We observed a statistically significant association between outdoor air pollution and asthma, after controlling for potential confound variables. Total suspended particulate, nitrogen dioxide, carbon monoxide, ozone, and airborne dust particles all displayed an independent association with asthma, respectively. There were no selection biases in this community-based study, which provides evidence that passive smoking and long-term, high average outdoor air pollution are independent risk factors of asthma."

Data included how frequently subjects purchased medication and the respiratory symptoms recorded by clinic and hospital personnel. Pulmonary function tests were administered to 20% of the total study population, which was selected randomly. Data about monthly levels of air pollutants (i.e., particulate matter 10 Am and less [PM10], ozone [O3], sulfur dioxide [SO2], and nitrogen dioxide [NO2]) were provided by Taiwan's Environmental Protection Agency. The prevalence rates of asthma were correlated significantly with NO2 (r= .63) and 03 (r= .51) concentrations. Levels of NO2 and PM10 were correlated significantly with monthly hospital admissions. Forced vital capacity, forced expiratory volume in 1 sec, and peak expiratory flow for asthmatics in central Taiwan were 6-11 % lower than normal predicted values for the general Taiwanese student population, adjusted for age, height, and weight. In conclusion, the increased risk of asthma and the frequency of monthly hospital admissions among asthmatics may be correlated positively with pollution levelsuespecially NO2 and PM10."

However, no epidemiological data are available. METHODS: To clarify this issue, we performed a cross-sectional epidemiological survey in 2604 primary school children, 10 and 11 years old, living in seven communities among which some have the highest photochemical exposure in France. The mean levels of the main gaseous air pollutants (SO2, NO2 and O3) were measured during a 2-month period in 1993. The protocol included a standardized questionnaire, skin prick tests to common aeroallergens and in the atopic children, collection of a sample of mattress dust to measure group 1 mite allergens. Atopy was only defined on the basis of the skin prick tests. RESULTS: Percentage of positive skin tests and the number of positive skin tests were similar in the different communities looked at. The distribution of dust samples with a group 1 allergen level greater than 2 microg/g dust, was also similar. Logistic regression analysis including potential confounding factors, as well as the mean level of air pollutants, did not demonstrate any association between atopy and mean SO2, NO2 and O3 levels. CONCLUSION: The increase in photochemical air pollutants is unlikely to be a major determinant for the recent increase in the prevalence of atopy."

To assess the effect of air pollutants on the risk of asthma among school children, a nationwide cross sectional study of 32 672 Taiwanese school children was conducted in 2001.

Methods: Routine air pollution monitoring data for sulphur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen oxides (NOx), ozone (O3), carbon monoxide (CO), and particles with an aerodynamic diameter of 10 ?m or less (PM10) were used. Information on individual characteristics and indoor environments was from a parent administered questionnaire (response rate 93%). The exposure parameters were calculated using the mean of the 2000 monthly averages. The effect estimates were presented as odds ratios (ORs) per 10 ppb changes for SO2, NOx, and O3, 100 ppb changes for CO, and 10 ?g/m3 changes for PM10.

Results: In a two stage hierarchical model adjusting for confounding, the risk of childhood asthma was positively associated with O3 (adjusted OR 1.138, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.001 to 1.293), CO (adjusted OR 1.045, 95% CI 1.017 to 1.074), and NOx (adjusted OR 1.005, 95% CI 0.954 to 1.117). Against our prior hypothesis, the risk of childhood asthma was weakly or not related to SO2 (adjusted OR 0.874, 95% CI 0.729 to 1.054) and PM10 (adjusted OR 0.934, 95% CI 0.909 to 0.960).

Conclusions: The results are consistent with the hypothesis that long term exposure to traffic related outdoor air pollutants such as NOx, CO, and O3 increases the risk of asthma in children."

Ninety-five of the original 478 children that completed the questionnaires, mentioned to have at least one of asthma symptoms (wheeze, dyspnea or cough) and were therefore evaluated by spirometry. FEV(1) was in average 89.7% for asthmatics and 102.8% for non-asthmatics. For the studied sample the risk was higher for girls with a tendency to be higher from 8 to 10years old. Lifetime prevalence of childhood asthma at the exposed area was 9.2%. Children living at the exposed area had 3 times higher risk of having asthma than those living at the unexposed area. Considering that ozone concentrations were the main difference between both areas, it can be suggested that ozone pollution increased asthma prevalence. Nevertheless, it should be remarked that further studies should be done to confirm these results."

Pollutant concentrations were monitored and data concerning asthma prevalence were collected through a questionnaire. The studied population consisted of 478 children aged 6-13 years old enrolled in four schools of the municipalities where monitoring was performed. Remote sites were identified with very low concentrations of nitrogen dioxide and volatile organic compounds and high concentrations of O-3. The prevalence of wheeze for lifetime period and in the past year was 15.9% and 6.3%, respectively. Asthmatic children were identified when dyspnoea and wheezing were simultaneously mentioned in the absence of upper respiratory infections; according to that, the lifetime prevalence of asthmatic symptoms at the remote sites was 7.1%. The comparison with other previous studies was difficult because the criteria for analysis are not conveniently established.

Outdoor air pollution is a recognized asthma trigger, but it is unclear whether exposure influences incident disease. We investigated the effect of exposure to ambient air pollution in utero and during the first year of life on risk of subsequent asthma diagnosis in a population-based nested casecontrol study.Methods: We assessed all children born in southwestern British Columbia in 1999 and 2000 (n = 37,401) for incidence of asthma diagnosis up to 34 years of age using outpatient and hospitalization records. Asthma cases were age- and sex-matched to five randomly chosen controls from the eligible cohort. We estimated each individual's exposure to ambient air pollution for the gestational period and first year of life using high-resolution pollution surfaces derived from regulatory monitoring data as well as land use regression models adjusted for temporal variation. We used logistic regression analyses to estimate effects of carbon monoxide, nitric oxide, nitrogen dioxide, particulate matter </= 10 microm and </= 2.5 microm in aerodynamic diameter (PM10 and PM2.5), ozone, sulfur dioxide, black carbon, woodsmoke, and proximity to roads and point sources on asthma diagnosis.Results: A total of 3,482 children (9%) were classified as asthma cases. We observed a statistically significantly increased risk of asthma diagnosis with increased early life exposure to CO, NO, NO2, PM10, SO2, and black carbon and proximity to point sources. Traffic-related pollutants were associated with the highest risks: adjusted odds ratio = 1.08 (95% confidence interval, 1.041.12) for a 10-microg/m3 increase of NO, 1.12 (1.071.17) for a 10-microg/m3 increase in NO2, and 1.10 (1.061.13) for a 100-microg/m3 increase in CO. These data support the hypothesis that early childhood exposure to air pollutants plays a role in development of asthma. Editor's SummaryAir pollution has been consistently associated with asthma symptoms, but relatively few studies have evaluated early life exposures and asthma onset. Clark et al. (p. 284) conducted a nested population-based casecontrol study of childhood asthma diagnosed up to 34 years of age among children born in southwestern British Columbia in 1999 and 2000, including 3,482 eligible cases (with a history of hospitalization or at least two asthma diagnoses) and 17,410 age- and sex-matched controls. Administrative and health care data were used to identify eligible children and obtain information on residential histories and potential confounders. Air pollution exposures during pregnancy and the first year of life [specifically, to carbon monoxide, nitric oxide, nitrogen dioxide, particulate matter </= 10 microm (PM10) and </= 2.5 microm (PM2.5) in aerodynamic diameter, ozone, sulfur dioxide, black carbon, woodsmoke, and proximity to major roads and industrial point sources] were estimated using regulatory monitoring data and land use regression models adjusted for temporal variation. Early life exposures to CO, NO, NO2, PM10, SO2, black carbon, and industrial point sources were positively associated with asthma, with the strongest associations noted for traffic-related pollutants. The authors conclude that results support effects of early exposure to air pollutants on the development of childhood asthma."

Methods: In a prospective study, we investigated the factors affecting wheezing before the age of three years and their relation to wheezing at six years of age. Of 1246 newborns in the Tucson, Arizona, area enrolled between May 1980 and October 1984, follow-up data at both three and six years of age were available for 826. For these children, assessments in infancy included measurement of cord-serum IgE levels (measured in 750 children), pulmonary-function testing before any lower respiratory tract illness had occurred (125), measurement of serum IgE levels at nine months of age (672), and questionnaires completed by the children's parents when the children were one year old (800). Assessments at six years of age included measurement of serum IgE levels (in 460), pulmonary-function testing (526), and skin allergy testing (629). 

Results: At the age of six years, 425 children (51.5 percent) had never wheezed, 164 (19.9 percent) had had at least one lower respiratory tract illness with wheezing during the first three years of life but had no wheezing at six years of age, 124 (15.0 percent) had no wheezing before the age of three years but had wheezing at the age of six years, and 113 (13.7 percent) had wheezing both before three years of age and at six years of age. The children who had wheezing before three years of age but not at the age of six had diminished airway function (length-adjusted maximal expiratory flow at functional residual capacity [Vsub maxFRC]) both before the age of one year and at the age of six years, were more likely than the other children to have mothers who smoked but not mothers with asthma, and did not have elevated serum IgE levels or skin-test reactivity. Children who started wheezing in early life and continued to wheeze at the age of six were more likely than the children who never wheezed to have mothers with a history of asthma (P<0.001), to have elevated serum IgE levels (P<0.01) and normal lung function in the first year of life, and to have elevated serum IgE levels (P<0.001) and diminished values for VmaxFRC (P<0.01) at six years of age. 

Conclusions: The majority of infants with wheezing have transient conditions associated with diminished airway function at birth and do not have increased risks of asthma or allergies later in life. In a substantial minority of infants, however, wheezing episodes are probably related to a predisposition to asthma."

Parents of a total of 3,676 fourth, seventh, and tenth graders from classrooms in 12 communities in Southern California completed questionnaires that characterized the children's histories of respiratory illness and associated risk factors. The prevalences of bronchitis, chronic phlegm, and chronic cough were investigated among children with a history of asthma, wheeze without diagnosed asthma, and neither wheeze nor asthma. Average ambient annual exposure to ozone, particulate matter (PM10 and PM2.5; </= 10 ""mu""m and < 2.5 ""mu""m in aerodynamic diameter, respectively), acid vapor, and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) was estimated from monitoring stations in each community. Positive associations between air pollution and bronchitis and phlegm were observed only among children with asthma. As PM10 increased across communities, there was a corresponding increase in the risk per interquartile range of bronchitis (odds ratio (OR) 1.4/19 ""mu""g/m3; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.1-1.8). Increased prevalence of phlegm was significantly associated with increasing exposure to all ambient pollutants except ozone. The strongest association was for NO2, based on relative risk per interquartile range in the 12 communities (OR 2.7/24 ppb; CI, 1.4-5.3). The results suggest that children with a prior diagnosis of asthma are more likely to develop persistent lower respiratory tract symptoms when exposed to air pollution in Southern California."

Symptoms, assessed yearly by questionnaire from 1996-1999, were associated with the yearly variability of particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter less than 2.5 A (odds ratio (O.R.) 1.09/Ag/m3; 95% confidence interval (C.I.) 1.01-1.17), OC(O.R. 1.41/Ag/m3; 95% C.I. 1.12-1.78), NO2 (O.R. 1.07/part per billion (ppb); 95% C.I. 1.02-1.13) and ozone (O.R. 1.06/ppb; 95% C.I. 1.00-1.12). The odds ratios associated with yearly within-community variability in air pollution were larger than the effect of the between-community four-year average concentrations. In two pollutant models, the effects of yearly variation in OC and NO2 were only modestly reduced by adjusting for other pollutants, except in a model containing both OC and NO2; the effects of all other pollutants were reduced after adjusting for OC or NO2. We conclude that OC and NO2 deserve greater attention as potential causes of the chronic symptoms of bronchitis in asthmatic children and that previous cross-sectional studies may have underestimated the risks associated with air pollution."

One genetic variant (G-308A) in the promoter region affecting the expression of this cytokine may contribute to airway inflammatory diseases, but the studies on bronchitic symptoms were still inconclusive. Because ozone produces oxidative stress, increased airway TNF, and inflammation, the associations of the TNF-308 polymorphism with bronchitic symptoms may vary by ambient ozone exposure. METHODS: We studied associations of TNF-308 genotype with bronchitic symptoms among asthmatic children in Children's Health Study. The association of TNF G-308A polymorphism with bronchitic symptoms was investigated and we also determined whether the associations vary with ambient ozone exposure. RESULTS: Asthmatic children with TNF-308 GG genotype had a significantly reduced risk of bronchitic symptoms with low-ozone exposure (adjusted OR: 0.53; 95% CI: 0.31-0.91). The risk was not reduced in children living in high-ozone communities (adjusted OR: 1.42; 95% CI: 0.75-2.70). This difference in genotypic effects between low- and high-ozone environments was statistically significant among asthmatics (P for interaction = 0.01), but insignificant among nonasthmatic children. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest a role of gene-environmental interactions on the occurrence of bronchitic symptoms among children with asthma."

The aim was to assess the relation between asthma severity during the past 12 months and home outdoor concentrations of air pollution. 

METHODS: Asthma severity over the past 12 months was assessed in two complementary ways among 328 adult asthmatics from the French Epidemiological study on the Genetics and Environment of Asthma (EGEA) examined between 1991 and 1995. The four-class severity score integrated clinical events and type of treatment. The five-level asthma score is based only on the occurrence of symptoms. Nitrogen dioxide (NO(2)), sulphur dioxide (SO(2)) and ozone (O(3)) concentrations were assigned to each residence using two different methods. The first was based on the closest monitor data from 1991 to 1995. The second consisted of spatial models that used geostatistical interpolations and then assigned air pollutants to the geo-coded residences (1998). 

RESULTS: Higher asthma severity score was significantly related to the 8-hour average of ozone during April-September (O(3)-8 h) and the number of days (O(3)-days) with 8-hour ozone averages above 110 microg.m(-3) (for a 36-day increase, equivalent to the interquartile range, in O(3)-days, odds ratio 2.22 (95% confidence interval 1.61 to 3.07) for one class difference in score). Adjustment for age, sex, smoking habits, occupational exposure, and educational level did not alter results. Asthma severity was unrelated to NO(2). Both exposure assessment methods and severity scores resulted in very similar findings. SO(2) correlated with severity but reached statistical significance only for the model-based assignment of exposure. 

CONCLUSIONS: The observed associations between asthma severity and air pollution, in particular O(3), support the hypothesis that air pollution at levels far below current standards increases asthma severity."

The ordinal ORs for O(3) and PM(10) with asthma control were 1.69 (95% CI 1.22 to 2.34) and 1.35 (95% CI 1.13 to 1.64), respectively. When including both pollutants in the same model, both associations persisted. Associations were not modified by sex, smoking status, use of inhaled corticosteroids, atopy, season of examination or body mass index. Both pollutants were associated with each of the three main domains of control. Conclusions The results suggest that long-term exposure to PM(10) and O(3) is associated with uncontrolled asthma in adults, defined by symptoms, exacerbations and lung function."

Exposure was assessed by linking air pollution values from the Aerometric Information Retrieval System with the patients' home zip code. After adjusting for confounders, a 10 microg/m(3) rise in particulate matter (both with a median aerodynamic diameter of 10 microm (PM(10)) or less and with an aerodynamic diameter of 2.5 microm or less (PM(2.5)) was associated with an 8% (95% confidence interval [CI], 2-15%) and 21% (95% CI, 7-33%) increase in the odds of two or more exacerbations, respectively; a 10-ppb rise in ozone was associated with a 10% (95% CI, 3-17%) increase in odds of two or more exacerbations. For every increase in PM(2.5) of 10 microg/m(3), there was an associated fall in FEV(1) of 24 ml (7-40) (95% CI) after adjusting for confounders. PM(2.5)'s association with mortality did not achieve statistical significance (adjusted RR = 1.32 per 10 microg/m(3) 0.91-1.93; 95% CI).

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has concluded that children with asthma continue to be susceptible to ozone-associated adverse effects on their disease. OBJECTIVES: This study was designed to evaluate time trends in associations between declining warm-season O(3) concentrations and hospitalization for asthma in children. METHODS: We undertook an ecologic study of hospital discharges for asthma during the high O(3) seasons in California's South Coast Air Basin (SoCAB) in children who ranged in age from birth to 19 years from 1983 to 2000. We used standard association and causal statistical analysis methods. Hospital discharge data were obtained from the State of California; air pollution data were obtained from the California Air Resources Board, and demographic data from the 1980, 1990, and 2000 U.S. Census. SoCAB was divided into 195 spatial grids, and quarterly average O(3), sulfurdioxide, particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter < or = 10 microm, nitrogen dioxide, and carbon monoxide were assigned to each unit for 3-month periods along with demographic variables. RESULTS: O(3) was the only pollutant associated with increased hospital admissions over the study period. Inclusion of a variety of demographic and weather variables accounted for all of the non-O(3) temporal changes in hospitalizations. We found a time-independent, constant effect of ambient levels of O(3) and quarterly hospital discharge rates for asthma. We estimate that the average effect of a 10-ppb mean increase in any given mean quarterly 1-hr maximum O(3) over the 18-year median of 87.7 ppb was a 4.6% increase in the same quarterly outcome. CONCLUSIONS: Our data indicate that at current levels of O(3) experienced in Southern California, O(3) contributes to an increased risk of hospitalization for children with asthma."

The authors tested the hypotheses that subchronic and chronic exposure to fine particulate matter (particulate matter < or = 2.5 microm in aerodynamic diameter (PM2.5)), nitrogen dioxide, carbon monoxide, and ozone increases risk of severe infant bronchiolitis requiring hospitalization. Study subjects were derived from linked birth-hospital-discharge records of infants born in 1995-2000 in the South Coast Air Basin of California. Cases with a hospital discharge for bronchiolitis in infancy were matched to 10 age- and gestational-age-matched controls. Exposures in the month prior to hospitalization (subchronic) and mean lifetime exposure (chronic) referenced to the case diagnosis date were assessed on the basis of data derived from the California Air Resources Board. In conditional logistic regression, only subchronic and chronic PM2.5 exposures were associated with increased risk of bronchiolitis hospitalization after adjustment for confounders (per 10-microg/m3 increase, adjusted odds ratio = 1.09 (95% confidence interval: 1.04, 1.14) for both). Ozone was associated with reduced risk in the single-pollutant model, but this relation did not persist in multipollutant models including PM2.5.

Using California Health Interview Survey (CHIS) data, we examined associations between asthma morbidity and air pollution in this region. 

Methods: Eligible subjects were SJV residents (CHIS 2001) who reported physician-diagnosed asthma (n=1,502, 14.6%). We considered two outcomes indicative of uncontrolled asthma: (1) daily or weekly asthma symptoms, and (2) asthma-related ED visits or hospitalization in the past year. Based on residential zip code, subjects were assigned annual average concentrations of ozone, PM10 and PM2.5 for the one-year period prior to the interview date from their closest government air monitoring station within a 5-mile radius. 

Results: Adjusting for age, gender, race/ethnicity, poverty level, and insurance status, we observed increased odds of experiencing daily or weekly asthma symptoms for ozone, PM10 and PM2.5 (ORozone: 1.23, 95% CI: 0.94, 1.60 per 10 ppb; ORPM10: 1.29, 95% CI: 1.05, 1.57 per 10 ?g/m3; and ORPM2.5: 1.82; 95% CI: 1.11, 2.98 per 10 ?g/m3) We also observed a 49% increase in asthma-related ED visits or hospitalizations for ozone (OR: 1.49, 95% CI: 1.05, 2.11 per 10 ppb) and a 29% increase in odds for PM10 (OR: 1.29, 95% CI: 0.99, 1.69 per 10 ?g/m3). 

Conclusions: Overall, these findings suggest that asthmatic individuals living in areas of the SJV with high ozone and particulate pollution levels are more likely to have frequent asthma symptoms and asthma-related ED visits and hospitalizations.

OBJECTIVE: This project investigated the impact of chronic exposure to high ozone levels on childhood asthma admissions in New York State. METHODS: We followed a birth cohort born in New York State during 1995-1999 to first asthma admission or until 31 December 2000. We identified births and asthma admissions through the New York State Integrated Child Health Information System and linked these data with ambient ozone data (8-hr maximum) from the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation. We defined chronic ozone exposure using three indicators: mean concentration during the follow-up period, mean concentration during the ozone season, and proportion of follow-up days with ozone levels > 70 ppb. We performed logistic regression analysis to adjust for child's age, sex, birth weight, and gestational age; maternal race/ethnicity, age, education, insurance status, smoking during pregnancy, and poverty level; and geographic region, temperature, and co-pollutants. 

RESULTS: Asthma admissions were significantly associated with increased ozone levels for all chronic exposure indicators (odds ratios, 1.16-1.68), with a positive dose-response relationship. We found stronger associations among younger children, low sociodemographic groups, and New York City residents as effect modifiers. 

CONCLUSION: Chronic exposure to ambient ozone may increase the risk of asthma admissions among children. Younger children and those in low socioeconomic groups have a greater risk of asthma than do other children at the same ozone level."

More refined assessment has been limited by study size and available air quality data.

Methods: Measurements of 5 pollutants (particulate matter [PM10], ozone, nitrogen dioxide [NO2], carbon monoxide [CO], and sulfur dioxide [SO2]) were available for the entire study period (1 January 1993 to 31 August 2000); detailed measurements of particulate matter were available for 25 months. We obtained data on 4 million emergency department visits from 31 hospitals in Atlanta. Visits for asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, upper respiratory infection, and pneumonia were assessed in relation to air pollutants using Poisson generalized estimating equations.

Results: In single-pollutant models examining 3-day moving averages of pollutants (lags 0, 1, and 2): standard deviation increases of ozone, NO2, CO, and PM10 were associated with 1?3% increases in URI visits; a 2 ?g/m3 increase of PM2.5 organic carbon was associated with a 3% increase in pneumonia visits; and standard deviation increases of NO2 and CO were associated with 2?3% increases in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease visits. Positive associations persisted beyond 3 days for several of the outcomes, and over a week for asthma.

Conclusions: The results of this study contribute to the evidence of an association of several correlated gaseous and particulate pollutants, including ozone, NO2, CO, PM, and organic carbon, with specific respiratory conditions."

Alterations in glutathione metabolism are a central feature of several chronic lung diseases. OBJECTIVES: To determine whether sequence variation in genes in the glutathione synthesis pathway alters susceptibility to air pollution effects on lung function. METHODS: In this prospective study, 14,821 lung function measurements were taken on 2,106 children from 12 Southern California cities. Tagging single-nucleotide polymorphisms in glutathione metabolism pathway genes GSS, GSR, GCLM, and GCLC were genotyped by GoldenGate assay (Illumina, San Diego, CA). Mixed regression models were used to determine whether particular haplotypes were associated with FEV(1), maximal mid-expiratory flow rate, and FVC and whether any of the genetic associations varied with levels of exposure to air pollutants. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: We found that variation in the GSS locus was associated with differences in susceptibility of children for lung function growth deficits associated with NO(2), PM(10), PM(2.5), elemental carbon, organic carbon, and O(3). The negative effects of air pollutants were largely observed within participants who had a particular GSS haplotype. The effects ranged from -124.2 to -149.1 for FEV(1), from -92.9 to -126.7 for FVC, and from -193.9 to -277.9 for maximal mid-expiratory flow rate for all pollutants except O(3), which showed a larger decrease in lung function in children without this haplotype.

Chronic exposure has been associated with decreased lung function in children and adolescents. This study investigated the effects of long-term exposure to O3 on lung function in college freshmen.

Methods: We recruited University of California, Berkeley students (n = 255) who were lifelong residents of the Los Angeles and San Francisco Bay areas and who never smoked. Lifetime exposures to O3, small particulate matter (PM10), and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) were based on spatial interpolation of compliance monitor measurements to all residences at which students lived. Spirometry was performed between February and May, times when students would not have had recent exposure to increased levels of O3.

Results: Lifetime exposure to O3 was associated with decreased levels of measures of small airways (<2 mm) function (FEF75 and FEF25?75). There was an interaction with the FEF25?75/FVC ratio, a measure of intrinsic airway size. Subjects with a large ratio were less likely to have decreases in FEF75 and FEF25?75 for a given estimated lifetime exposure to O3. This association was not altered by history of chronic respiratory disease, allergy, second-hand exposure to environmental tobacco smoke, exposure to PM10 and NO2, or measurement errors in exposure assessment.

Conclusions: A history of increased level of lifetime exposure to ambient O3 is associated with decreased function of airways in which O3 deposition in the lungs is the greatest. Adolescents with intrinsically smaller airways appear to be at greatest risk. Any environmental or genetic factors that lead to reduced airway size may lead to increased susceptibility to the adverse effects of ambient ozone."

The authors studied 72 sophomore cadets from the U.S. Military Academy at West Point, New York, 21 of whom attended special summer training in Fort Dix, New Jersey, an area characterized by elevated ozone levels; the remaining cadets attended training in areas with moderate ozone levels (i.e., Fort Benning, Georgia; Fort Leonard Wood, Missouri; and Fort Sill, Oklahoma). The authors hypothesized that adverse respiratory outcomes, if any, would be more pronounced in the group exposed to higher ozone levels. Spirometry was performed and respiratory symptoms were assessed-both before and after the summer-in a clinic at West Point. lime spent outdoors during summer training averaged 11 hr/d. Both mean and peak ozone levels were higher at Fort Dix than at the three remaining sites. Regional levels of sulfur dioxide and particulate matter less than 10 ""mu""m in aerodynamic diameter were relatively low during the study. However, all cadets reported frequent exposure to dust, exhaust, and smoke in the course of their training. Averaged across all subjects, there was a statistically significant drop in forced expiratory volume in 1 sec of 44 ml (p = .035) over the summer. There were also significant increases in reports of cough, chest tightness, and sore throat at the follow-up clinic visit. A larger mean forced expiratory volume in 1 sec decline was observed at Fort Dix, where ozone exposures were the highest. The results of this study demonstrated a seasonal decline in respiratory function among healthy young adults working outdoors in the presence of ozone and particulate matter."

Spirometric parameters were assessed twice a year, and differences between consecutive measurements divided by days were considered as a measure of lung growth. Exposure was analysed in four classes, separately for winter and summer (semi-annual mean O3 concentrations 22-30, 30-38, 38-46, 46-54 parts per billion (ppb) in summer and 4-12, 12-20, 20-28, 28-36 ppb in winter). Regression methods for repeated measurements were used, and these revealed a significantly lower FVC (FEV1) increase estimated at -19.2 (-18.5) mL x 100 days(-1) for semi-annual mean O3 exposure in summer between 46 and 54 ppb compared to exposure between 22 and 30 ppb. However, in winter, the estimated difference in FVC (FEV1) was 16.4 (10.9) mL x 100 days(-1) between the semi-annual O3 class 28-36 ppb and the 4-12 ppb class. By means of linear regression the study found that there was no association between growth rates and mean summer O3 for FVC and FEV1 over a 3.5 yr period. The authors conclude that medium-term effects on schoolchildren's lung growth are possibly present, but are in the long-term not detectable for forced vital capacity and forced expiratory volume in one second over a 3.5 yr period due to partial reversibility."

Results: Second-trimester exposure to NO2 negatively affected forced vital capacity (FVC) and forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1), and first trimester exposure to PM10 negatively affected peak expiratory flow (PEF) rate. Exposure to CO in early years of life also had a negative effect on FEV1/FVC and forced expiratory flow between 25% and 75% of FVC (FEF25-75)/FVC. Second trimester exposure to PM10 and exposure to CO in the first 6 years of life had negative effects on forced expiratory flow at 25% of FVC. Prenatal, but not trimester-specific, exposure to CO was negatively associated with FEF25-75. Effects were limited to subgroups, such as children who were African American, those diagnosed with asthma before the age of 2 years, and those exposed to maternal smoking during pregnancy. Conclusion: Prenatal and early-life exposures to CO, PM10, and NO2 have a negative effect on pulmonary function in subgroups of asthmatic children."

Little research has been done on the effects of prenatal exposure or the effect among asthmatics. The association between prenatal and early-life exposures and outdoor air pollutants with allergic sensitization was examined within a cohort of 170 children ages 6-11 years with asthma, living in the Central Valley of California. Allergic sensitization was ascertained by skin-prick tests to 14 allergens. Prenatal and early-life exposure to ozone (O3), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), carbon monoxide (CO) and particulate matter with a median aerodynamic diameter < 10 ? m (PM10) was reconstructed for each child. Models were developed for sensitized to (a) any allergen, (b) at least one outdoor allergen, and (c) at least one indoor allergen. In multivariable analyses, higher exposure to CO during pregnancy was associated with an increased risk of sensitization to at least one outdoor allergen. The largest effect was seen for the association between exposure to 8-hour daily maximum CO during pregnancy and sensitization to at least one outdoor allergen. (OR = 1.55 (95% CI: 1.01, 2.37)) per interquartile range (IQR) increase.) Similar effects estimates were seen for 2nd trimester exposure to CO, but these were less precisely estimated (OR = 1.45 (95%CI: 0.90, 2.35)). No significant associations with the pollutants were seen for sensitization to allergens in general or to at least one indoor allergen. Exposure to traffic-related pollutants during pregnancy may increase the risk of sensitization to outdoor allergens among asthmatic children."

The current authors aimed to determine whether pre-natal exposure to air pollution is associated with lung function changes in the newborn. 

In a prospective birth cohort of 241 healthy term-born neonates, tidal breathing, lung volume, ventilation inhomogeneity and exhaled nitric oxide (eNO) were measured during unsedated sleep at age 5 weeks. Maternal exposure to particles with a 50% cut-off aerodynamic diameter of 10 ?m (PM10), nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and ozone (O3), and distance to major roads were estimated during pregnancy. The association between these exposures and lung function was assessed using linear regression. 

Minute ventilation was higher in infants with higher pre-natal PM10 exposure (24.9 mL?min?1 per ?g?m?3 PM10). The eNO was increased in infants with higher pre-natal NO2 exposure (0.98 ppb per ?g?m?3 NO2). Post-natal exposure to air pollution did not modify these findings. No association was found for pre-natal exposure to O3 and lung function parameters. 

The present results suggest that pre-natal exposure to air pollution might be associated with higher respiratory need and airway inflammation in newborns. Such alterations during early lung development may be important regarding long-term respiratory morbidity. "

However, an additional adjustment for the study center eliminated the PM10 association.

The aim of this study was to measure the association between chronic exposure to outdoor air pollutants and adult lung function.

Methods: The relationship between measures of lung function (forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1) and FEV1 as a percentage of forced vital capacity (FVC)) and average exposure to particulate matter ,10 mm in diameter, nitrogen dioxide, sulfur dioxide and ozone was examined in four representative cross-sectional surveys of the English population aged >16 in 1995, 1996, 1997 and 2001. Year-specific estimates were pooled using fixed effects meta-analysis.

Results: Greater exposure to particulate matter ,10 mm in diameter, nitrogen dioxide and sulfur dioxide was associated with lower adult FEV1. The size of the effect on population mean FEV1 was about 3% for particulate matter ,10 mm, and 0.7% for nitrogen dioxide and sulfur dioxide, for a 10 mg/m3 increase in pollutant concentration. The effects were most marked in men, older adults and ex-smokers. FEV1 was not associated with ozone concentration. No associations were found between the pollutants and FEV1 as a percentage of FVC.

Objectives: To evaluate the association between long-term exposure to ozone (O3), particulate matter less than 10 Am in diameter (PM10), and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and lung function growth in Mexico City schoolchildren. 
Methods: A dynamic cohort of 3,170 children aged 8 years at baseline was followed from April 23, 1996, through May 19, 1999. The children attended 39 randomly selected elementary schools located near 10 air quality monitoring stations and were visited every 6 months. Statistical analyses were performed using general linear mixed models. 
Measurements and Main Results: After adjusting for acute exposure and other potential confounding factors, deficits in FVC and FEV1 growth over the 3-year follow-up period were significantly associated with exposure to O3, PM10, and NO2. In multipollutant models, an interquartile range (IQR) increase in mean O3 concentration (IQR, 11.3 ppb) was associated with an annual deficit in FEV1 of 12 ml in girls and 4 ml in boys, an IQR range (IQR, 36.4 Ag/m3) increase in PM10 with an annual deficit in FEV1 of 11 ml in girls and 15 ml in boys, and an IQR range (IQR, 12.0 ppb) increase in NO2 with an annual deficit in FEV1 of 30 ml in girls and 25 ml in boys.

In the fourth-grade cohort, significant deficits in growth of lung function (FEV1, FVC, maximal midexpiratory flow [MMEF], and FEF75) were associated with exposure to particles with aerodynamic diameter less than 10 Am (PM10), PM2.5, PM10-PM2.5, NO2, and inorganic acid vapor (p < 0.05). No significant associations were observed with ozone. The estimated growth rate for children in the most polluted of the communities as compared with the least polluted was predicted to result in a cumulative reduction of 3.4% in FEV1 and 5.0% in MMEF over the 4-yr study period. The estimated deficits were generally larger for children spending more time outdoors. In the seventh- and tenth-grade cohorts, the estimated pollutant effects were also negative for most lung function measures, but sample sizes were lower in these groups and none achieved statistical significance. The results suggest that significant negative effects on lung function growth in children occur at current ambient concentrations of particles, NO2, and inorganic acid vapor."

Infant monkeys were exposed by inhalation to (1) filtered air and saline, (2) house dust mite allergen (HDMA)+ozone and saline, (3) filtered air and ICS (budesonide) or (4) HDMA+ozone and ICS. Allergen/ozone exposures started at 1 month and ICS at 3 months of age. At 6 months of age, methacholine-induced changes in luminal area of airways in proximal and distal lung slices were determined using videomicrometry, followed by histology of the same slices. Proximal airway responsiveness was increased by allergen/ozone and by ICS. Eosinophil profiles were increased by allergen/ozone in both proximal and distal airways, an effect that was decreased by ICS in distal airways. In both allergen/ozone- and air-exposed monkeys, ICS increased the number of alveolar attachments in distal airways, decreased mucin in proximal airways and decreased epithelial volume in both airways. ICS increased smooth muscle in air-exposed animals while decreasing it in allergen/ozone-exposed animals in both airways. In proximal airways, there was a small but significant positive correlation between smooth muscle and airway responsiveness, as well as between alveolar attachments and responsiveness. ICS change morphology and function in normal airways as well as allergen/ozone-exposed airways, suggesting that they should be reserved for infants with active symptoms."

Blocks of tissue selected throughout the lung and from first generation RBs following airway microdissection had the following significant exposure-related changes: 57% greater volume of RB in the lung, 27% smaller diameter of RB lumen, 179% thicker media and intima of peribronchiolar arterioles, 61% thicker RB epithelium, and 77% thicker PCT. The increase in thickness of the RB wall resulted primarily from an 84% increase in PCT, with the remainder from the epithelium. Estimates of cellular numerical density showed an 81% increase in cuboidal bronchiolar cells and an 87% decrease in type 1 pneumocytes in the exposed group. Cell volumes from serial section reconstruction showed significantly larger cuboidal bronchiolar (79%), ciliated (117%), and type 2 (66%) cells over controls. Significant PCT changes included more amorphous extracellular matrix (288%), neutrophils (1523%), and lymphocytes/plasma cells (307%). The number of fibroblasts and the volume of extracellular fibers were larger than control values by 44% and 31% in the exposed group, but these changes were not statistically significant. Centriacinar changes due to exposure to long-term, high ambient ozone in bonnet monkeys results in narrowing of respiratory bronchioles primarily by peribronchiolar inflammation (inflammatory cells, fibers, amorphous matrix) and secondarily through hyperplasia of cuboidal bronchiolar cells."

Risk factors include chronic exposure to allergens and air pollution. While chronically activated mast cells contribute to the pathophysiology of asthma in part through their proteases such as chymase and tryptase, previous studies of airway mast cell abundance and distribution in asthmatics have been inconsistent. To determine whether repeated episodic exposures to environmental pollutants during postnatal lung development alters airway mast cell abundance and distribution, we exposed infant rhesus monkeys to a known human allergen, house dust mite antigen (HDMA) and/or a known environmental pollutant, ozone (O3) and quantitatively compared the abundance of tryptase or chymase positive mast cells in three airway levels. Mast cells are resident in multiple compartments of the airway wall in infant rhesus monkeys raised from birth in filtered air. Tryptase and chymase positive cells were most abundant in trachea and least in terminal bronchioles. The majority of tryptase positive and almost all chymase positive cells were in extracellular matrix and smooth muscle bundles. Chronic exposure to HDMA elevated the abundance of both tryptase and chymase positive cells in the trachea and intrapulmonary bronchi. Neither exposure to O3 nor HDMA+O3 increased mast cell accumulations in the airway wall. We conclude that during postnatal airway development: 1) mast cells are a resident airway cell population even in the absence of toxic air contaminants; 2) aeroallergen exposure alters large airway mast cell distribution and abundance, increasing chymase positive mast cells; 3) this response is attenuated by exposure to oxidant air pollutants."

We examined collagen deposition in lung tissue from these animals to determine whether or not chronic exposure of rats to ozone causes pulmonary fibrosis, as defined biochemically. Several techniques were used to study collagen deposition in the lungs of the animals. These methods included biochemical quantification by analysis of 4-hydroxyproline in lung tissue hydrolysates. The hydroxylysine-derived cross-links in mature collagen were quantified to estimate biochemically the excess of fibrotic collagen in the lung tissue. Biochemical analysis indicated excess collagen in the female rats exposed to 0.5 or 1.0 ppm ozone. Collagen in the lungs of the females also contained relatively more hydroxylysine-derived cross-links than did the lung collagen from age-matched control animals that had breathed only filtered air. Exposure of Fischer-344 rats for 20 months to 0.5 or 1.0 ppm ozone was associated with excess fibrotic lung collagen deposition as defined histologically. In female rats, exposure was also associated with excess deposition as determined biochemically. There was no indication of any significant changes in the lungs of any of the rats exposed to 0.12 ppm ozone, but the number of animals in this group was far too small to conclude whether this was a true no-observable-effect level. We conclude that chronic exposure of rats for 20 months to ozone at concentrations of 0.5 ppm or above for six hours per day, five days per week, causes mild to moderate lung fibrosis, as defined histologically and, in female rats, biochemically. The significance of these observations with regard to health risks to humans chronically inhaling ozone at ambient levels in polluted air remains to be determined."

Significant changes in respiratory bronchioles following exposure included: a thicker wall and a narrower lumen, a thicker epithelial compartment and a much thicker interstitial compartment, shifts in epithelial cell populations with many more nonciliated bronchiolar epithelial cells and fewer squamous type I epithelial cells, larger nonciliated bronchiolar epithelial cells with a larger complement of cellular organelles associated with protein synthesis, greater amounts of both interstitial fibers and amorphous ground substance, greater numbers of interstitial smooth muscle cells per epithelial basal lamina surface area, and greater volumes of interstitial smooth muscle, macrophages, mast cells, and neutrophils per epithelial basal lamina surface area.

One group was killed immediately after the exposure period; the second exposed group breathed filtered air for 6 months after the ozone exposure before being killed. Previous studies of these monkeys had revealed that lung collagen content was increased in both exposed groups (J.A. Last et al., (1984). Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol. 72, 111-118). In the present study specific collagen crosslinks were quantified in order to determine whether the excess collagen in the lungs of these animals was structurally normal or abnormal. In the group killed immediately after exposure, the difunctional crosslink dehydrodihydroxylysinonorleucine (DHLNL) was elevated, as was the ratio of DHLNL to dehydrohydroxylysinonorleucine (HLNL). Lung content of the mature nonreducible crosslink hydroxypyridinium was also increased in this group. In the group killed after a 6-month postexposure period, lung content of the difunctional crosslinks DHLNL and HLNL was indistinguishable from control values. However, lung hydroxypyridinium content was significantly increased. The changes in collagen crosslinking observed in the group killed at the termination of exposure are characteristic of those seen in lung tissue in the acute stage of experimental pulmonary fibrosis. The changes seen in the postexposure group suggest that while the lung collagen being synthesized at the time the animals were killed was apparently normal, ""abnormal"" collagen synthesized during the period of ozone exposure was irreversibly deposited in the lungs. This study suggests that long-term exposure to relatively low levels of ozone may cause irreversible changes in lung collagen structure."

Sixweek-old Fisher 344 rats were exposed to O3 in two different subchronic low-level exposure patterns. The first was a 12 hr/day exposure for 6 weeks and included two O3 concentrations, 0.12 and 0.25 ppm. The second consisted of an exposure profile having a background level of 0.06 ppm with a 9-hr period. Rats given the second exposure pattern were exposed for either 3 or 13 weeks. Changes in the volumes of alveolar epithelium were found to be consistent and reproducible markers for cell injury and/or response. Results from the first study indicated that the relative volume of the type I epithelium increased 13 and 23% over the control value (p < 0.05) following exposures for 6 weeks to 0.12 and 0.25 ppm, respectively. The magnitude of the increases were clearly concentration related. Similarly, when a fixed exposure concentration was employed the relative volume of type I epithelium was found to increase in proportion to the exposure time. In the second exposure, increases of 9 and 33% in relative volume of type I epithelium were found respectively after 3 and 13 weeks of exposure. If the total exposure determined by the product of O3 concentration (including background) and exposure time is plotted against the relative volume of type I epithelium from both the 0.12 ppm (60.5 ppm-hr) and 0.25 ppm (126 ppm-hr) exposures and the 3-week (45.3 ppm-hrs) and 13-week (196.2 ppm-hr) exposures, a linear relationship between increases in type I cell volume and the concentration ? time product is observed. The coefficient of correlation (r2) for the linear regression of the animal means is 0.72. Changes in the volume of Type II epithelial cell also correlate with the concentration ? time product (r2 = 0.66). This suggests that epithelial cell reactions to low-level subchronic exposure of O3 are directly related to the cumulative oxidant concentration. The pattern of exposure did not appear to affect the resulting degree of injury. Furthermore, a low level of background exposure may contribute to the epithelial cell injuries."

Issues the design of that study could not address were (1) the status of cellular differentiation at earlier time points during the course of ozone exposure; (2) whether changes that appeared to be compensatory after 20 months of exposure were due to ozone, or were aspects of the natural aging process in rats; (3) the inability to define adequately which effects were related specifically to the prolonged duration of exposure; and (4) how and what changes brought about by the natural aging process may have overridden or confounded a clear definition of the effects of exposure to ozone at ambient concentrations (e.g., 0.12 parts per million [ppm]), which are of most concern with long-term exposure to this pollutant. The present study examined the effects of a 3-month exposure to ozone under conditions identical to those of the 20-month NTP/HEI Collaborative Ozone Project. In our facilities at the University of California, Davis, we exposed 42 male F344/N rats to either filtered air or 0.12 or 1.0 ppm ozone. After 3 months of exposure to 1.0 ppm ozone, changes in the distribution of superoxide dismutase (SOD) in the copper-zinc (Cu-Zn) form were shown by a pattern of reduced staining in terminal bronchioles and the centriacinar region; and the manganese (Mn) form of SOD was elevated within the centriacinar region. Further analysis by transmission electron microscopy and immunogold labeling confirmed that Mn SOD was elevated within epithelial type II cells immediately distal to the bronchiole-alveolar duct, junction (BADJ). The trachea, three major bronchi, and a short-length and long-length airway path relative to the trachea were examined by morphometric techniques. The pulmonary acini arising from each of these two paths were also examined morphometrically as a function of distance into the alveolar duct. Cellular changes occurring in each of these anatomical regions after 3 months of exposure were analyzed and compared to the changes noted after the 20-month ozone exposures. We found significant increases in the volume density of nonciliated epithelial cells lining the trachea and caudal bronchi as well as in the proximal and terminal bronchioles of the cranial region at a concentration of 1.0 ppm ozone after both 3 and 20 months of exposure. Remodeling of the centriacinar region, particularly within the cranial region of the lungs after exposure to 1.0 ppm ozone, was statistically significant at both 3 and 20 months. No statistically significant effects were noted following exposure to 0.12 ppm ozone for either 3 or 20 months. An important finding was that age did not influence the effect of ozone on the lungs of rats. We conclude that long-term exposure to ozone, rather than the effects of aging, lead to significant alterations of epithelial cell populations lining the airways and centriacinar region of the lung. Marked cellular changes were noted after exposure to 1.0 ppm ozone, but not to 0.12 ppm."

The principal objective of the present study was to morphometrically assess the severity of the ozone-induced changes in the bony tissue of the maxilloturbinates in these chronically exposed rats. Male and female F344/N rats were exposed to 0, 0.12, 0.5, or 1.0 part per million (ppm) ozone, 6 hours/day, 5 days/week for 20 or 24 months. Rats were killed one week after the end of the exposure, and nasal tissues were processed for light and electron microscopy. Using image analysis and standard morphometric techniques, the amounts of bone, surface epithelium, and lamina propria comprising the maxilloturbinates were estimated by measuring the cross-sectional area of each tissue compartment at a defined location in the proximal nasal passage. Both male and female rats had significant morphologic and morphometric changes in the maxilloturbinates after prolonged exposures to 0.5 or 1.0 ppm ozone, but not to 0.12 ppm ozone. Ozone-exposed rats had significant reductions in the cross-sectional area of turbinate bone, reflecting the loss of bone in the maxilloturbinate after prolonged exposure. This ozone-induced bony atrophy was more severe in  male  than in female rats. Using electron microscopy, numerous bone-resorption sites were identified on the outer, periosteal, surface of the turbinate bone in ozone-exposed animals. Rats with bony atrophy also had a conspicuous influx and mixed inflammatory cells into the lamina propria surrounding the turbinate bone. In addition, ozone exposures caused reductions in the area of lamina propria, due to blood vessel constriction, and increases the in the area of the surface epithelium, due to hyperplasia and metaplasia. The results of the present study demonstrated that prolonged exposure of rats to ozone can cause marked loss of turbinate bone. The severity of this ozone-induced bony atrophy in rats is dependent on both concentration and gender."

Rats were killed 1 wk after the end of the exposure, and nasal tissues were processed  for  light and electron microscopy. Standard morphometric techniques were used to determine epithelial cell densities and the amounts of IM in the surface epithelium lining the nasal airways. No mucous cells or IM were present in the epithelia lining the nasal lateral meatus and maxillary sinus of rats exposed to 0 or 0.12 ppm ozone. In contrast, rats exposed to 0.5 or 1.0 ppm ozone had marked mucous cell metaplasia (MCM) with numerous mucous cells and conspicuous amounts of IM in the surface epithelium lining these upper airways. Ozone-induced increases in total epithelial cells (i.e., epithelial hyperplasia) were present only in rats exposed to 1.0 ppm. The results of this study indicate that rats chronically exposed to 1.0 or 0.5 ppm, but not 0.12 ppm, ozone can develop marked MCM with significant increases in IM in both proximal and distal nasal airways. The epithelial changes observed throughout the nasal passages of ozone-exposed rats may be adaptive responses in an attempt to protect the upper and lower respiratory tract from further ozone-induced injury."

Part VIII: Morphometric analysis of structural alterations in alveolar regions,"Chang, LY; Stockstill, BL; Menache, MG; Mercer, RR; Crapo, JD",1995.0,"Morphometric techniques were used to examine cellular and tissue changes occurring in male and female rat lungs exposed to ozone for a prolonged time. F344/N rats were exposed to 0.0, 0.12, 0.5, or 1.0 parts per million (ppm)* ozone for six hours per day, five days per week, for 20 months. Changes in cell volume, cell surface ratios, and cellular characteristics were studied in the terminal bronchioles and in the proximal alveolar regions of the lungs. Animals exposed for 20 months to 0.5 or 1.0 ppm ozone demonstrated dramatic increases in the volume of interstitium and epithelium along the alveolar ducts. The thickening of the epithelium was caused by an epithelial metaplasia in which the normal squamous epithelium was modified to a cuboidal epithelium similar, but not identical, to the type found in terminal bronchioles. This bronchiolar epithelial metaplasia was directly related to dose of ozone, and was characterized by differentiated ciliated cells and Clara cells similar to those found in terminal bronchioles; undifferentiated cuboidal cells also were found in the animals exposed to 0.5 and 1.0 ppm ozone. A mild fibrotic response was seen in the animals exposed to 1.0 ppm ozone, with increases in both the interstitial matrix and cellular interstitium. The individual components of the interstitial matrix, including collagen, elastin, basement membrane, and acellular spaces, all were increased. The increase in cellular interstitium was due to an increase in the volume of interstitial fibroblasts. A slight inflammatory response, identified by an increase in alveolar macrophages, was observed in the animals exposed to 1.0 ppm. The terminal bronchioles were less affected than the proximal alveolar region by the ozone exposures, which may indicate a resistance of this tissue to ozone damage. The changes in the terminal bronchioles mainly consisted of a shift in cell type from ciliated to Clara cells in the animals exposed to 1.0 ppm ozone. The bronchiolar epithelial metaplasia observed in the proximal alveolar ducts may indicate that a protective mechanism develops in response to prolonged exposure to high concentrations of ozone."

Male and female Fischer 344 rats were exposed and morphometric methods were used to determine the volume, surface area, and cellular changes observed in bronchiole-alveolar duct regions following chronic ozone exposure. No major gender-related effects were observed in response to chronic inhalation of ozone nor were significant effects of ozone exposure found in either terminal bronchioles or the proximal alveolar regions in animals chronically exposed to 0.12 ppm ozone. The proximal alveolar regions of animals exposed for 20 months to 0.5 and 1.0 ppm ozone were significantly altered with exposure. The high-dose, long-term exposure to ozone resulted in a pronounced increase in volume of both the interstitium and epithelium in the proximal alveolar regions. The thickening of the epithelium was due to a change in tissue type from the normal squamous epithelium to a cuboidal epithelium similar, but not identical, to that found in terminal bronchioles. This bronchiolar epithelial metaplasia of proximal alveolar ducts, which was dose related, was composed of differentiated ciliated and Clara cells similar to those found in terminal bronchioles. In addition, unique cells which contained morphologic features of many different cell types were observed. These cells, which may represent stem cells or differentiated but transformed cells, were found associated with the bronchiolar metaplasia of alveolar ducts. In conjunction with the epithelial changes, cellular and matrix components in the interstitium were increased with chronic exposure to 0.5 and 1.0 ppm ozone. All matrix components were increased including collagen, elastin, and basement membrane, as well as other acellular spaces which did not contain identifiable structures. The total volume of interstitial fibroblasts was also increased in the high-dose exposure group. Alveolar macrophages were increased only in the 1.0 ppm exposed animals. The cell and tissue changes in the terminal bronchioles were less pronounced indicating a relative resistance of this tissue to ozone and mainly consisted of a change in cell type from ciliated to Clara cells in the 1.0 ppm exposed animals. The relative resistance of bronchiolar tissue to high concentration ozone exposure and the extensive bronchiolar epithelial metaplasia seen in the alveolar ducts suggest that bronchiolar metaplasia may be an adaptive mechanism following chronic ozone exposure. The bronchiolar epithelial metaplasia and interstitial fibrosis seen with high-dose chronic ozone exposure are similar to, and may be a model for, the early steps in human fibrotic diseases such as idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis."

The purpose of this study was to establish whether the development of tolerance to long-term exposure is associated with changes in the tracheobronchial epithelium. Male F344-N rats were exposed to 0, 0.12, 0.5, or 1.0 ppm ozone 6 hours/day for 5 days/week for 20 months and killed 1 week post-exposure. Samples for light microscopic morphometry were obtained by microdissection from each infusion-fixed trachea and left lung lobe and included: 1) a cranial bronchus with short path length (generation no. 4 to 5) and small diameter; 2) a central bronchus with short path length (generation no. 4 to 5) and large diameter; and 3) a caudal bronchus with long path length (generation no. 10 to 12) and small diameter. In addition, three sites within the central acinus were examined from cranial, central, and caudal regions. These sites included terminal bronchiole, 0.5 to 1 mm proximal to terminal bronchiole and bronchiolarized alveolar duct. Intraepithelial mucin storage (AB/PAS-positive material quantified by image analysis) within the trachea decreased with dose. Mucin storage was unchanged in the central bronchus, increased threefold with dose in the caudal bronchus, and was six times higher in the cranial bronchus at 1.0 ppm ozone. Epithelial composition was unchanged in trachea or any bronchi; however, we noted a significant dose-dependent increase in nonciliated cell mass and volume fraction in terminal bronchioles in all three regions. There was also a significant increase in nonciliated cell mass in the bronchiolarized alveolar ducts. Bronchiolar nonciliated cells were identified greater than fourfold further into alveolar ducts in 1.0 ppm exposed than in 0 ppm animals. Nonciliated cells occurred almost 200 microns deeper into alveolar ducts in cranial regions than in caudal regions. We conclude: 1) that the development of tolerance to injury produced by long-term exposure to ozone involves changes in airway epithelium and 2) that these changes are site specific and involve alterations in both secretory activity and cellular composition."

The incidence of alveolar/bronchiolar adenomas and carcinomas (combined) increased (p lt 0.05) in female mice exposed to1.0 ppm for 24 or 30 mo and marginally increased (p gt 0.05) in male mice exposed to concentrations of 0.5 or 1.0 ppm. An increased incidence of nonneoplastic lesions were observed in the nasal cavities and in the centriacinar region of the lung of mice exposed to 0.5 or 1.0 ppm for 24 and 30 mo. Nasal cavity lesions were mild and included hyaline degeneration, hyperplasia, squamous metaplasia, fibrosis and suppurative inflammation of the transitional and respiratory epithelium of the lateral wall, and atrophy of the olfactory epithelium. Lung lesions included replacement of the epithelium of the alveolar ducts and adjacent alveolar septa with epithelium similar to that normally found in terminal bronchioles (metaplasia) and associated alveolar histiocytosis. Based on the results of these studies, we conclude that inhalation exposure of B6C3F1 mice to ozone for 24 or 30 mo (a) is carcinogenic in female B6C3F1 mice exposed to 1.0 ppm of ozone based on an increased incidence of alveolar/bronchiolar adenoma or carcinoma and (b) results in mild, site-specific, nonneoplastic lesions in the nasal cavity and centriacinar lung of male and female mice exposed to 0.5 or 1.0 ppm of ozone for 2 yrs, which persist with continued exposure to 30 mo.

Since the area of the junction of the conductive and respiratory regions of the lung has been reported as the major site of injury due to O3 inhalation, techniques were devised to specifically study alveolar tissue from this region. One-day-old or 6-week-old male rats were exposed to either 0.25 ppm O3 12 hours/day or to continuous room air for 6 weeks. An additional group of 6-week-old rats were exposed to 0.12 ppm O3 for the same time period. All lungs were fixed at the end of the exposure by intratracheal installation of buffered 2% glutaraldehyde. Cylinders of tissue containing a cross-section of a terminal bronchiole were punched out of lung tissue slices using a sharpened cannula. These tissue cylinders were oriented, embedded in Epon, serial sectioned until the first alveolar duct bifurcation was reached, and then thin sectioned for electron microscopy. Qualitative examination of the tissue revealed little observable damage to the proximal alveolar tissues. However, by ultrastructure morphometric analysis, significant changes occurred in the alveolar epithelium of the proximal alveolar region of all exposed animals. In the animals exposed to 0.25 ppm O3 from 1 day of age (juvenile animals), the number of type 1 epithelial cells doubled, their mean surface area decreased 38%, and their mean thickness increased 24%. The number of alveolar type 2 epithelial cells increased, and the number of alveolar macrophages doubled. Adult animals exposed to 0.25 ppm O3 showed similar patterns of changes in the epithelium of the proximal alveolar region and in addition had a doubling of interstitial macrophages, indicating a mild inflammatory stimulus in the interstitium. Adult animals exposed to 0.12 ppm O3 showed smaller, but statistically significant changes in the alveolar type 1 epithelium, suggesting a relatively linear concentration-response relationship. The change in number and size of type 1 cells in all exposed animals is consistent with an increased cell turnover rate due to prolonged O3 inhalation. These results suggest that low concentrations of O3 cause a chronic epithelial injury in the proximal alveolar region and that the extent of these changes occurs in a concentration-dependent manner, even at concentrations as low as 0.12 ppm. No statistically significant age-dependent effects were found."

However, it is unknown whether this process is reversible, so that limiting pollution will benefit these children. We measured the short-term response of allergic asthmatic children exposed to a real-life reduction in outdoor air pollution by using noninvasive biomarkers of airway inflammation and function. 

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Thirty-seven untreated allergic children with mild persistent asthma were recruited from a highly polluted urban environment and relocated to a less polluted rural environment. Air pollution, pollen counts, and meteorological conditions were carefully monitored at both sites. Nasal eosinophils, fractional exhaled nitric oxide, peak expiratory flow, and urinary leukotriene E(4) were measured first in the urban environment and then again 7 days after relocation to the rural environment. 

RESULTS: One week after relocation to the rural environment, we measured, on average, a fourfold decrease in nasal eosinophils and significant decrease in fractional exhaled nitric oxide. We also noted an improvement in lower airway function, reflected by highly significant increase in peak expiratory flow. In contrast, mean urinary leukotriene E(4) concentration remained unchanged after 1 week of exposure to the rural environment. 

CONCLUSIONS: Better air quality is associated with a rapid reduction of airway inflammation in allergic asthmatic children. Nasal eosinophils and fractional exhaled nitric oxide are sensitive indicators of this effect, and their rapid decline is paralleled by improved airway function measured by peak expiratory flow. Leukotriene synthesis has a more variable response to environmental modifications."

Determinants of exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) need to be understood better to maximize the value of FeNO measurement in clinical practice and research. Our aim was to identify significant predictors of FeNO in an initial cross-sectional survey of southern California schoolchildren, part of a larger longitudinal study of asthma incidence.
Methods
During one school year, we measured FeNO at 100 ml/sec flow, using a validated offline technique, in 2568 children of age 7?10 yr. We estimated online (50 ml/sec flow) FeNO using a prediction equation from a separate smaller study with adjustment for offline measurement artifacts, and analyzed its relationship to clinical and demographic characteristics.
Results
FeNO was lognormally distributed with geometric means ranging from 11 ppb in children without atopy or asthma to 16 ppb in children with allergic asthma. Although effects of atopy and asthma were highly significant, ranges of FeNO for children with and without those conditions overlapped substantially. FeNO was significantly higher in subjects aged > 9, compared to younger subjects. Asian-American boys showed significantly higher FeNO than children of all other sex/ethnic groups; Hispanics and African-Americans of both sexes averaged slightly higher than non-Hispanic whites. Increasing height-for-age had no significant effect, but increasing weight-for-height was associated with decreasing FeNO.
Conclusion
FeNO measured offline is a useful biomarker for airway inflammation in large population-based studies. Further investigation of age, ethnicity, body-size, and genetic influences is needed, since they may contribute to substantial variation in FeNO."

Only 7.8% of Mexico City children had abnormal lung function tests based on predicted values. These findings are consistent with bronchiolar, peribronchiolar, and/or alveolar duct inflammation, possibly caused by ozone, PM, and lipopolysaccharide exposure. The epidemiologic implications of these findings are important for children residing in polluted environments, because bronchiolar disease could lead to chronic pulmonary disease later in life."

In total, 304 PiZZ subjects underwent full lung function testing and quantitative high-resolution
computed tomography to identify the presence and severity of the disease. Mean annual air
pollutant data for 2006 was matched to the location of patients? houses and used in regression
models to identify phenotypic associations with pollution, controlling for covariates. Relative
trends in pollution levels were assessed to validate use of a single year?s data to indicate longterm
exposure.
Pollutant levels correlated significantly with one another, with higher levels of primary particles,
SO2 and NO2 being associated with lower ozone levels. Regression models showed that
estimated higher exposure to ozone was associated with worse gas transfer and more severe
emphysema. Regression parameters suggested that significance from other pollutants was due to
collinearity with ozone. The 2006 pollutant levels showed linear relationships with cumulative
years, thus validating the model.
Higher exposures to ozone may be associated with worse respiratory status in a1-antitrypsin

The specific factors underlying this differential susceptibility are unknown but may be related to air pollutant-induced nasal alterations during postnatal development that impair the normal physiological functions (e.g., filtration and mucociliary clearance) serving to protect the more distal airways from inhaled xenobiotics. In adult animal models, chronic ozone exposure is associated with adaptations leading to a decrease in airway injury. The purpose of our study was to determine whether cyclic ozone exposure induces persistent morphological and biochemical effects on the developing nasal airways of infant monkeys early in life. Infant (180-day-old) rhesus macaques were exposed to 5 consecutive days of O(3) [0.5 parts per million (ppm), 8 h/day; &quot;1-cycle&quot;] or filtered air (FA) or 11 biweekly cycles of O(3) (FA days 1-9; 0.5 ppm, 8 h/day on days 10-14; &quot;11-cycle&quot;). The left nasal passage was processed for light microscopy and morphometric analysis. Mucosal samples from the right nasal passage were processed for GSH, GSSG, ascorbate (AH(2)), and uric acid (UA) concentration. Eleven-cycle O(3) induced persistent rhinitis, squamous metaplasia, and epithelial hyperplasia in the anterior nasal airways of infant monkeys, resulting in a 39% increase in the numeric density of epithelial cells. Eleven-cycle O(3) also induced a 65% increase in GSH concentrations at this site. The persistence of epithelial hyperplasia was positively correlated with changes in GSH. These results indicate that early life ozone exposure causes persistent nasal epithelial alterations in infant monkeys and provide a potential mechanism for the increased susceptibility to respiratory illness exhibited by children in polluted environments."

Using a metabolomic approach, we investigated inflammatory responses in arachidonic and linoleic acid biochemical cascades (35 metabolites) and the expression of 19 cytokines/chemokines at three time points (2, 6, and 24 hr) following exposure to 1-NN with and without prior long-term O3 exposure. Long-term O3 exposure is associated with biochemical changes that have been shown to render the lung resistant to further O3 exposure. This study indicates that airways of O3-tolerant rats exhibited a low level of chronic inflammation, rendering the lungs more susceptible to other environmental pollutants such as 1-NN. Specifically, a 12.5-mg/kg dose of 1-NN to O3-tolerant rats produced significantly higher levels of cysteinyl-leukotrienes in bronchiolar lavage fluid even when compared to a 50-mg/kg dose of 1-NN in rats exposed to filtered air. Collectively, these results indicate that the combination of exposures as encountered in polluted ambient air are considerably more injurious to the lung than would be anticipated from previous studies employing single exposures. The observed synergism between O3 and 1-NN may be causally related to a shift in a T-helper 1 to T-helper 2 immune response in the airways."

Objective: In this study we examined whether air pollutants are associated with childhood respiratory allergies in the United States. 

Methods: For the approximately 70,000 children from the 1999?2005 National Health Interview Survey eligible for this study, we assigned between 40,000 and 60,000 ambient pollution monitoring data from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, depending on the pollutant. We used monitors within 20 miles of the child?s residential block group. We used logistic regression models, fit with methods for complex surveys, to examine the associations between the reporting of respiratory allergy or hay fever and annual average exposure to particulate matter ? 2.5 ?m in diameter (PM2.5) , PM ? 10 ?m in diameter, sulfur dioxide, and nitrogen dioxide and summer exposure to ozone, controlling for demographic and geographic factors. 

Results: Increased respiratory allergy/hay fever was associated with increased summer O3 levels [adjusted odds ratio (AOR) per 10 ppb = 1.20 ; 95% confidence interval (CI) , 1.15?1.26] and increased PM2.5 (AOR per 10 ?g/m3 = 1.23 ; 95% CI, 1.10?1.38) . These associations persisted after stratification by urban?rural status, inclusion of multiple pollutants, and definition of exposures by differing exposure radii. No associations between the other pollutants and the reporting respiratory allergy/hay fever were apparent. 

Conclusions: These results provide evidence of adverse health for children living in areas with chronic exposure to higher levels of O3 and PM2.5 compared with children with lower exposures."

Recent findings suggest that exposure to outdoor air pollutants may increase the risk of allergic rhinitis. The results of these studies are inconsistent, but warrant further attention. The objective of the study was to assess the effect of relation between exposure to urban air pollution and the prevalence allergic rhinitis among school children.

Methods
We conducted a nationwide cross-sectional study of 32,143 Taiwanese school children. We obtained routine air-pollution monitoring data for sulphur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen oxides (NOx), ozone (O3), carbon monoxide (CO), and particles with an aerodynamic diameter of 10 ?m or less (PM10). A parent-administered questionnaire provided information on individual characteristics and indoor environments (response rate 92%). Municipal-level exposure was calculated using the mean of the 2000 monthly averages. The effect estimates were presented as odds ratios (ORs) per 10 ppb change for SO2, NOx, and O3, 100 ppb change for CO, and 10 ?g/m3 change for PM10.

Results
In two-stage hierarchical model adjusting for confounding, the prevalence of allergic rhinitis was significantly associated with SO2 (adjusted odds ratio (OR) = 1.43, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.25, 1.64), CO (aOR = 1.05, 95% CI: 1.04, 1.07), and NOx (aOR = 1.11, 95% CI: 1.08, 1.15). Contrary to our hypothesis, the prevalence of allergic rhinitis was weakly or not related to O3 (aOR = 1.05, 95% CI: 0.98, 1.12) and PM10 (aOR = 1.00, 95% CI: 0.99, 1.02).

Conclusion
Persistent exposure to NOx, CO, and SO2 may increase the prevalence of allergic rhinitis in children."

OBJECTIVE: Our cross-sectional study was intended to analyse the associations between long-term exposure to background air pollution and atopic and respiratory outcomes in a large population-based sample of schoolchildren. METHODS: Six thousand six hundred and seventy-two children aged 9-11 years recruited from 108 randomly schools in six French cities underwent a clinical examination including a skin prick test (SPT) to common allergens, exercise-induced bronchial reactivity (EIB) and skin examination for flexural dermatitis. The prevalence of asthma, allergic rhinitis (AR) and atopic dermatitis was assessed by a standardized health questionnaire completed by the parents. Three-year-averaged concentrations of air pollutants (NO2, SO2, PM10 and O3) were calculated at children' schools using measurements of background monitoring stations. RESULTS: After adjusting for confounders, EIB, lifetime asthma and lifetime AR were found to be positively related to an increase in the exposure to SO2, PM10 and O3. The adjusted odds ratios (aOR) per increase of 5 microg/m3 of SO2 was 1.39 (95% confidence interval (CI)=1.15-1.66) for EIB and 1.19 (1.00-1.41) for lifetime asthma. The aOR for lifetime AR per increase of 10 microg/m3 of PM10 was 1.32 (CI=1.04-1.68). Moreover, SPT positivity was associated with O3 (aOR=1.34; CI=1.24-1.46). Associations with past year symptoms were consistent, even if not always statistically significant. Results persisted in long-term resident (current address for at least 8 years) children. However, no consistent positive association was found with NO2. CONCLUSIONS: A moderate increase in long-term exposure to background ambient air pollution was associated with an increased prevalence of respiratory and atopic indicators in children.

In the present study, we investigated the concentration-dependency of the effects of exposure to O(3) on the aggravation of nasal allergy-like reactions induced by repeated nasal administration of antigen. Guinea pigs were exposed to filtered air or 0.1-0.6 ppm O(3) for 5 weeks. After each weekly administration of ovalbumin (OVA), sneezes and nasal secretions were measured. The number of eosinophils infiltrating the nasal septum and the titers of OVA-specific antibody were measured 24h after the last administration. Ozone increased sneezing and nasal secretion induced by OVA, nasal responsiveness to physical stimuli, and the number of infiltrating eosinophils in a concentration-dependent manner. The titer of anti-OVA-IgG was increased in animals exposed to 0.6 ppm O(3). Thus, exposure to O(3) aggravated nasal allergy-like symptoms concentration dependently. The aggravation was caused by induction of nasal hyperresponsiveness, the infiltration of eosinophils, and the increase in the production of anti-OVA-IgG. The estimated maximum likelihood estimation concentrations (MLECs) and bench mark concentrations (BMCs) of O(3) for these indices were in the range of 0.09-0.18 and 0.02-0.06 ppm, respectively."

The pulmonary response was evaluated by means of pulmonary function testing, light microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, transmission microscopy, autoradiography, and morphometry. Pulmonary function values obtained before exposure did not statistically differ from values obtained after exposure. A general trend of increased quasistatic compliance of the lung was observed in both groups of exposed monkeys. Morphologic changes were principally characterized as low-grade chronic respiratory bronchiolitis. Major features were intraluminal accumulations of macrophages and hypertrophy and hyperplasia of cuboidal bronchiolar epithelial cells. The intensity of this inflammatory response was determined by counting the number of intraluminal inflammatory cells per millimeter of respiratory bronchiolar surface. The magnitude of inflammation was greatest at the 0.8 ppm ozone concentration at each exposure period; however, the number of inflammatory cells present at 90 days was less than one half that observed at 7 days, in spite of persistent ozone insult. Tritiated thymidine labeling and counts of respiratory bronchiolar epithelium demonstrated up to a 37-fold increase in labeling index at 7 days but only a sevenfold increase at 90 days. Differential cell counts demonstrated an increase in the proportion of cuboidal bronchiolar cells constituting the respiratory bronchiolar epithelium. In control monkeys, 60% of the epithelial cells were cuboidal bronchiolar cells. At 90 days of exposure, more than 90% of the respiratory bronchiolar cells were cuboidal in appearance. The cuboidal bronchiolar cell in control monkeys does not appear secretory, but membrane-bound electron-dense secretory granules are present in this cell type from exposed monkeys. Epithelial hyperplasia (increased number of cells per millimeter of airway length) persisted through 90 days of exposure at a level slightly above that present at 7 days."

The aim was to examine the relationship between air pollution concentrations and total IgE levels in adult asthmatics. METHODS: The present study relates to the 369 asthmatic adults from the French Epidemiological study on Genetics and Environment of Asthma (EGEA), with availability of data on both total serum IgE measurements and air pollution concentrations. Geo-statistical models were performed on 4 x 4 km grids to assess individual outdoor air pollution exposure. Annual outdoor concentrations of ozone (O(3)), nitrogen dioxide (NO(2)), sulphur dioxide (SO(2)), and particulate matter smaller than 10 microm size (PM(10)), and concentrations of summer ozone were assigned to subject's home address. RESULTS: The geometric mean of total IgE was 161 IU/ml and the average of O(3) exposure was 44.9 +/- 9.5 microg/m(3). Ozone concentrations were positively related to total IgE levels and an increase of 10 microg/m(3) of O(3) resulted in an increase of 20.4% (95% CI = 3.0-40.7) in total IgE levels. Adjustment for age, gender, smoking habits and previous life in the countryside did not change the results, and an increase of 19.1% (2.4-38.6) in total IgE was observed with O(3). Negative associations observed between NO(2) and total IgE levels disappeared after including O(3) in the models. Neither SO(2) nor PM(10) were correlated with total IgE levels. CONCLUSIONS: Results suggest that O(3) or related ambient pollutants may up-regulate total IgE levels among asthmatic adults."

Currently, no compelling evidence exists that exposure to low levels of ozone leads to lasting impairment of pulmonary structure or function. One adverse health effect of ozone may be to change lung uptake or clearance functions for other inhaled air pollutants. As a test of this hypothesis, Fischer 344 rats were continuously exposed to 0.06 ppm ozone 7 days a week with a a low rise in ozone to a peak of 0.25 ppm and subsequent decrease to 0.06 ppm over a 9-h period five times each week for 6 wk. Three days after the end of ozone exposure, animals were exposed to aerosolized asbestos fibers for 5 h and examined immediately after or 30 days after exposure to asbestos. Filtered air control animals were simultaneously exposed to asbestos. immediately after the end of fiber exposure, lung asbestos fiber burden was similar in both groups. However, 1 month after exposure, fiber mass and fiber number were significantly greater (p < 0.05) in the lungs of animals exposed to ozone than in the lungs of those exposed to air. These findings suggest that ambient levels of ozone can impair clearance of fibrogenic and carcinogenic materials such as asbestos from the lungs and represent an important ad- verse effect of prolonged exposure to low levels of this oxidant gas."

Influenza virus pneumonitis causes severe acute lung damage that, upon resolution, is followed by a persistent alveolitis and parenchymal changes characterized by patchy interstitial pneumonia and collagen deposition in the affected areas. To determine whether oxidant exposure exacerbates the virus-induced alveolitis and residual lung damage, mice were infected by aerosol inhalation with influenza A virus and continuously exposed to 0.5 ppm ozone or ambient air. Noninfected control mice were exposed to either ambient air or ozone. On various days during the first month after infection, groups of mice were sacrificed and their lungs assessed for acute injury (lung lavage albumin, total and differential cell counts, wet/dry ratios, and morphometry). At 30, 60, 90, and 120 days after infection, groups of mice were sacrificed for total and differential lavage cell counts, lung hydroxyproline content, and morphometric analysis. Ozone exposure did not alter the proliferation of virus in the lungs as quantitated by infectious virus titers of lung homogenates at 1, 4, 7, 10, and 15 days after virus infection but mitigated the virus-induced acute lung injury by approximately 50%. After Day 30 a shift in the character of the pulmonary lesions was observed in that continuous exposure to ozone potentiated the postinfluenzal alveolitis and structural changes in the lung parenchyma. Additional studies suggest that the mechanism for the enhanced postinfluenzal lung damage may be related to the oxidant impairing the repair process of the acute influenzal lung damage. These data demonstrate that ozone exposure mitigates acute virus-induced lung injury and potentiates residual lung damage."

However, studies of health effects of long-term particulate air pollution have been less conclusive.

Objective To assess the relationship between long-term exposure to fine particulate air pollution and all-cause, lung cancer, and cardiopulmonary mortality.

Design, Setting, and Participants Vital status and cause of death data were collected by the American Cancer Society as part of the Cancer Prevention II study, an ongoing prospective mortality study, which enrolled approximately 1.2 million adults in 1982. Participants completed a questionnaire detailing individual risk factor data (age, sex, race, weight, height, smoking history, education, marital status, diet, alcohol consumption, and occupational exposures). The risk factor data for approximately 500 000 adults were linked with air pollution data for metropolitan areas throughout the United States and combined with vital status and cause of death data through December 31, 1998.

Main Outcome Measure All-cause, lung cancer, and cardiopulmonary mortality.

Results Fine particulate and sulfur oxide?related pollution were associated with all-cause, lung cancer, and cardiopulmonary mortality. Each 10-?g/m3 elevation in fine particulate air pollution was associated with approximately a 4%, 6%, and 8% increased risk of all-cause, cardiopulmonary, and lung cancer mortality, respectively. Measures of coarse particle fraction and total suspended particles were not consistently associated with mortality.

Conclusion Long-term exposure to combustion-related fine particulate air pollution is an important environmental risk factor for cardiopulmonary and lung cancer mortality."

Only one cohort study has reported the effect of long-term exposures on deaths, and little is known about effects of chronic ozone exposure on survival in susceptible populations. OBJECTIVE: We investigated whether ozone was associated with survival in four cohorts of persons with specific diseases in 105 US cities, treating ozone as a time varying exposure. METHODS: We used Medicare data (1985-2006), and constructed cohorts of persons hospitalized with chronic conditions that might predispose to ozone effects: chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), diabetes, congestive heart failure (CHF), and myocardial infarction (MI). Yearly warm-season average ozone was merged to the individual follow up in each city. We applied Cox's proportional hazard model for each cohort within each city, adjusting for individual risk factors, temperature and city specific long term trends. RESULTS: We found significant associations with a hazard ratio for mortality of 1.06 (95% Confidence Interval (CI): 1.03, 1.08) per 5 ppb increase in summer average ozone for persons with CHF, of 1.09 (95% CI: 1.06, 1.12) with MI, of 1.07 (95% CI: 1.04, 1.09) with COPD, and of 1.07 (95% CI: 1.05, 1.10) for diabetics. We also found that the effect varied by region, but that this was mostly explained by mean temperature, which is likely a surrogate of air conditioning use, and hence exposure. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study that follows persons with specific chronic conditions, and shows that long-term ozone exposure is associated with increased risk of death in these groups."

Methods: We conducted secondary analyses of data on blood pressure and blood biochemistry markers from the Social Environment and Biomarkers of Aging Study in Taiwan and air pollution data from the Taiwan Environmental Protection Administration in 2000. Associations of 1-year averaged criteria air pollutants (particulate matter with aerodynamic diameters <10??m (PM(10)) and <2.5??m (PM(2.5)), ozone (O(3)), nitrogen dioxide (NO(2)), sulfur dioxide and carbon monoxide) with systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, total cholesterol, triglycerides, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, fasting glucose, haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), interleukin 6 (IL-6) and neutrophils were explored by applying generalised additive models. 

Results: After controlling for potential confounders, we observed that increased 1-year averaged particulate air pollutants (PM(10) and PM(2.5)) and NO(2) were associated with elevated blood pressure, total cholesterol, fasting glucose, HbA1c, IL-6 and neutrophils. Associations of increased 1-year averaged O(3) with elevated blood pressure, total cholesterol, fasting glucose, HbA1c and neutrophils were also observed. In particular, our two-pollutant models showed that PM(2.5) was more significantly associated with end-point variables than two gaseous pollutants, O(3) and NO(2). 

Conclusions: Changes in blood pressure, blood lipids, blood sugar and haematological markers of inflammation are associated with long-term exposure to ambient air pollutants. This might provide a link between air pollution and atherosclerotic cardiovascular diseases."

Although the gestational age of interest is often early pregnancy, maternal addresses are not available for women who move during pregnancy when using maternal addresses abstracted from birth certificates. The aim of this study was to explore the extent of ambient air pollutant exposure misclassification due to maternal residential mobility during pregnancy among the subgroup of a New York birth cohort. The authors obtained the maternal addresses at birth from the New York Birth Certificate, and the maternal addresses by gestational age from the National Birth Defect Prevention Study for New York participants for the study period 1997-2002. Among the 1324 mothers, 172 (13.0%) moved once during pregnancy and 46 (3.5%) moved at least twice. When accounting for multiple addresses among some individuals, of the 218 mothers who moved, 38 (2.9%) moved in the 3rd to 8th weeks after conception (critical period, not exclusive from the 1st trimester), 80 (6.0%) moved in the 1st trimester, 112 (8.5%) in the 2nd trimester, and 51 (3.9%) in the 3rd trimester. Air monitoring data from the New York Department of Environmental Conservation were used as surrogates to compute the ambient ozone and PM(10) exposures for mothers with complete residential data. This study estimates exposure using maternal address at birth obtained from birth certificates, compared to exposure estimates when using maternal addresses by gestational age obtained from maternal interview, the gold standard. Average exposures during pregnancy were similar when using interview based versus birth certificate addresses (0.035 vs. 0.035 ppm for ozone, and 20.11 vs. 20.09 microg/m(3) for PM(10), respectively). Kappa statistics and percent agreement were calculated to measure the degree of agreement for dichotomous exposure measurements (<median vs.>=median) and weighted kappa for quartile exposure measurements by gestational age. All the statistics indicated a high agreement between the two measurements. For mothers who moved, the majority maintained their address in the same exposure region. Given the low mobility during pregnancy and the short distance moved, the exposure assignment did not change substantially when using the more accurate interview based addresses in this study. However, the level of observed agreement may decrease for studies that require smaller geographic zones for exposure assignments or with more mobile study populations."

These papers have mostly focused on commonly monitored air pollutants, primarily ozone (O(3)), particulate matter (PM), sulfur dioxide (SO(2)), carbon monoxide (CO), and nitrogen dioxide (NO(2)), and various indices of perinatal health, including fetal growth, pregnancy duration, and infant mortality. While most published studies have found some marker of air pollution related to some types of perinatal outcomes, variability exists in the nature of the pollutants and outcomes associated. Synthesis of the findings has been difficult for various reasons, including differences in study design and analysis. A workshop was held in September 2007 to discuss methodological differences in the published studies as a basis for understanding differences in study findings and to identify priorities for future research, including novel approaches for existing data. Four broad topic areas were considered: confounding and effect modification, spatial and temporal exposure variations, vulnerable windows of exposure, and multiple pollutants. Here we present a synopsis of the methodological issues and challenges in each area and make recommendations for future study. Two key recommendations include: (1) parallel analyses of existing data sets using a standardized methodological approach to disentangle true differences in associations from methodological differences among studies; and (2) identification of animal studies to inform important mechanistic research gaps. This work is of critical public health importance because of widespread exposure and because perinatal outcomes are important markers of future child and adult health."

This MiniReview (in conjunction with the May 2007 International Conference on Foetal Programming and Development Toxicity) highlights key methodological issues surrounding this research area, based on our experiences in Southern California. All 'criteria' air pollutants have been linked to birth outcomes. Our own studies found most consistent associations for carbon monoxide and particles. Traffic exhaust toxins are possible causative agents, but air monitoring data relied on by almost all existing studies inadequately capture their intracommunity variability in concentrations. Exposure assessment might be improved by biomarkers and land use-based regression modelling or information on time-activity patterns. Foetal development provides unique opportunities to study exposures acting during narrow susceptibility windows. A time-series approach by design controls for confounders that do not vary temporally but can only address short-term acute effects. Studies employing spatial or medium-term (trimester-specific) temporal contrasts may be more susceptible to residual confounding, and studies adjusting only for risk factors recorded on birth certificates have been criticized. Findings from our recent study in Southern California indicate that air pollution effect estimates are not markedly influenced by risk factors not provided on birth certificates. Yet, studies collecting detailed risk factor information in other geographic regions may be needed to further evaluate the extent of residual confounding in record-based analyses. Investigating biological mechanisms (e.g. using ultrasound measurements and biomarkers for hypothesized pathways) is an important remaining issue."

OBJECTIVES: The objectives of our international workshop were to discuss the current evidence, to identify the strengths and weaknesses of published epidemiologic studies, and to suggest future directions for research. DISCUSSION: Participants identified promising exposure assessment tools, including exposure models with fine spatial and temporal resolution that take into account time-activity patterns. More knowledge on factors correlated with exposure to air pollution, such as other environmental pollutants with similar temporal variations, and assessment of nutritional factors possibly influencing birth outcomes would help evaluate importance of residual confounding. Participants proposed a list of points to report in future publications on this topic to facilitate research syntheses. Nested case-control studies analyzed using two-phase statistical techniques and development of cohorts with extensive information on pregnancy behaviors and biological samples are promising study designs. Issues related to the identification of critical exposure windows and potential biological mechanisms through which air pollutants may lead to intrauterine growth restriction and premature birth were reviewed. CONCLUSIONS: To make progress, this research field needs input from toxicology, exposure assessment, and clinical research, especially to aid in the identification and exposure assessment of feto-toxic agents in ambient air, in the development of early markers of adverse reproductive outcomes, and of relevant biological pathways. In particular, additional research using animal models would help better delineate the biological mechanisms underpinning the associations reported in human studies."

A planning group with 10 members from 6 countries was formed to coordinate the project. Collaboration participants have datasets with air pollution values and birth outcomes. Eighteen research groups with data for approximately 20 locations in Asia, Australia, Europe, North America, and South America are participating, with most participating in an initial pilot study.

Almost all participants have some measure of particulate matter, and most have ozone, nitrogen dioxide, sulfur dioxide and carbon monoxide.

Surveys were scheduled for either late winter, after the season of higher air pollution, or at the end of summer, when pollution was low. Participation included a physical examination, donation of a semen sample, and completion of a questionnaire on health, personal habits, and exposure to solvents and metals through work or hobby. Analysis of data from 408 volunteers showed that the men from Teplice and Prachatice were similar in physical characteristics, personal habits, and work- or hobby-related exposures. Sixty-six percent (272) of these men donated a single semen sample for routine semen analysis, computer-aided sperm motion analysis, and sperm chromatin structure assay. The mean (median) sperm concentration and sperm count were 61.2 (44.0) million/mL semen and 113.3 (81.5) million, respectively, and were not associated with district of residence or period of elevated air pollution. However, periods of elevated air pollution in Teplice were significantly associated with decrements in other semen measures including proportionately fewer motile sperm, proportionately fewer sperm with normal morphology or normal head shape, and proportionately more sperm with abnormal chromatin. These results suggest that young men may experience alterations in sperm quality after exposure to periods of elevated air pollution, without changes in sperm numbers."

Selected biomarkers were analyzed in venous blood, cord blood (chromosomal aberrations, comet assay) and placenta (DNA adducts, genetic polymorphisms of GSTM1 and NAT2 genotypes) of women enrolled in a nested case-control study. DNA adduct levels were higher in polluted vs. control districts, in smoking vs. nonsmoking mothers, and in GSTM1 null genotype, which was more pronounced in polluted district. No effect of air pollution was observed by cytogenetic analysis of chromosomal aberrations or by comet assay. The reproductive development of young men was followed by measures of semen quality, adjusted for ambient SO2 exposure. The analysis identified significant associations with air pollution for <13% morphologically normal sperm, <29% sperm with normal head shape, <24% motile sperm. Analysis of aneuploidy in human sperm by FISH showed, aneuploidy YY8 was associated with season of heaviest air pollution. These findings are suggestive for an influence of air pollution on YY8 disomy. All these results indicate that air pollution may increase DNA damage in human population, which may be even higher for susceptible groups. Biomarkers of exposure (DNA adducts) and susceptibility (GSTM1 and NAT2) may indicate the risk of presumable low environmental exposure. Pregnancy outcome and semen studies imply that relatively low air pollution (higher than 40 Ag PM10/m3) can significantly increase the adverse reproductive outcomes affecting both genders.

The air pollution, resulting from combustion of coal for industry and home heating in the Teplice district of the Czech Republic, was much higher during the winter than at other times of year with peaks exceeding US air quality standards. METHODS: Young men from Teplice were sampled up to seven times over 2 years allowing evaluation of semen quality after periods of exposure to both low and high air pollution. Routine semen analysis (sperm concentration, motility and morphology) and tests for sperm aneuploidy and chromatin integrity were performed, comparing measurements within each subject. Exposure was classified as high or low based on data from ambient air pollution monitoring. RESULTS: Using repeated measures analysis, a significant association was found between exposure to periods of high air pollution (at or above the upper limit of US air quality standards) and the percentage of sperm with DNA fragmentation according to sperm chromatin structure assay (SCSA).

Outcomes included sperm concentration, total sperm per ejaculate (count), and morphology, as well as DNA integrity and chromatin maturity. Exposures to O3 and PM2.5 were evaluated for the 90-day period before sampling. We used multivariable linear regression, which included different levels of adjustment (i.e., without and with season and temperature) to assess the relationship between exposure to air pollutants during key periods of sperm development and adverse sperm outcomes.Results: Sperm concentration and count were not associated with exposure to PM2.5, but there was evidence of an association (but not statistically significant) with O3 concentration and decreased sperm concentration and count. Additionally, a significant increase in the percentage of sperm cells with cytoplasmic drop [beta = 2.64; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.215.06] and abnormal head (beta = 0.47; 95% CI, 0.030.92) was associated with PM2.5 concentration in the base model. However, these associations, along with all other sperm outcomes, were not significantly associated with either pollutant after controlling for season and temperature.

(p. 203) studied levels of ozone (O3) and PM2.5 (particulate matter < 2.5 microm in aerodynamic diameter) in association with semen outcomes among 228 presumed-fertile men residing in three southeastern U.S. counties. Exposures were classified based on measurements averaged across fixed monitoring stations in each county during the 90 days before sample collection. Outcomes included sperm concentration, count (per ejaculate) and morphology, and proxy measures of DNA integrity (sperm chromatin structure assay) and chromatin maturity (CMA assay). Associations with exposures during key time windows of sperm development were estimated using multivariable linear regression. The authors report crude inverse associations for O3 and sperm concentration and count, and positive associations for PM2.5 and the proportion of sperm cells with cytoplasmic drop and abnormal heads; however, associations did not persist after adjustment for season and temperature. Overall, O3 and PM2.5 exposures in the study population were not clearly associated with adverse outcomes, but the authors conclude that better characterized exposure estimates are needed to clarify relations between air pollutants and sperm quality."

Simultaneously, the animals were injected with the vitamins in 5-day intervals and at different doses (0.5, 1.5, 4.5, 5 and 15 mg of vitamin E; 0.5, 3, 9, and 50 mg of vitamin C; or both vitamins together, respectively). Gonad sections were PAS stained. In the ozonized males, depletion of germ cells occurred. In the vitamin E groups, the testes were comparable to the controls, excluding the 0.5-mg-dose vitamin E group in which perivascular fibrosis and intertubular hyalinization were observed. In the vitamin C groups, intertubular hyalinization, partial arrested spermatogenesis, and desquamation of the seminiferous epithelium appeared proportionall to the vitamin dose. Additionally, premature spermiation was found at a vitamin C dose of 50-mg. In the rats injected with both vitamins, hyalinization and fibrosis appeared in addition to partial arrest of spermatogenesis and vacuolar degeneration. In conclusion, vitamin E protects against the detrimental effects of ozone in rat testes irrespective of the dose applied. This was not observed for vitamin C.

Methods: We started to collect information about our own patient''s smoking habits in January 1996 to evaluate prospectively the influence on IVF success. Information regarding 799 patients (607 nonsmokers and 192 smokers) was obtained. Additionally we retrieved seven relevant publications from the unabridged MEDLINE1982?1996. They were recalculated to first cycles, because from a biometrical point of view, only the results of the first IVF cycle are really well comparable, as the number of necessary IVF cycles always correlates with the number of pregnancies. These data were compared in the nonparametric sign test according to Dixon?Mood and calculated as relative success ratios, defined as the quotient of the probability of IVF-ET success of nonsmokers divided by that of smokers for each publication.
Results: This meta-analysis, based on a total of 2314 first IVF-ET treatments, showed that almost twice as many IVF-ET cycles were needed for smokers as for nonsmokers to become pregnant. For the success quotient, we obtained a ratio of 1.79, with an associated 95% confidence interval of from 1.24 to 2.59. The total analysis shows, with a P value of less than 0.01, significantly higher pregnancy rates (21%) in nonsmokers compared to smokers (14%).

We hypothesized that declining air quality during in vitro fertilization (IVF) would adversely affect live birth rates. 

METHODS: Data from US Environmental Protection Agency air quality monitors and an established national-scale, log-normal kriging method were used to spatially estimate daily mean concentrations of criteria pollutants at addresses of 7403 females undergoing their first IVF cycle and at the their IVF labs from 2000 to 2007 in the Northeastern USA. These data were related to pregnancy outcomes. 

RESULTS: Increases in nitrogen dioxide (NO2) concentration both at the patient's address and at the IVF lab were significantly associated with a lower chance of pregnancy and live birth during all phases of an IVF cycle from medication start to pregnancy test [most significantly after embryo transfer, odds ratio (OR) 0.76, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.66?0.86, per 0.01 ppm increase]. Increasing ozone (O3) concentration at the patient's address was significantly associated with an increased chance of live birth during ovulation induction (OR 1.26, 95% CI 1.10?1.44, per 0.02 ppm increase), but with decreased odds of live birth when exposed from embryo transfer to live birth (OR 0.62, 95% CI 0.48?0.81, per 0.02 ppm increase). After modeling for interactions of NO2 and O3 at the IVF lab, NO2 remained negatively and significantly associated with live birth (OR 0.86, 95% CI 0.78?0.96), whereas O3 was non-significant. Fine particulate matter (PM2.5) at the IVF lab during embryo culture was associated with decreased conception rates (OR 0.90, 95% CI 0.82?0.99, per 8 ?g/m3 increase), but not with live birth rates. No associations were noted with sulfur dioxide or larger particulate matter (PM10). 

CONCLUSIONS: The effects of declining air quality on reproductive outcomes after IVF are variable, cycle-dependent and complex, though increased NO2 is consistently associated with lower live birth rates. Our findings are limited by the lack of direct measure of pollutants at homes and lab sites."

In particular, no data are available concerning the behavioral development of mouse offspring after maternal exposure, despite the fact that increasing use is made of this species in behavioral teratology studies for reasons both of economy and in order to increase the effectiveness of subsequent higher-tier studies (e.g., of treatment-genotype interactions). In the present work, female CD-1 mice were exposed during pregnancy (Days 7-17) to different O3 concentrations (0, 0.4, 0.8, or 1.2 ppm); to avoid confounding by postnatal maternal effects, all litters were assigned shortly after birth to foster dams neither treated nor handled during pregnancy. The dams' food and water intake and body weight gain were depressed in a concentration-dependent fashion. Tolerance to these effects developed during continuing exposure; such tolerance was faster in the case of food than water intake. Several measures of reproductive performance, such as proportion of pregnancies carried to term, litter size, sex ratio, frequency of stillbirth, and neonatal mortality, failed to show differences between control and O3 animals. Postnatal body weight gain was slightly but significantly depressed in the 1.2 ppm offspring. Otherwise, the somatic development of O3 pups was indistinguishable from that of controls, save for a delay in eye opening; this effect, however, failed to show a significant concentration dependence. Negative results were obtained in a wide range of assessments concerning (i) the development of various reflexes and responses (""Fox battery"") from birth to Day 18; (ii) ultrasonic emissions on Postnatal Days 3, 7, and 11; and (iii) activity, habituation, response to an unfamiliar object, and hyperactivity produced by a monoaminergic stimulant (d-amphetamine) at 60-61 days. The present data differ from those of a previous study on rats raised by their biological mothers after gestational exposure to O3 (1 and 1.5 ppm), which showed a substantial impairment in somatic and neurobehavioral development (R.

This difference, be it due to species factors, to postnatal maternal effects, or to the time of occurrence of maximal O3 effects (e.g., on food and water intake) after the onset of exposure and before adaptation or tolerance, may provide significant cues for the understanding of O3 effects in pregnant and developing organisms."

A review of the world literature and our own experience reveals that at 23 weeks gestation survival ranges from 2% to 35%. At 24 weeks gestation the range is 17% to 58%, and at 25 weeks gestation 35% to 85%. Differences in population descriptors, in the initiation and withdrawal of treatment and the duration of survival considered may account for the wide variations in the reported ranges of survival. Major neonatal morbidity increases with decreasing gestational age and birthweight. The rates of severe cerebral ultrasound abnormality range at 23 weeks gestation from 10% to 83%, at 24 weeks from 17% to 64% and at 25 weeks gestation from 10% to 22%. At 23 weeks gestation, chronic lung disease occurs in 57% to 70% of survivors, at 24 weeks in 33% to 89%, and at 25 weeks gestation in 16% to 71% of survivors. When compared to children born prior to the 1990's, the rates of neurodevelopmental disability have, in general, remained unchanged. Of 30 survivors reported at 23 weeks gestation nine (30%) are severely disabled. At 24 weeks gestation the rates of severe neurodevelopmental disability (including subnormal cognitive function, cerebral palsy, blindness and deafness) range from 17% to 45%, and at 25 weeks gestation 12% to 35% are similarly affected. In Cleveland, Ohio, we compared the outcomes of 114 children with birthweight 500?749 g born 1990?1992 to 112 infants born 1993?1995. Twenty month survival was similar (43% vs 38%). The use of antenatal and postnatal steroids increased (10% vs 54% and 43% vs 84%, respectively, P<0.001), however the rates of chronic lung disease increased from 41% to 63% (P=0.06). There was a significant increase in the rate of subnormal cognitive function at 20 months corrected age (20% vs 48%, P<0.02) and a trend to an increase in the rate of cerebral palsy (10% vs 16%) and neurodevelopmental impairment. We conclude that, with current methods of care, the limits of viability have been reached. The continuing toll of major neonatal morbidity and neurodevelopmental handicap are of serious concern."

Birth certificates provided maternal reproductive history and residence location at birth. Sociodemographic factors and maternal smoking during pregnancy were collected by questionnaire. Monthly average air pollutant levels were interpolated from monitors to the ZIP code of maternal residence at childbirth.

We examined effects of prenatal ambient pollution exposure on average birth weight and risk of low birth weight in full-term births.
Methods: We estimated average ambient air pollutant concentrations throughout pregnancy in the neighborhoods of women who delivered term singleton live births between 1996 and 2006 in California. We adjusted effect estimates of air pollutants on birth weight for infant characteristics, maternal characteristics, neighborhood socioeconomic factors, and year and season of birth.
Results: 3,545,177 singleton births had monitoring for at least one air pollutant within a 10 km radius of the tract or ZIP Code of the mother's residence. In multivariate models, pollutants were associated with decreased birth weight; -5.4 grams (95% confidence interval -6.8 g, -4.1 g) per ppm carbon monoxide, -9.0 g (-9.6 g, -8.4 g) per pphm nitrogen dioxide, -5.7 g (-6.6 g, -4.9 g) per pphm ozone, -7.7 g (-7.9 g, -6.6 g) per 10 ?g/m3 particulate matter under 10 ?m, -12.8 g (-14.3 g, -11.3 g) per 10 ?g/m3 particulate matter under 2.5 ?m, and -9.3 g (-10.7 g, -7.9 g) per 10 ?g/m3 of coarse particulate matter. With the exception of carbon monoxide, estimates were largely unchanged after controlling for co-pollutants. Effect estimates for the third trimester largely reflect the results seen from full pregnancy exposure estimates; greater variation in results is seen in effect estimates specific to the first and second trimesters.
Conclusions: This study indicates that maternal exposure to ambient air pollution results in modestly lower infant birth weight. A small decline in birth weight is unlikely to have clinical relevance for individual infants, and there is debate about whether a small shift in the population distribution of birth weight has broader health implications. However, the ubiquity of air pollution exposures, the responsiveness of pollutant levels to regulation, and the fact that the highest pollution levels in California are lower than those regularly experienced in other countries suggest that precautionary efforts to reduce pollutants may be beneficial for infant health from a population perspective."

In total, 39,338 single births were included in this study. The mean birth weight was 3383 ? 460 g and prevalence of low birth weight (LBW) was 2.46% for single births with a gestational age of 37-44 wk. After controlling for cofactors including infant sex, maternal residential city, education, medical risk factors, active tobacco use, drug use, alcohol use, prenatal care, mother's age, race and ethnicity of mothers, and weight gain of mothers, we found PM10 exposure in the third trimester of pregnancy to be a significant predictor of birth weight of newborns. A 10-Ag/m3 increase in the 24-h PM10 level in the third trimester of pregnancy can be associated with a birth-weight reduction of 11 g (95% CI: 2.3-19.8 g) using multiple linear regression; however, PM10 was not found to be related with the risk of LBW from logistic regression. CO and O3 were not found to be associated with birth weight or risk of LBW of newborns by the same modeling procedure. The results suggest PM10 could be a risk factor associated with birth-weight reduction of newborns in urban northern Nevada; however, the current level of PM10 is not a risk factor to increase the chance of LBW newborns."

We speculated that the effects we observed previously for carbon monoxide, particulate matter < 10 microm in aerodynamic diameter (PM10), and traffic density were attributable to toxins sorbed to primary exhaust particles. Focusing on CO, PM10, and particulate matter < 2.5 microm in aerodynamic diameter (PM2.5), we examined whether varying residential distances from monitoring stations affected risk estimates, because effect attenuation may result from local pollutant heterogeneity inadequately captured by ambient stations. We geocoded home locations, calculated the distance to the nearest air monitors, estimated exposure levels by pregnancy period, and performed logistic regression analyses for subjects living within 1-4 mi of a station. For women residing within a 1-mi distance, we observed a 27% increase in risk for high (> or = 75th percentile) first-trimester CO exposures and preterm birth and a 36% increase for high third-trimester pregnancy CO exposures and term LBW. For particles, we observed similar size effects during early and late pregnancy for both term LBW and preterm birth. In contrast, smaller or no effects were observed beyond a 1-mi distance of a residence from a station. Associations between CO and PM10 averaged over the whole pregnancy and term LBW were generally smaller than effects for early and late pregnancy. These new results for 1994-2000 generally confirm our previous observations for the period 1989-1993, again linking CO and particle exposures to term LBW and preterm birth. In addition, they confirm our suspicions about having to address local heterogeneity for these pollutants in Los Angeles."

Using birth certificate data for that period, we assembled a retrospective cohort of infants whose mothers resided within 2 miles of 1 of 18 CO monitoring stations. Based on the gestational age and birth date of each child, we estimated last-trimester exposure by averaging the corresponding 3 months of daily CO concentrations registered at the monitoring station closest to the mother's residence (determined from the birth certificate). Where data were available (at 6 stations), we also averaged measurements taken daily for nitrogen dioxide and ozone and those taken at 6-day intervals for particulate matter 10 Am (PM10) to approximate last-trimester exposures to other pollutants. Overall, the study cohort consisted of 125,573 singleton children, excluding infants born before 37 or after 44 weeks of gestation, those weighing below 1,000 or above 5,500 g at birth, those for whom fewer than 10 days of CO measurements were available during the last trimester, and those whose mothers suffered from hypertension, diabetes, or uterine bleeding during pregnancy. Within the cohort, 2,813 (2.2%) were low in birth weight (between 1,000 and 2,499 g). Exposure to higher levels of ambient CO (>5.5 ppm 3-month average) during the last trimester was associated with a significantly increased risk for low birth weight [odds ratio (OR) = 1.22; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.03-1.44] after adjustment for potential confounders, including commuting habits in the monitoring area, sex of the child, level of prenatal care, and age, ethnicity, and education of the mother."

The purpose of this study was to examine the association between LBW among term infants and ambient air pollution, by trimester of exposure, in a region of lower level exposures. METHODS: The relationship between LBW and ambient levels of particulate matter up to 10 um in diameter (PM10), sulfur dioxide (SO2) and ground-level ozone (O3) was evaluated using the Nova Scotia Atlee Perinatal Database and ambient air monitoring data from the Environment Canada National Air Pollution Surveillance Network and the Nova Scotia Department of Environment. The cohort consisted of live singleton births (> or =37 weeks of gestation) between January 1, 1988 and December 31, 2000. Maternal exposures to air pollution were assigned to women living within 25 km of a monitoring station at the time of birth. Air pollution was evaluated as a continuous and categorical variable (using quartile exposures) for each trimester and relative risks were estimated from logistic regression, adjusted for confounding variables. RESULTS: There were 74,284 women with a term, singleton birth during the study period and with exposure data. In the analyses unadjusted for year of birth, first trimester exposures in the highest quartile for SO2 and PM10 suggested an increased risk of delivering a LBW infant (relative risk = 1.36, 95% confidence interval = 1.04 to 1.78 for SO2 exposure and relative risk = 1.33, 95% confidence interval = 1.02 to 1.74 for PM10). After adjustment for birth year, the relative risks were attenuated somewhat and not statistically significant. A dose-response relationship for SO2 was noted with increasing levels of exposure. No statistically significant effects were noted for ozone. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that exposure during the first trimester to relatively low levels of some air pollutants may be associated with a reduction in birth weight in term-born infants. These findings have implications for the development of effective risk management strategies to minimize the public health impacts for pregnant women."

The effects of pollutant exposure in the first, second, and third trimesters of pregnancy on risk of ""small for gestational age"" (SGA), and of pollutant exposure during pregnancy on birth weight were examined. RESULTS: There were 138,056 singleton births in Sydney between 1998 and 2000; 9.7% of babies (13,402) were classified as SGA. Air pollution levels in Sydney were found to be quite low. In linear regression models carbon monoxide and nitrogen dioxide concentrations in the second and third trimesters had a statistically significant adverse effect on birth weight. For a 1 part per million increase in mean carbon monoxide levels a reduction of 7 (95% CI -5 to 19) to 29 (95% CI 7 to 51) grams in birth weight was estimated. For a 1 part per billion increase in mean nitrogen dioxide levels a reduction of 1 (95% CI 0 to 2) to 34 (95% CI 24 to 43) grams in birth weight was estimated. Particulate matter (diameter less than ten microns) in the second trimester had a small statistically significant adverse effect on birth weight. For a 1 microgram per cubic metre increase in mean particulate matter levels a reduction of 4 grams (95% CI 3 to 6) in birth weight was estimated.

We also examined head circumference (HC) and crown-heel length (CHL) among a sub-sample (n=21,432) of the term neonates. Maternal exposure to PM(10), visibility reducing particles (bsp), O(3) and NO(2) was assessed by calculating average exposure estimates over months and trimesters of pregnancy based on a citywide average of the pollutants. Linear and logistic regression models were employed to examine the effect of these pollutants on the birth outcomes after adjusting for potential confounders and season of birth. The regression coefficients were based on an inter-quartile range (IQR) increase in exposure as well as quartiles of exposure with the lowest used as a reference category. Trimester- and monthly specific exposures to all pollutants were not significantly associated with a reduction in either birth weight or HC, or an increased risk of SGA. An IQR increase in NO(2) during the third trimester was associated with a reduction in CHL (beta=-0.15cm, 95% CI -0.25 to -0.05cm) and this was concentrated around exposure during month nine. No other pollutants were associated with a reduction in CHL. In conclusion, there was no strong evidence suggesting that ambient air pollution during pregnancy is associated with sub-optimal fetal growth in Brisbane."

The aim of this study is to explore the association between exposure to outdoor air pollution during pregnancy and birth weight. DESIGN: Cross sectional study using data on all singleton full term live births during a one year period. For each individual birth, information on gestational age, type of delivery, birth weight, sex, maternal education, maternal age, place of residence, and parity was available. Daily mean levels of PM(10), sulphur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide, carbon monoxide, and ozone were also gathered. The association between birth weight and air pollution was assessed in regression models with exposure averaged over each trimester of pregnancy. SETTING: Sao Paulo city, Brazil. RESULTS: Birth weight was shown to be associated with length of gestation, maternal age and instruction, infant gender, number of antenatal care visits, parity, and type of delivery. On adjusting for these variables negative effects of exposure to PM(10) and carbon monoxide during the first trimester were observed. This effect seemed to be more robust for carbon monoxide. For a 1 ppm increase in mean exposure to carbon monoxide during the first trimester a reduction of 23 g in birth weight was estimated. CONCLUSIONS: The results are consistent in revealing that exposure to air pollution during pregnancy may interfere with weight gain in the fetus. Given the poorer outlook for low birthweight babies on a number of health outcomes, this finding is important from the public health perspective."

The study infants comprised 92,288 full-term live singletons identified from the Taiwan birth registry and born in the city of Taipei or Kaoshiung in Taiwan between 1995 and 1997. Maternal exposures to various air pollutants including CO, SO2, O3, NO2, and PM10 in each trimester of pregnancy was estimated as the arithmetic means of all daily measurements taken by the air quality monitoring station nearest to the district of residence of the mother at birth. The multivariable logistic regression model with adjustment for potential confounders was used to assess the independent effect of specific air pollutants on the risk of term LBW. This study suggested a 26% increase in term LBW risk given maternal ambient exposure to SO2 concentration exceeding 11.4 ppb during pregnancy compared to low exposure (<7.1 ppb) (OR=1.26, 95% CI=1.04-1.53).

Indeed, both share a common pathway composed of uterine contractility, cervical dilatation and activation of the membranes/decidua. This review explores the concept that while term labour results from physiological activation of the components of the common pathway, preterm labour arises from pathological signalling and activation of one or more components of the common pathway of parturition. The term 'great obstetrical syndromes' has been coined to reframe the concept of obstetrical disease. Such syndromes are characterised by: (1) multiple aetiology; (2) long preclinical stage; (3) frequent fetal involvement; (4) clinical manifestations that are often adaptive in nature; and (5) gene?environment interactions that may predispose to the syndromes. This article reviews the evidence indicating that the pathological processes implicated in the preterm parturition syndrome include: (1) intrauterine infection/inflammation; (2) uterine ischaemia; (3) uterine overdistension; (4) abnormal allograft reaction; (5) allergy; (6) cervical insufficiency; and (7) hormonal disorders (progesterone related and corticotrophin-releasing factor related).

Maternal exposures to sulfur dioxide (SO2), total suspended particles (TSP), and nitrous oxides (NOx) in each trimester of pregnancy were estimated as the arithmetic means of all daily measurements taken by all monitors in the district of birth of each infant. Oddsratios of low birth weight (< 2500 g), prematurity (< 37 weeks of gestation), and intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR; < 10th percentile of birth weight for gestational age and sex) were estimated by robust logistic regression. The median (and 25th and 75th percentile) trimester exposures were 32(18, 56) mug/m3 for SO2; 72 (55, 87) mug/m3 for TSP; and 38 (23, 59) mug/m3 for NOx. Low birth weight (prevalence 5.2%) and prematurity (prevalence 4.8%) were associated with SO2 and somewhat less strongly with TSP. IUGR was not associated with any pollutant. The effects on low birth weight and prematurity were marginally stronger for exposures in the first trimester, and were not attenuated at all by adjustment for socioeconomic factors or the month of birth. Adjusted odds ratios of low birth weight were 1.20 [95% confidence interval (CI), 1.11-1.30] and 1.15 (CI, 1.07-1.24) for a 50 mug/m3 increase in SO2 and TSP, respectively, in thefirst trimester; adjusted odds ratios of prematurity were 1.27 (CI, 1.16-1.39) and 1.18 (CI, 1.05-1.31) for a 50 mug/m3 increase in SO2 and TSP, respectively, in the first trimester. Low gestational age accounted forthe association between SO2 and low birth weight. These findings provide further support for the hypothesis that air pollution can affect the outcome of pregnancy."

Using a survey of 2,543 of 6,374 women sampled from a cohort of 58,316 eligible births in 2003 in Los Angeles County, California, the authors estimated with logistic regression and two-phase models the effects of pregnancy period-specific air pollution exposure on the odds of preterm birth. For the first trimester, the odds of preterm birth consistently increased with increasing carbon monoxide exposures and also at high levels of exposure to particulate matter less than or equal to 2.5 ?m in diameter (>21.4 ?g/m3), regardless of type of data (cohort/sample) or covariate adjustment (carbon monoxide exposures of >1.25 ppm increased the odds by 21-25%). Women exposed to carbon monoxide above 0.91 ppm during the last 6 weeks of pregnancy experienced increased odds of preterm birth. Crude and birth certificate covariate-adjusted results for carbon monoxide differed from each other. However, further adjustment for risk factors assessed in the survey did not change effect estimates for short-term pollutant averages appreciably, except for time-activity patterns, which strengthened the observed associations. These results confirm the importance of reducing exposure misclassification when evaluating the effect of traffic-related pollutants that vary spatially. "

While several studies have suggested that high levels of air pollution or exposure to particular climatic factors may be associated with an increased risk of preterm birth, other studies do not support such an association. To determine whether exposure to various environmental factors place a large London-based population at higher risk for preterm birth, we analyzed 482,568 births that occurred between 1988 and 2000 from the St. Mary's Maternity Information System database.

Using an ecological study design, any short-term associations between preterm birth and various environmental factors were investigated using time-series regression techniques. Environmental exposures included air pollution (ambient ozone and PM10) and climatic factors (temperature, rainfall, sunshine, relative humidity, barometric pressure, and largest drop in barometric pressure). In addition to exposure on the day of birth, cumulative exposure up to 1 week before birth was investigated.

The risk of preterm birth did not increase with exposure to the levels of ambient air pollution or meteorological factors experienced by this population. Cumulative exposure from 0 to 6 days before birth also did not show any significant effect on the risk of preterm birth. This large study, covering 13 years, suggests that there is no association between preterm births and recent exposure to ambient air pollution or recent changes in the weather."

Objective? To assess preterm birth (PTB) in relation to maternal exposure to ambient air pollution.

Design? Retrospective cohort.

Setting? Brisbane, Australia.

Sample? A total of 28 200 singleton live births for the period of 1 July 2000 to 30 June 2003.

Methods? Average maternal exposure estimates for ambient particulate matter (PM10 and bsp), ozone (O3) and nitrogen dioxide were calculated over the first 3 months after last menstrual period (LMP) and the last 3 months prior to birth (individually and combined as trimesters).

Main outcome measures? PTB was defined as gestation <37 weeks and odds ratios (OR) were calculated for PTB per interquartile range increase in the maternal exposure estimate for each pollutant. Various covariates were controlled for, including season of birth.

Results? Exposure to PM10 and O3 during trimester one was associated with an increased risk of PTB (OR = 1.15, 95% CI 1.06?1.25 and OR = 1.26, 95% CI 1.10?1.45, respectively).

METHODS: We examined the effect of ambient air pollution on preterm birth using time-series approach in Shanghai in 2004. This method can eliminate potential confounding by individual risk factors that do not change over a short period of time. Daily numbers of preterm births were obtained from the live birth database maintained by Shanghai Municipal Center of Disease Control and Prevention. We used the generalized additive model (GAM) with penalized splines to analyze the relation between preterm birth, air pollution, and covariates.

RESULTS: We observed a significant effect of outdoor air pollution only with 8-week exposure before preterm births. An increase of 10 microg/m3 of 8-week average PM10, SO2, NO2, and O3 corresponded to 4.42% (95%CI 1.60%, 7.25%), 11.89% (95%CI 6.69%, 17.09%), 5.43% (95%CI 1.78%, 9.08%), and 4.63% (95%CI 0.35%, 8.91%) increase of preterm birth. We did not find any significant acute effect of outdoor air pollution on preterm birth in the week before birth.

CONCLUSION: Ambient air pollution may contribute to the risk of preterm birth in Shanghai. Our analyses also strengthen the rationale for further limiting air pollution level in the city."

To our knowledge, this proposition has never been tested with high-frequency longitudinal ultrasound data from normally growing human fetuses. The present study examined whether fetal growth in leg length had its peak velocity at or about 20-26 gestational weeks and declined subsequently and whether estimated fetal weight velocity was maximal at or about 33 weeks and declined subsequently; if the greatest acquisition of leg length occurred in the second trimester and weight in the third trimester; and if birth outcomes reflected these relationships. The data in this study included approximately weekly longitudinal ultrasound data collected from 44 maternal/fetal pairs in Brussels, Belgium. Diaphyseal lengths of the femur and tibia provided information on leg growth and estimated fetal weight was assessed from the biparietal and occipital-frontal head diameters and transverse and anterior-posterior diameters of the abdomen. Growth patterns were investigated from individual growth curves derived from daily growth velocity z-scores. Paired t-tests compared individuals' trimestral increments in leg length and fetal weight. Least-squares regression models employing the robust procedure for repeated measurements were used to test for relationships between trimester, size, growth rates, and birth outcome, controlling for day of measurement, sex, maternal smoking, and gestational age at birth. The normal fetuses in this study grew by pulsatile patterns of leg and estimated weight acquisition, not a single peak and decline process. Greater incremental growth in estimated fetal weight occurred during the second trimester and leg length in the third trimester. Individual and sex effects were significant in growth velocity patterns. Girls grew with greater synchrony between leg and weight growth and were accelerated by comparison with boys, with faster leg growth predicting lower ponderal index by the second trimester. Birth outcomes were sex-specific in timing effects and predictive variables. These results support the importance of sex-specific analyses, reemphasize the common notion that girls grow faster than boys, and direct attention to cross-talk between energy resources and growth.

According to the recent literature, clinical classification of the retarded babies seems to be less significant. Among the etiologic factors responsible for IUGR, one-third of the variations in birth weight are determined by genetic variables, two-thirds by environmental factors. In spite of the fact that a long list of established, different etiologic factors is known, in at least 40% of children no underlying pathology can be identified.

We obtained ambient air pollutant data from air monitoring sites in New Jersey for carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), ozone (O3), sulfur dioxide (SO(2)), particulate matter <10 mum in aerodynamic diameter (PM10) and particulate matter <2.5 mum in aerodynamic diameter (PM2.5).

RESULTS: Based on logistic regression analyses for each contaminant and all contaminants together, there were no consistent elevated associations between selected air pollutants and cleft malformations. Quartile of CO concentration showed a consistent protective association with CPO (p < 0.01). For other contaminants, confidence intervals (95%) of the odds ratios for some quartiles excluded one. CLP showed limited evidence of an association with increasing SO(2) exposure while CPO showed weak associations with increasing O3 exposure.

Data sources and extraction: From bibliographic searches we extracted ten original epidemiological studies that examined the association between congenital anomaly risk and concentrations of air pollutants. Meta-analyses were conducted if at least four studies published risk estimates for the same pollutant and anomaly group. Summary risk estimates were calculated for 1) risk at high versus low exposure level in each study, and 2) risk per unit increase in continuous pollutant concentration. 

Data synthesis: Each individual study reported statistically significantly increased risks for some combinations of air pollutants and congenital anomalies, among many combinations tested. In meta-analyses, NO2 and SO2 exposures were related to increases in risk of coarctation of the aorta (OR per 10 ppb NO2=1.17, 95%CI 1.00-1.36; OR per 1 ppb SO2=1.07, 95%CI 1.01, 1.13) and tetralogy of Fallot (OR per 10ppb NO2=1.20, 95%CI 1.02, 1.42; OR per 1 ppb SO2=1.03, 95%CI 1.01, 1.05), and PM10 exposure to an increased risk of atrial septal defects (OR per 10 ?g/m3=1.14, 95%CI 1.01, 1.28). Meta-analyses found no statistically significant increase in risk of other cardiac anomalies and oral clefts. 

Conclusions: We find some evidence for an effect of ambient air pollutants on congenital cardiac anomaly risk. Improvements in the areas of exposure assessment, outcome harmonization, assessment of other congenital anomalies, and mechanistic knowledge are needed to advance this field."

Lambs were exposed to air (controls) or to 1 ppm O3 for 4 h/day for 5 days during the 1st wk of life. Tracheal mucus velocity (TMV), a marker of lung mucociliary clearance, was measured in vivo at birth (0 wk) and up to 24 wk later, and tracheal secretory function was measured (in vitro) and the morphology of the tracheal mucosa was determined at 0 and 2 wk in both groups. In the control group, TMV increased 94% from 0 to 2 wk (P less than 0.05), continued to increase until reaching a plateau at 8 wk, and then remained constant from 8 to 24 wk. In contrast, O3-exposed lambs showed a 24% decrease in TMV from 0 to 2 wk (P less than 0.05 vs. control), and throughout the remaining time TMV remained below (P less than 0.05) that observed in control lambs. O3 exposure partially prevented the age-dependent decrease in basal secretion of tracheal macromolecules normally observed between 0 and 2 wk. These changes in secretory function were associated with a significant increase in tissue conductance (37%, P less than 0.05 vs. 0 wk), predominantly the result of active chloride secretion. The functional changes induced by O3 were associated with a retardation of the normal morphological development of the tracheal epithelium.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

Six lambs were killed at birth and 12 lambs at age 2 weeks. Of the latter 12, six were exposed to O3 (1 ppm, 4 hours daily for 5 days during the 1st week of life) and five had air-sham exposures (controls). Tracheal glycoconjugates were localized in situ with lectins to detect N-acetyl-galactosamine (galNAc), alpha-D-galactose (alpha-gal), beta-D-gal(1----3)-galNAc (beta-gal), and fucose (fuc). Mean (+/- SD) epithelial cell density (cells/mm basal lamina) was 418 +/- 57 in the newborns, 385 +/- 63 in controls (P was not significant), and 342 +/- 47 in O3-exposed lambs (P less than 0.05). Mucous cell density was 87 +/- 12 in newborns, 63 +/- 10 in controls (P less than 0.05), and 76 +/- 10 in O3 exposed lambs (P was not significant). Ciliated cells remained unchanged from birth to 2 weeks (P was not significant), but decreased (P less than 0.05) in O3-exposed lambs. All counted mucous cells contained fuc and galNAc at birth and retained these residues after sham and O3 exposure. The alpha-gal-containing mucous cells declined from 97 +/- 13 to 7 +/- 1 (P less than 0.05) and beta-gal containing cells from 39 +/- 5 to 25 +/- 4 in controls. In contrast, cells containing alpha-gal 71 +/- 10 remained at newborn levels (97 +/- 13) and beta-gal-containing cells increased from 40 +/- 5 at birth to 58 +/- 8 in O3-exposed animals (P less than 0.05). It was concluded that early postnatal exposure of lambs to O3 causes a decrease in epithelial cell density, but retards the developmental decrease in the number of tracheal mucous cells and alters the lectin detectable carbohydrate composition of mucus in these cells. These developmental defects were interpreted to be the morphologic correlates of the previously shown effects of O3 on the maturation of secretory function and mucus transport."

Twelve pregnant Wistar rats, six controls and six exposed to 1 ppm O3 inhalation during 12 h per day, were used. The rats were sacrificed at gestational days 18, 20 and 21; the fetuses were obtained and their lungs dissected. The ultrastructural analysis evidenced swollen mitochondria, cytoplasmic vacuolization of the epithelial cells and structural disorder caused by the oxidative stress. At gestation day 20, flake-off epithelial cells and laminar bodies in the bronchiolar lumen were observed. In the 21-gestation-day group, the mitochondria were edematous and their cristae were disrupted by the damage caused in mitochondrial membranes."

This study was performed to determine whether in utero exposure to TS influences the pulmonary response of newborn rat pups to ozone (O?). Timed pregnant Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats were exposed to TS or air for 3 h/d from gestation d 7 through 21. The pulmonary response of pups was assessed following a single 3-h exposure to air or 0.6 ppm O? on d 13 after birth. In all, 4 exposure groups were evaluated: (1) Air/Air (in utero air and postnatal air), (2) Air/O? (in utero air and postnatal O?), (3) TS/Air (in utero TS and postnatal air), and (4) TS/O? (in utero TS and postnatal O?). Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) was performed, and BAL cells and fluid were analyzed. Data revealed a significant increase in polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN) and total BALF protein in the Air/O? group compared to the Air/Air control, reflecting the inflammatory and cytotoxic effects of O?. However, in utero exposure to TS attenuated PMN infiltration into the air spaces for recovery in the BAL of TS/O? pups. Lung tissue myeloperoxidase activity significantly increased only in the TS/O? group but not in Air/O? pups, thus suggesting that PMN are sequestered in the lung tissue and that the in utero TS likely inhibits O?-mediated influx of PMN into the air spaces. Lung tissue analyses further showed a significant rise in manganese superoxide dismutase (SOD) protein and a decrease in extracellular SOD protein in the Air/O? group, suggesting oxidative effects of O?. Interestingly, in utero TS exposure again suppressed these effects in the TS/O? group. Overall, results suggest that in utero exposure to TS alone produced minimal acute pulmonary effects in newborn rats, but modulated adverse effects of postnatal O? exposure. The results are contrary to the interactive toxic responses predicted for sequential exposures to TS and O?, and may represent the development of &quot;cross-tolerance.&quot;"

Control mice received a sham exposure. All mice were tested at 12-13 weeks of age for their ability to find a submerged platform in a fixed location (acquisition: 18 trials, six trials per day) and for capacity to re-orient towards a new platform position (reversal: 12 trials, six trials per day). Exposure to O3 did not produce any significant impairment of swimming navigation during the acquisition phase while it slightly increased the swimming paths during the last day of the reversal phase. Mice exposed to O3 showed a slightly but significantly higher swimming speed during all the days, which was unrelated to differences in body weight and to navigational performances. Moreover, mice exposed to O3 (with the exception of one animal) had a strong tendency to make turns to the left while the controls, independent of sex, preferred clockwise turns. Data are discussed with respect to possible implications with early CNS and immune alteration leading to behavioral asymmetries at adulthood."

If hippocampal structural variations are causing behavioral variations, one must predict positive correlations between the extent of the IIP-MF and performance in swimming navigation. Thus, the authors studied learning and reversal learning of swimming navigation in mice in which the size of the IIP-MF had been randomized by means of systematic crosses and in 2 mouse strains known for differential infrapyramidal projections (C57BL/6 and DBA/2). In 19 random-bred mice (9 male, 10 female), the extent of the IIP-MF showed negative correlations with swimming time after platform reversal (day 4: r = -0.50, P < .03; day 5 r = -0.73, P < .001), but none during acquisition of the task. In addition, statistical analysis suggested an influence of asymmetrically distributed mossy fiber projections during reversal learning. The strain comparison between 18 DBA/2 and 16 C57BL/6 male mice confirmed these results: no strain difference during days 1-3, and a significantly faster swimming time in the strain C57BL/6 (with large IIP-MF) at day 5 (second day of reversal), associated with significantly more crossings of the former platform location during the early phases of reversal learning. This latter measure was also negatively correlated with asymmetry of the IIP-MF in both strains. Finally, variations of the IIP-MF were correlated partially with adjustment of swimming speed that appeared to depend on size and asymmetry of CA4 as well. Thus, natural variations in the size of the IIP-MF distribution, and, perhaps, of CA4, appear to linearly influence processes directly involved in complex spatial learning."

On PND 70 the subjects were tested for handedness using a paw preference task assessing both the animals' capability to reach a food pellet in a feeding tube and the individual preference for the use of one of the other forepaw. O3 exposure did not affect the animals' capability to learn the task but caused changes in handedness. Specifically, females exposed to the intermediate O3 concentration showed a reduced preference for the right paw than both their same-sex controls and 0.6 ppm males. On PND 100, mice underwent a hot plate test after IP treatment by either saline or morphine HCl (10 mg/kg). The results were generally in the direction of reduced drug sensitivity after exposure to the highest concentration. The evidence for this effect was more robust in the case of an organised avoidance response (wall-rearing) than in the case of a reflexive response (limb withdrawal); in the case of the former, latency data showed an effect on both males and females while frequency data showed an effect only in females. Overall, the O3 effects are suggestive of subtle CNS changes affecting mouse behavioural responses."

It is phytotoxic and an important cause of lung dysfunction. The lungs are the most important barrier that the organism has against ozone exposure. They act as a defense mechanism by the production of superoxide dismutase, catalase and glutathione peroxidase. If free radicals cannot be handled by the lung, they diffuse to other organs, where an oxidative stress state can be induced that may affect the whole organism. There is evidence that exposure to ozone may induce alterations in many systems. In relation to the CNS, studies have described headache, somnolence and fatigue in humans exposed to this gas. In rats and cats, diminished motor activity, decrease in operant conditioning response and alterations in the electrographic aspects of sleep-wake organization have been seen.

The concentrations used were 0, 0.2, 0.4, and 0.6 ppm; the lowest-observed-effect levels for eye irritation and respiratory function are in the range of 0.08-0.2 ppm for both humans and animals (47). Ozone failed to produce significant effects on either reproductive performance, postnatal somatic and neurobehavioral development (as assessed by a Fox test battery) or adult motor activity (including within-session habituation). In social interaction tests performed in the pre-juvenile period (23-25 days) and the juvenile period (43-45 days), social response endpoints were not modified in O3 mice, but exploration and self-grooming showed concentration dependent effects (decrease and increase, respectively). Performance at 84-98 days in an eight-arm radial maze with water reinforcement was initially impaired in O3 mice, but the results were not entirely consistent; e.g., the data failed to show a concentration dependence of the effects. Overall, the data confirm previous results of an experiment with more limited exposure [pregnancy Days 7-17 (6)] by showing that prenatal O3 exposure, even when extended to include a period before the start of pregnancy and the preimplantation phase, does not produce major or widespread somatic and neurobehavioral effects. Some of the results, however, point to subtle or borderline behavioral deficits which deserve to be considered both in further animal experiments and in the assessment of risk to developing humans. In fact, the latter are often exposed to O3 concentrations which exceed the lowest-observed-effect levels indicated above as well as those of the prolonged exposure guideline in WHO recommendations [0.05-0.06 ppm (47)]."

METHODS: Linking birth and death certificates for infants who died between 1989 and 2000, we identified all infant deaths, matched 10 living control subjects to each case subject, and assigned the nearest air monitoring station to each birth address. For all subjects, we calculated average carbon monoxide, nitrogen dioxide, ozone, and particulate matter < 10 microm in aerodynamic diameter exposures experienced during the 2-week, 1-month, 2-month, and 6-month periods before a case subject's death. RESULTS: The risk of respiratory death increased from 20% to 36% per 1-ppm increase in average carbon monoxide levels 2 weeks before death in early infancy (age: 28 days to 3 months). We also estimated 7% to 12% risk increases for respiratory deaths per 10-microg/m3 increase in particulate matter < 10 microm in aerodynamic diameter exposure experienced 2 weeks before death for infants 4 to 12 months of age. Risk of respiratory death more than doubled for infants 7 to 12 months of age who were exposed to high average levels of particulates in the previous 6 months. Furthermore, the risk of dying as a result of sudden infant death syndrome increased 15% to 19% per 1-part per hundred million increase in average nitrogen dioxide levels 2 months before death. Low birth weight and preterm infants seemed to be more susceptible to air pollution-related death resulting from these causes; however, we lacked statistical power to confirm this heterogeneity with formal testing. CONCLUSIONS: Our results add to the growing body of literature implicating air pollution in infant death from respiratory causes and sudden infant death syndrome and provide additional information for future risk assessment."

City- specific estimates were pooled across cities in a fixed- effects meta- regression to provide a mean estimate.Results: Few associations were observed between infant deaths and most pollutants studied. The exception was sulphur dioxide (SO2), of which a 10 mu g/m(3) increase was associated with a RR of 1.02 (95% CI 1.01 to 1.04) in all infant deaths. The effect was present in both neonatal and postneonatal deaths.Conclusions: Continuing reductions in SO2 levels in the UK may yield additional health benefits for infants."

To investigate the evidence for such an association, we conducted a time-series study of infant mortality in the southwestern part of Mexico City in the years 1993 to 1995 using mortality data from death registrations and air pollution measurements from a monitoring station we operated. Excess infant mortality was associated with the level of fine particles in the days before death, with the strongest association observed for the average concentration of fine particles during the period 3 to 5 days previously: a 10-microg m3 increase in the mean level of fine particles during these 3 days was associated with a 6.9% excess of infant deaths (95% confidence interval 2.5-11.3%). Infant mortality was also associated with the levels of nitrogen dioxide and ozone 3 to 5 days before death, but not as consistently as with particles."

Generalized additive Poisson regression models were used and nonparametric smooth functions (loess) were adopted to control long-term trend, temperature, humidity, and short-term trends. A linear term was used for holidays. The association between air pollutants and neonatal deaths showed a short time lag. Interquartile range increases in PM10 (23.3 microg/m(3)) and SO2 (9.2 microg/m(3)) were associated with increases of 4% (95% CI, 2-6) and 6% (95% CI, 4-8), respectively. Instead of adopting a two-pollutant model we created an index to represent PM10 and SO2 effects. For an interquartile range increase in the index an increase of 6.3% (95% CI, 6.1-6.5) in neonatal deaths was observed. These results agree with previous studies performed by our group showing the deleterious effects of air pollutants during the perinatal period. The method reported here represents an alternative approach to analyze the relationship between highly correlated pollutants and public health problems, reinforcing the idea of the synergic effects of air pollutants in public health."

METHODS: We linked county-specific monitoring data for particles with aerodiameter of < or = 2.5 microm (PM2.5) and < or = 10 microm (PM10), ozone, sulfur dioxide, and carbon monoxide to birth and death records for infants born from 1999 to 2002 in U.S. counties with > 250,000 residents. For each infant, we calculated the average concentration of each pollutant over the first 2 months of life. We used logistic generalized estimating equations to estimate odds ratios of postneonatal mortality for all causes, respiratory causes, sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS), and all other causes for each pollutant, controlling for individual maternal factors (race, marital status, education, age, and primiparity), percentage of county population below poverty, region, birth month, birth year, and other pollutants. This analysis includes about 3.5 million births, with 6,639 postneonatal infant deaths. RESULTS: After adjustment for demographic and other factors and for other pollutants, we found adjusted odds ratios of 1.16 [95% confidence interval (CI), 1.06-1.27] for a 10-mug/m3 increase in PM10 for respiratory causes and 1.20 (95% CI, 1.09-1.32) for a 10-ppb increase in ozone and deaths from SIDS. We did not find relationships with other pollutants and for other causes of death (control category). CONCLUSIONS: This study supports particulate matter air pollution being a risk factor for respiratory-related postneonatal mortality and suggests that ozone may be associated with SIDS in the United States."

OBJECTIVE: To assess the association of particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter of ?10?m (PM(10)) and ozone (O(3)) on infant mortality and its modification by SES.

METHODS: We evaluated the relationship of 24 h mean PM(10) and 1h daily maximum O(3) levels with 12?079 all-cause deaths (3903 respiratory deaths) among 1- to 11-month-old infants residing in the Mexico City Metropolitan Area between January 1997 and December 2005 using a case-crossover approach. The data were analysed using conditional logistic regression models, controlling for weather conditions and day of the week.

RESULTS: Single-effect models showed, for all-cause mortality, increases of 5.5% (95% CI 1% to 10%) at lag1 and 6.6% (2% to 11.4%) at lag2; cumulative exposure models (0-2 days) showed an increase of 6.3% (0.01% to 32.7%). Respiratory mortality increased marginally at 5.3% (-0.02% to 13.2%) with a 1-day lag and 10% (2.1% to 18%) with a 2-day lag per increase of 38.7 ?g/m(3) (IQR) in PM(10) levels. When data were stratified by SES (low, medium, and high), only infants with low and medium SES presented a significant increase in risk of all-cause mortality and respiratory mortality in relation to PM(10). O(3) was only significantly related to respiratory mortality in low SES.

CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that in the Mexico City Metropolitan Area, infants with lower SES (low to medium) are at higher risk of mortality when exposed to ambient PM(10) and O(3)."

DESIGN: Daily counts of total and respiratory death along with daily levels of meteorological variables and air pollutants were analyzed using generalized additive Poisson regression. The relative risks (RR) of mortality for interquartile changes of the levels of particulate matter <10 micro m (PM(10)) were calculated on the same day.

Population-based, cross-sectional studies of metropolitan areas in the United States have also found associations between particulate air pollution and annual mortality rates, but these studies have been criticized, in part because they did not directly control for cigarette smoking and other health risks.

Methods: In this prospective cohort study, we estimated the effects of air pollution on mortality, while controlling for individual risk factors. Survival analysis, including Cox proportional-hazards regression modeling, was conducted with data from a 14-to-16-year mortality follow-up of 8111 adults in six U.S. cities.

Results: Mortality rates were most strongly associated with cigarette smoking. After adjusting for smoking and other risk factors, we observed statistically significant and robust associations between air pollution and mortality. The adjusted mortality-rate ratio for the most polluted of the cities as compared with the least polluted was 1.26 (95 percent confidence interval, 1.08 to 1.47). Air pollution was positively associated with death from lung cancer and cardiopulmonary disease but not with death from other causes considered together. Mortality was most strongly associated with air pollution with fine particulates, including sulfates.

Conclusions: Although the effects of other, unmeasured risk factors cannot be excluded with certainty, these results suggest that fine-particulate air pollution, or a more complex pollution mixture associated with fine particulate matter, contributes to excess mortality in certain U.S. cities."

There is a lack of chronic exposure studies in developing countries. Air pollution in Brazil has a particular characteristic because of the extensive use of alcohol alone or associated with gasoline. The present study indicates the potential effect of air pollutants, and mainly of ozone, on cancer incidence. Complementary studies are mandatory to provide a wide perspective of that association in developing countries."

Subgroups in each test group received a single ip injection of 1,000 mg urethan/kg or 0.9% sodium chloride vehicle 1 day prior to initiation of the exposure regimen. Tumor incidence in Swiss Webster mice was 0-3% in groups not receiving urethan and was 61-74% in groups receiving urethan. In A/J mice, the corresponding values were 9-38% and 100%, respectively. Exposure to ozone caused a decrease in the number of tumors per lung in urethan-treated mice of both strains, in a dose-dependent manner. There seemed to be a specific decrease in tumors derived from alveolar type II cells in the A/J mice given urethan plus ozone. Most interesting, perhaps, was a significant increase in the number of tumors per lung in A/J mice exposed to 0.8 ppm ozone without urethan, confirming a previous report by others. The corresponding ozone effect on lung tumor development was not observed in Swiss Webster mice."

In separate experiments, animals were exposed to two concentrations of ozone (0.31 +/- 0.01 and 0.50 +/- 0.02 ppm) intermittently for a 6-month period, to evaluate the potential of ozone to act as either a pulmonary carcinogen, a tumor promoter, or an inhalant capable of increasing lung tumor yield when exposure was in conjunction with a pulmonary carcinogen, urethane. Statistical analyses of results indicated that ozone exposure at both concentrations caused an increase in lung tumor number relative to clean air controls, but that ozone was not an effective tumor promoter under the conditions of our protocol. When ozone exposure immediately preceded treatment with urethane (CAS: 51-79-6), animals were at increased risk for the development of lung adenomas."

To test the hypothesis, female strain A/J mice were exposed for 6 h/day, 5 days/week to 0.12 ppm, 0.5 ppm, or 1.0 ppm of ozone; control animals were kept in filtered air. No ozone-related deaths were observed at any time during the experiment. After 5 months, one-third of the animals were killed. The remaining animals were split into two groups: exposure to ozone continued for one group, whereas the other group was transferred into filtered air. Four months later, these animals were killed. No significant increase in lung tumor multiplicity (average number of tumors per lung) or lung tumor incidence (percentage of tumor-bearing animals) was found in the animals exposed to ozone when compared to animals kept in filtered air, regardless of ozone concentration. Morphometric analysis of lungs of animals exposed to the highest ozone concentration (1.0 ppm) showed a small, statistically not significant increase in centriacinar lesions. It was concluded that ozone is not a lung carcinogen in strain A/J mice at those exposure levels. Moreover, this mouse strain appears to be particularly resistant towards chronic ozone toxicity."

As a general rule, preexposure to the oxidant, before administration of a carcinogen, or exposure to high levels for a comparatively short time immediately following carcinogen administration favors development of tumors. On the other hand, prolonged exposure begun after a certain time following carcinogen exposure inhibits tumor development. The paradoxical effects of the two oxidants depend on experimental design; results can be tentatively explained in terms of oxidant-induced cell proliferation or by oxidant-mediated cytotoxicity. Besides being capable of modifying chemically induced lung tumorigenesis, ozone and oxygen also appear to induce tumors in mouse lung on their own. The conclusions drawn from the study of mouse lung tumors have recently been reinforced in experiments with hamsters, where hyperoxia has clear tumor-modulating effects."

Fischer-344/N (F-344/N) rats were exposed 6 hr/day, 5 days/wk, to 0, 0.12, 0.5,or 1.0 ppm ozone by inhalation for 2-yr and lifetime exposures. The cocarcinogenicity study included subcutaneous administration of 0, 0.1, or 1.0 mg/kg body weight of 4-(N-nitrosomethylamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone (NNK) and inhalation of 0 or 0.5 ppm ozone to male rats. NNK was administered by subcutaneous injections 3 times per week for the first 20 wk with ozone inhalation exposure. The ozone inhalation exposure was for 2 yr (104 wk), including the first 20 wk of NNK treatment and continuing for 84 wk after the last NNK injection. Ozone exposure caused a concentration-related increase in inflammation of the centriacinar region of the lung. There was also increased fibrosis and an extension of the bronchiolar epithelium in these centriacinar regions to involve the proximal alveoli. There was no increased incidence of neoplasms at any site, including the lung, that was associated with ozone exposure. Rats administered 1.0 mg/kg body weight NNK alone had an increased incidence of bronchiolar/alveolar neoplasms, but this effect was not enhanced by ozone exposure. Ozone exposure for 2 yr and lifetime was associated with site-specific toxic alterations in the nasal passage and lung similar to those previously described for short-term exposures. While there was significant attenuation of the pulmonary lesions as compared to short-term exposures, lesions persisted in the lifetime study and there was evidence of a mild progressive fibrosis. We conclude that under the conditions of these studies: (a) ozone exposure is not carcinogenic to either male or female F-344/N rats,(b) ozone does not enhance the incidence of pulmonary neoplasms in F-344/N rats exposed to a known pulmonary carcinogen (NNK), and (c) mild site-specific toxic lesions characteristic of ozone exposure persist in the nasal passage and lung throughout the lifetime of the rat with continued ozone exposure."

After 6 months, no more DEN injections were given and all animals were kept in air until termination of the experiment at 7 months. It was found that the animals kept in ozone developed half as many peripheral lung tumors as did the animals kept in air; however, the difference was not statistically significant. Tumors of the trachea, bronchi, nasal cavity and liver developed with the same incidence whether the animals were exposed to ozone or not. It was concluded that ozone, an agent known to produce cell proliferation in the respiratory tract, does not enhance the development of tumors in the peripheral lung or in the nasal cavity of hamsters."

No tumor incidence was found in mice of either gender exposed to ozone alone. Pulmonary neoplasms were found in both, male and female mice exposed to NNK alone and in combination, ozone with NNK only or NNK plus DBP. Oviductal carcinomas were observed in females exposed to DBP alone and together with ozone plus NNK.

Ozone (O3), the major oxidant of photochemical smog, is thought to be genotoxic and a potential respiratory carcinogen or promoter of carcinogenic processes. Because of oxidative reactions with the mucus in the upper airway, O3 reaction product are able to penetrate into the tracheobronchial epithelial (TE) cells. The carcinogenic effects of O3 on the TE cells are especially of interest since most previous studies have focused on the morphology or permeability changes of tracheas only. Therefore, the objective of this study was to examine the potential O3 genotoxicity in TE cells after an in vivo exposure, using DNA strand breaks as an index. Two-month-old male Dunkin-Hartley guinea pigs, specific pathogen free, 4 in each group, were exposed to 1.0 ppm O3 for 0, 12, 24, 48, 72, or 96 h. Animals exposed to filtered air without O3 exposure were used as controls. After O3 exposure, the trachea with two main bronchi was removed from each animal, and TE cells were isolated and employed for determination of DNA strand breaks by fluorometric analysis of DNA unwinding (FADU). The statistical significance level was set at a .05. Compared with controls, ozone exposure did not alter the TE cell yield or viability, but caused an increase in protein content in tracheal lavage and an increase in DNA strand breaks. The amount of DNA left in the alkali lysate of TE cells found at 72 h exposure was significantly decreased from controls for 3 different alkali incubation times. An increase of the double-stranded DNA left in the alkali lysate of TE cells was observed at 96 h of exposure and approached the value of 24 h of exposure. The same pattern was seen with all 3 different alkali incubation times at 15 degrees C. One Qd unit was estimated to correspond to 100 strand breaks per cell. The Qd was also used as an indicator for O3 damage. Compared to controls, the Qd increases significantly after 1 ppm O3 exposure for 72 h, regardless of the alkali incubation time at 15 degrees C."

Although ozone is suspected to be a respiratory carcinogen it is not regulated as a carcinogen in most countries. The genotoxic and inflammatory effects of ozone were investigated in female mice exposed to ozone for 90 min. The tail moment in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) cells from BALB/c mice was determined by the comet assay as a measure of DNA strand breaks. Within the first 200 min after exposure, the BAL cells from the mice exposed to 1 or 2 ppm ozone had 1.6- and 2.6-fold greater tail moments than unexposed mice. After 200 min there was no effect. It could be ruled out that the effect during the first 200 min was due to major infiltration of lymphocytes or neutrophils. Unexpectedly, ozone had no effect on the content of 8-oxo-deoxyguanosine (8-oxo-dG) in nuclear DNA or on oxidised amino acids in the lung tissue. The mRNA level of the repair enzyme ERCC1 was not increased in the lung tissue. Inflammation was measured by the cytokine mRNA level in lung homogenates. An up to 150-fold induction of interleukin-6 (IL-6) mRNA was detected in the animals exposed to 2 ppm ozone compared to the air-exposed control mice. Also at 1 ppm ozone, the IL-6 mRNA was induced. The large induction of IL-6 mRNA in the lung took place after DNA strand breaks were induced in BAL. This does not support the notion that inflammatory reactions are the cause of DNA damage. To determine whether these exposures were mutagenic, Muta(TM)Mice were exposed to 2 ppm ozone, 90 min per day for 5 days. No treatment-related mutations could be detected in the cII transgene. These results indicate that a short episode of ozone exposure at five times the threshold limit value (TLV) in US induces lung inflammatory mediators and DNA damage in the cells in the lumen of the lung. This was not reflected by an induction of mutations in the lung of Muta(TM)Mice."

In this study, we used geographic information systems (GISs) to explore possible associations between chromosomal damage in 65 African American children and their mothers from Oakland, California, and both proximity to traffic and regional ozone levels. Study participants were interviewed at the Healthy Child Clinic of Children's Hospital, Oakland, and their blood and buccal cells were collected for assessment of chromosomal damage by the micronucleus (MN) assay. Regional ozone levels, which decreased from April to November with a secondary peak in late summer, were highly correlated with season by month (r = -0.84, P = 0.02) and strongly associated with MN frequency (frequency ratio (FR): 3.37, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.30-8.72) in both cell types of children and adults. Additionally, MN frequencies were modestly associated with individual measures of traffic density in children (FR = 2.45, 95% CI= 0.86-7.10), but not in adults; this suggests a greater vulnerability to traffic-related air pollution in children. Smoking in the household also increased MN frequency in the lymphocytes of children (FR: 1.13, 95%CI: 1.01-1.24) and adults (FR: 1.06, 95%CI: 0.99-1.13), whereas vitamin use in adults decreased MN frequency in both lymphocytes and buccal cells (FR: 0.17, 95%CI: 0.02-1.31; FR: 0.18, 95%CI: 0.03-1.18, respectively).

AIMS: To investigate the association between personal exposure to a group of air pollutants and severity of DNA damage in outdoor workers from two Mexican cities. METHODS: DNA damage (Comet assay) and personal exposure to volatile organic compounds, PM(2.5), and ozone were investigated in 55 outdoor and indoor workers from MUxico City and Puebla. RESULTS: In MUxico City, outdoor workers had greater DNA damage, reflected by a longer tail length, than indoor workers (median 46.8 v 30.1 mum), and a greater percentage of highly damaged cells (cells with tail length > or =41 microm); in Puebla, outdoor and indoor workers had similar DNA damage. There were more alkali labile sites in outdoor than indoor workers. The DNA damage magnitude was positively correlated with PM(2.5) and ozone exposure. Outdoor and indoor workers with > or =60% of highly damaged cells (highly damaged workers) had significantly higher exposures to PM(2.5), ozone, and some volatile organic compounds. The main factors associated with the highly damaged workers were ozone, PM(2.5), and 1-ethyl-2-methyl benzene exposure. CONCLUSIONS: With this approach, the effects of some air pollutants could be correlated with biological endpoints from the Comet assay. It is suggested that the use of personal exposure assessment and biological endpoints evaluation could be an important tool to generate a more precise assessment of the associated potential health risks."

Three controls per case were matched for questionnaire analyses and two controls per case for laboratory analyses. Matching criteria were gender, age, smoking status, country of recruitment, and follow-up time. Individual exposure to air pollution was assessed using concentration data from monitoring stations in routine air quality monitoring networks. Leukocyte DNA adducts were analyzed blindly using 32P postlabeling technique. Adducts were associated with the subsequent risk of lung cancer, with an odds ratio (OR) of 1.86 [95% confidence interval (95% CI), 0.88-3.93] when comparing detectable versus nondetectable adducts. The association with lung cancer was stronger in never-smokers (OR, 4.04; 95% CI, 1.06-15.42) and among the younger age groups. After exclusion of the cancers occurring in the first 36 months of follow-up, the OR was 4.16 (95% CI, 1.24-13.88). A positive association was found between DNA adducts and ozone (O3) concentration.

Overall, statistically significant positive correlations between average ozone concentrations and DNA damage emerged in almost all time-windows considered; correlations were more evident among males, non-smokers, and traffic-exposed workers. Multivariate regression analyses taking into account selected individual characteristics, showed an independent effect on DNA damage of average ozone concentrations in the last 60-90days before blood drawing.

This article addresses the importance of blood pressure as a covariate in studies of long-term associations between air quality and mortality. We focus on a cohort of about 50,000 U.S. veterans who had been diagnosed as hypertensive at some time and whose survival rates were predicted by blood pressure (BP) and ambient air quality, among other factors. The relationship between BP and air quality is considered by reviewing the literature, by deleting variables from the proportional hazards regression model, and by stratifying the cohort by diastolic blood pressure (DBP) level. The literature review shows BP to be an important predictor of survival and finds small transient associations between air quality and BP that may be either positive or negative. The regression model sensitivity runs showed that the associations with air pollution are robust to the deletion of the BP variables, for the entire cohort. For stratified regressions, the confidence intervals for the air pollution-mortality associations overlap for the two DBP groups. We conclude that associations between mortality and air quality are not mediated through blood pressure, nor vice versa."

This paper presents the design of and some results from a new prospective mortality study of a national cohort of about 50,000 U.S. veterans who were diagnosed as hypertensive in the mid-1970s, based on approximately 21 years of follow-up. This national cohort is male with an average age at recruitment of 51 +/- 12 y; 35% were black and 81% had been smokers at one time. Because the subjects have been receiving care at various U.S. Veterans Administration (VA) hospitals, access to and quality of medical care are relatively homogeneous. The health endpoints available for analysis include all-cause mortality and specific diagnoses for morbidity during VA hospitalizations; only the mortality results are discussed here. Non-pollution predictor variables in the baseline model include race, smoking (ever or at recruitment), age, systolic and diastolic blood pressure (BP), and body mass index (BMI). Interactions of BP and BMI with age were also considered. Although this study essentially controls for socioeconomic status by design because of the homogeneity of the cohort, selected ecological variables were also considered at the zip code and county levels, some of which were found to be significant predictors. Pollutants were averaged by year and county for TSP, PM10, CO, O3, and NO2; SO2 and Pb were considered less thoroughly. Both mean and peak levels were considered for gases. SO42- data from the AIRS database and PM2.5, coarse particles, PM15, and SO42- from EPA's Inhalable Particulate (IP) Network were also considered. Four relevant exposure periods were defined: 1974 and earlier (back to 1953 for TSP), 1975-81, 1982-88, and 1989-96. Deaths during each of the three most recent exposure periods were considered separately, yielding up to 12 combinations of exposure and mortality periods for each pollutant. Associations between concurrent air quality and mortality periods were considered to relate to acute responses; delayed associations with prior exposures were considered to be emblematic of initiation of chronic disease. Pre-exposure mortality associations were considered to be indirect (non-causal). The implied mortality risks of long-term exposure to air pollution were found to be sensitive to the details of the regression model, the time period of exposure, the locations included and to the inclusion of ecological as well as personal variables. Both positive and negative statistically significant mortality responses were found. Fine particles as measured in the 1979-84 EPA Inhalable Particulate Network indicated no significant (positive) excess mortality risk for this cohort in any of the models considered. Among the positive responses, indications of concurrent mortality risks were seen for NO2 and peak O3 with a similar indication of delayed risks only for NO2. The mean levels of these excess risks were in the range of 5-9%. Peak O3 was dominant in 2-pollutant models and there was some indication of a threshold in response. However, it is likely that standard errors of the regression coefficients may have been underestimated because of spatial autocorrelation among the model residuals. The significant variability of responses by period of death cohort suggests that aggregation over the entire period of follow-up obscures important aspects of the implied pollution-mortality relationships, such as early depletion of the available pool of those subjects who may be most susceptible to air pollution effects."

The analysis used county-level environmental data for the period 1997-2002 and cohort mortality for 1997-2001. The proportional hazards model included individual data on age, race, smoking, body mass index, height, blood pressure, and selected interactions; contextual variables also controlled for climate, education, and income. In single-pollutant models, traffic density appears to be the most important predictor of survival, but potential contributions are also seen for NO2, NO3-, elemental carbon, nickel, and vanadium. The effects of the other main constituents of PM2.5, of crustal particles, and of peak levels of CO, O3, or SO2 appear to be less important. Traffic density is also consistently the most important environmental predictor in multiple-pollutant models, with combined relative risks up to about 1.2. However, from these findings it is not possible to discern which aspects of traffic (pollution, noise, stress) may be the most relevant to public health or whether an area-based predictor such as traffic density may have an inherent advantage over localized measures of ambient air quality. It is also possible that traffic density could be a marker for unmeasured pollutants or for geographic gradients per se. Pending resolution of these issues, including replication in other cohorts, it will be difficult to formulate additional cost-effective pollution control strategies that are likely to benefit public health."

The generalized estimating equations model was used to investigate the impact of nitrogen dioxide (NO2), ozone (O3) and sulphur dioxide (SO2) on mortality due to cardio-respiratory disease after adjusting for a range of potential confounders. An increase of 4.7% (95% confidence interval = 0.7-8.9%) in cardio-respiratory mortality for 1 part per billion (ppb) increment in annual average concentration of SO2 was estimated. However, there was no significant association between long-term exposures to NO2 or O3 and death due to cardio-respiratory disease.

DESIGN: We investigated whether PM was associated with progression of disease or reduced survival in a study of 196,000 persons from 21 U.S. cities discharged alive following an acute myocardial infarction (MI), using within-city between-year exposure to PM. We constructed city-specific cohorts of survivors of acute MI using Medicare data between 1985 and 1999, and defined three outcomes on follow-up: death, subsequent MI, and a first admission for congestive heart failure (CHF). Yearly averages of PM(10) (particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter < 10 microm) were merged to the individual annual follow-up in each city. We applied Cox's proportional hazard regression model in each city, with adjustment for individual risk factors. In the second stage of the analysis, the city-specific results were combined using a meta-regression. RESULTS: We found significant associations with a hazard ratio for the sum of the distributed lags of 1.3 [95% confidence interval (CI), 1.2-1.5] for mortality, a hazard ratio of 1.4 (95% CI, 1.2-1.7) for a hospitalization for CHF, and a hazard ratio of 1.4 (95% CI, 1.1-1.8) for a new hospitalization for MI per 10 microg/m(3) PM(10).

We undertook new meta-analyses of existing time-series studies and an analysis of a cohort of 352[punctuation space]000 people in 66 US cities during 18 years of follow-up. This cohort study provides estimates of mortality effects from long-term exposure to elemental carbon, an indicator of black carbon mass, and evidence that ozone exerts an independent risk of mortality. Associations among these pollutants make drawing conclusions about their individual health effects difficult at present, but sulphate seems to have the most robust effects in multiple-pollutant models. Generally, the toxicology of the pure compounds and their epidemiology diverge because atmospheric black carbon, ozone, and sulphate are associated and could interact with related toxic species. Although sulphate is a cooling agent, black carbon and ozone could together exert nearly half as much global warming as carbon dioxide. The complexity of these health and climate effects needs to be recognised in mitigation policies."

Additionally, we formulate a definition of susceptibility building from the varied and inconsistent definitions of susceptibility and vulnerability used throughout the literature. Data Synthesis: We evaluated recent epidemiologic studies to identify characteristics of populations potentially susceptible to PM-related health effects. Controlled human exposure and toxicological studies were evaluated to provide supporting evidence. A comprehensive review was conducted of epidemiologic studies that presented stratified results (e.g., <65 vs. ?65 years old), controlled human exposure studies that examined individuals with underlying disease, and toxicological studies that used animal models of disease. Results were evaluated for consistency across studies, coherence across disciplines, and biological plausibility to assess the potential for increased susceptibility to PM-related health effects in a specific population or lifestage. Conclusions: We identified a diverse group of characteristics that can lead to increased risk of PM-related health effects including lifestage (i.e., children and older adults), preexisting cardiovascular or respiratory diseases, genetic polymorphisms, and low socioeconomic status. In addition, we crafted a comprehensive definition of susceptibility that can be used to encompass all populations potentially at increased risk of adverse health effects as a consequence of exposure to an air pollutant."

This is associated with an accumulation of activated macrophages in the lower lung, which we have demonstrated contribute to tissue injury. Nitric oxide (NO) is a highly reactive cytotoxic macrophage-derived mediator that has been implicated in lung damage. In the present studies we used knockout mice with a targeted disruption of the gene for inducible nitric oxide synthase (NOSII) to analyze the role of NO in ozone-induced lung inflammation and tissue injury. Treatment of wild-type control mice with ozone (0.8 ppm) for 3 h resulted in a time-dependent increase in protein and cells in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, which reached a maximum 24-48 h after exposure. Alveolar macrophages isolated from animals treated with ozone were found to produce increased amounts of NO, as well as peroxynitrite. This was correlated with induction of NOSII protein and nitrotyrosine staining of lung macrophages in tissue sections and in culture. Production of superoxide anion and prostaglandin (PG)E2 by alveolar macrophages was also increased after ozone inhalation. In contrast, alveolar macrophages from NOSII knockout mice did not produce reactive nitrogen intermediates even after ozone inhalation. Moreover, production of PGE2 was at control levels. NOSII knockout mice were also protected from ozone-induced inflammation and tissue injury, as measured by bronchoalveolar lavage protein and cell number. There was also no evidence of peroxynitrite-mediated lung damage in these animals. Taken together, these data demonstrate that NO, produced via NOSII, and potentially, its reactive oxidative product peroxynitrite, play a critical role in ozone-induced release of inflammatory mediators and in tissue injury."

Ozone exposure caused acute edema and an inflammatory response in the lungs of wild-type mice, as indicated by significant increases in lavage protein content, MIP-2 and MMP-9 content, and polymorphonuclear leukocytes. The iNOS knockout mice showed significantly greater levels of lung injury by all of these criteria than did the wild-type mice.

Mice were exposed to 0.8 parts/million ozone for 8 h, and we examined a wide range of biological parameters in the lung at the gene expression, protein, and cellular level 4 h after the ozone exposure. Relevant biological responses to ozone for both repair-deficient Csb(-/-) and repair-proficient Csb(+/-) mice, as determined by biochemical analysis of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (e.g., increases of polymorphonuclear neutrophils, alkaline phosphatase, macrophage-inflammatory protein-2, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha), pathological examinations, and gene expression (upregulation of oxidative-stress-related genes) analyses were observed. The bronchoalveolar lavage fluid showed significantly more tumor necrosis factor-alpha in repair-deficient Csb(-/-) mice than in repair-proficient Csb(+/-) mice after ozone exposure. In addition, a clear trend was observed toward fewer differentially expressed genes with a lower fold ratio in repair-deficient Csb(-/-) mice than in repair-proficient Csb(+/-) mice. However, repair-deficient Csb(-/-) mice do not respond significantly more sensitively to ozone compared with repair-proficient Csb(+/-) mice at the level of gene expression.

The proportion of monocytes and neutrophils recovered by bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) as well as the level of total protein in BAL fluid were significantly increased in both IL-6 KO and WT mice following exposure to ozone or to ADSS/ozone. However, bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) labeling within terminal bronchiolar epithelium and proximal alveolar regions in IL-6 KO mice exposed to ozone or to ADSS/ozone was significantly reduced compared with IL-6 sufficient mice (WT). WT mice treated with IL-6 antibodies also demonstrated a reduction in BrdU cell labeling similar to that observed in IL-6 KO mice following exposure to ozone or ADSS/ozone. Clara cell secretory protein (CCSP) abundance, a marker of Clara cell maturation and function, was markedly reduced in the terminal bronchiolar epithelium of WT mice following exposure to ADSS and/or ozone, whereas CCSP abundance was unchanged in IL-6 KO mice. We conclude that endogenous IL-6 in mice plays a critical role in the progress of lung inflammation/injury, but CCSP may also play a role to protect the lungs of mice exposed to toxic air pollutants. Data from this study further suggest that IL-6 antibody treatment modalities may be a means to attenuate pulmonary inflammation and injury."

The present study explores the molecular bases for this differential O(3) susceptibility by studying the expression of proteins associated to the epithelial lining fluid (ELF) from two strains of mice, C57BL/6J and the C3H/HeJ, respectively described as O(3)-sensitive and O(3)-resistant. The ELF proteins of these two strains were displayed by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DE) of bronchoalveolar lavage fluids (BALFs) and the protein patterns obtained with BALF samples of both strains were compared. Two major differences were observed between the BALF 2-DE protein maps obtained from C57BL/6J and C3H/HeJ strains. First, two isoforms of the antioxidant protein 2 (AOP2) were detected in a strain-dependent manner: C3J/HeJ possesses only AOP2a (isoelectric point 5.7) and C57BL/6J exhibits only AOP2b (isoelectric point 6.0). Second, the levels of anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive Clara cell protein-16 (CC16) were 1.3 times higher in the BALF from resistant C3H/HeJ than from sensitive C57BL/6 mice. Moreover, two 6 kDa isoforms of CC16 with isoelectric points of 4.9 (CC16a) and 5.2 (CC16b) are detected in both strains. Interestingly, the C57BL/6J strain had a twice decreased level of the acidic isoform of CC16 compared to C3H/HeJ. Our results suggest that AOP2 and CC16 might participate in the protection of the pulmonary tract to O(3)-induced lung injury.

To simulate a repeated, episodic exposure to air pollutants, wild-type and TNF mice inhaled air or a mixture of ozone (0.4 ppm) and urban particles (EHC-93, 4.8 mg/m3) for 4 h, once per week, for 12 consecutive weeks and were sacrificed 20 h after last exposure. TNF mice exhibited chronic lung inflammation with septal thickening, alveolar enlargement, and elevated protein and cellularity in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (genotype main effect, p < .001). Repeated exposure to pollutants did not result in measurable inflammatory changes in wild-type mice and did not exacerbate the inflammation in TNF mice. The pollutants decreased recovery of alveolar macrophages in tavage fluid of both wild-type and TNF mice (exposure main effect, p < .001). Exacerbation of the rate of protein nitration reactions specifically in the lungs of TNF mice was revealed by the high ratio of 3-nitrotyrosine to L-DOPA after exposure to the air pollutants (Genotype x Exposure factor interaction, p = .014). Serum creatine kinase-MM isoform increased in TNF mice exposed to pollutants (Genotype X Exposure factor interaction, p = .043). The marked pollutant-related nitration in the lungs of the TNF mice reveals basic differences in free radical generation and scavenging in the inflamed lungs in response to pollutants.

OA-sensitized mice and saline-treated control mice were exposed to 1.0 ppm ozone or clean air for 6 h daily and five days weekly for five weeks. Subsequently, these mice were exposed to 1.0 ppm ozone for 1 h, and pulmonary function was evaluated by pneumotachography during ozone exposure and arterial blood gas analysis and histopathological examination were performed. OA sensitization or repeated ozone exposure did not affect baseline pulmonary function. In OA-sensitized mice receiving repeated ozone exposure, acute ozone exposure increased respiratory resistance and decreased dynamic compliance, with significant differences in both parameters compared with, after repeated ozone exposure without OA sensitization. In mice without repeated exposure, there was no difference in the effect of acute ozone exposure according to the use of OA sensitization. After 1-h exposure, arterial blood gas analysis showed a significant decrease in PaO2 in mice undergoing OA sensitization alone, with no significant reduction of this parameter in mice receiving repeated exposure. Histopathologically, alveolar epithelial hyperplasia occurred in repeatedly exposed mice. These results indicated that respiratory allergy might be a risk factor, which aggravates the effects of repeated ozone exposure."

We carried out this mortality time series study in Montreal, Quebec, Canada to confirm these observations and to determine whether diabetics who had other health conditions were also at higher risk of dying when air pollution increases. METHODS AND RESULTS: In one analysis, we related daily deaths from diabetes (using the underlying cause) to daily concentrations of particles and gaseous pollutants. In another analysis, we created subgroups by identifying subjects diagnosed 1 year before death with diabetes and other major health conditions from billing and prescription data from the universal Quebec Health Insurance Plan. The analysis made use of parametric log-linear Poisson models that were adjusted for long-term temporal trends and daily weather conditions. We found positive associations between most air pollutants and daily mortality from diabetes as well as among subjects diagnosed with diabetes 1 year before death. In the latter group of subjects, greater effects were found generally in the warm season and especially among subjects who had diabetes and who also had any cardiovascular disease, chronic coronary disease, and atherosclerosis. We did not find evidence of associations among persons who only had diabetes (i.e., did not also have cancer, cardiovascular disease, or lower respiratory disease). CONCLUSIONS: These data indicate that individuals with diabetes who also have cardiovascular disease may be susceptible to the short-term effects of air pollution."

This observation raised the possibility that pulmonary damage from other oxidant substances might be greater in a hyperthyroid state. To address this hypothesis, pulmonary responses to crystalline silica, a particulate with oxidant properties, were evaluated in normal or hyperthyroid adult male rats. To induce a hyperthyroid condition, time-release pellets containing thyroxine were implanted subcutaneously; control rats received placebo pellets. After 7 days, the animals were exposed to saline or silica (0.1mg/100g BW or 1.0mg/100g BW) by intratracheal instillation. Following silica treatment, there was a dose-related increase in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) albumin levels and neutrophil numbers. However, the effects of silica were similar in both normal and hyperthyroid rats. These findings were confirmed and contrasted with those regarding ozone (1ppm, 4h inhalation) in a subsequent experiment. The results indicated that, although exposure to either ozone or silica resulted in increases in BAL albumin levels and neutrophil numbers, only responses to ozone were enhanced in hyperthyroid rats. These findings suggest that specificity exists in regards to the modulation of oxidant-induced lung damage and inflammation by thyroid hormones."

METHODS: This is a retrospective ecological study. Data of daily emergency hospital admissions to 15 major hospitals in HK for asthma and indices of air pollutants [sulphur dioxide (SO(2)), nitrogen dioxide (NO(2)), ozone (O(3)), particulates with an aerodynamic diameter of <10 microm particulate matter (PM(10)) and 2.5 microm (PM(2.5))] and meteorological variables from January 2000 to December 2005 were obtained from several government departments. Analysis was performed by the generalized additive models with Poisson distribution. The effects of time trend, season, other cyclical factors, temperature and humidity were adjusted. Autocorrelation and overdispersion were corrected. RESULTS: Altogether, 69 716 admissions were assessed. Significant associations were found between hospital admissions for asthma and levels of NO(2), O(3), PM(10) and PM(2.5). The relative risks (RR) for hospitalization for every 10 microg/m(3) increase in NO(2), O(3), PM(10) and PM(2.5) were 1.028, 1.034, 1.019 and 1.021, respectively, at a lag day that ranged from cumulative lag 0-4 to 0-5. In a multi-pollutant model, O(3) was significantly associated with increased admissions for asthma. The younger age group (0-14 years) tended to have a higher RR for each 10 microg/m(3) increase in pollutants than those aged 15-65 years. The elderly (aged >/=65 years) had a shorter 'best' lag time to develop asthma exacerbation following exposure to pollutants than those aged <65 years. CONCLUSION: Adverse effects of ambient concentrations of air pollutants on hospitalization rates for asthma are evident. Measures to improve air quality in HK are urgently needed."

natural progression is to consider tracking the ?link? itself, that
is, to track the association between an environmental hazard and

association was positive in the first 3 years and negative in the

associations between ambient air quality and acute morbidity is
not generalizable to most other EPHT topic areas, but there are
ample reasons to pursue this activity. The analysis can potentially

Scavenger receptor B1 (SRB1), one of a large family of scavenger receptors, has been shown to facilitate AT transfer from HDL to peripheral tissues via apo A-1-mediated processes and to be important in the delivery of AT to the lung cells. In the present studies the effects of age and two environmental oxidants ozone (O(3)) (0.25 ppm 6 h/day) and cigarette smoke (CS) (60 mg/m(3) 6 h/day) for 4 days on selected aspects of AT transport in murine lung tissues were assessed. While AT levels were 25% higher (p<0.05) and 15% lower (p<0.05) in plasma and lung tissue, respectively, in aged versus young mice, acute environmental exposure to O(3) or CS at the doses used had no effect. Gene expression levels, determined by RT-PCR of AT transport protein (ATTP), SRB1, CD36, ATP binding cassette 3 (ABCA3) and ABCA1 and protein levels, determined by Western blots for SRB1, ATTP and ABCA1 were assessed. Aged mouse lung showed a lower levels of ATTP, ABCA3 and SRB1 and a higher level CD36 and ABCA1. Acute exposure to either O(3) or CS induced declines in ATTP and SRB1 in both aged and young mice lung. CD36 increased in both young and aged mice lung upon exposure to O(3) and CS. These findings suggest that both age and environmental oxidant exposure affect pathways related to lung AT homeostasis and do so in a way that favors declines in lung AT. However, given the approach taken, the effects cannot be traced to changes in these pathways or AT content in any specific lung associated cell type and thus highlight the need for further follow-up studies looking at specific lung associated cell types."

The objective of the present study was to determine the influence of relatively high concentrations of air pollution on mortality in a general population sample and in the very elderly. 
Study design: Daily time-series analyses tested the association between daily air pollution and daily mortality in seven Chilean urban centers during 1997-2003. Results were adjusted for day of the week and humidex. 
Results: Daily averaged particulate matter with aerodynamic matter < 10 Am (PM10) was 84.88 Ag/m3, sulfur dioxide was 14.08ppb, and carbon monoxide was 1.29 ppb. The 1-hr maximum ozone was 100.13 ppb.

Prior findings about modifiers are inconsistent, and most of these studies were conducted in developed countries. OBJECTIVES: We conducted a time-series analysis to examine the modifying effect of season, sex, age, and education on the association between outdoor air pollutants [particulate matter < 10 microm in aerodynamic diameter (PM(10)), sulfur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide, and ozone] and daily mortality in Shanghai, China, using 4 years of daily data (2001-2004). METHODS: Using a natural spline model to analyze the data, we examined effects of air pollution for the warm season (April-September) and cool season (October-March) separately. For total mortality, we examined the association stratified by sex and age. Stratified analysis by educational attainment was conducted for total, cardiovascular, and respiratory mortality. RESULTS: Outdoor air pollution was associated with mortality from all causes and from cardiorespiratory diseases in Shanghai. An increase of 10 mug/m(3) in a 2-day average concentration of PM(10), SO(2), NO(2), and O(3) corresponds to increases in all-cause mortality of 0.25% [95% confidence interval (CI), 0.14-0.37), 0.95% (95% CI, 0.62-1.28), 0.97% (95% CI, 0.66-1.27), and 0.31% (95% CI, 0.04-0.58), respectively. The effects of air pollutants were more evident in the cool season than in the warm season, and females and the elderly were more vulnerable to outdoor air pollution. Effects of air pollution were generally greater in residents with low educational attainment (illiterate or primary school) compared with those with high educational attainment (middle school or above). CONCLUSIONS: Season, sex, age, and education may modify the health effects of outdoor air pollution in Shanghai.

A case-crossover design was used to calculate odds ratios for the hospitalization adjusted for daily weather conditions with an incremented exposure corresponding to the interquartile range in air pollution exposures. 
Results.When particulate matter and gaseous pollutants were mutually taken into account, the effect remained pronounced for PM10-2.5 in both boys and girls. The adjusted odds ratio for 6-day average exposure to PM10-2.5 with an increment of 6.5 Ag/m3 was 1.15 (95% confidence interval: 1.02-1.30) for boys and 1.18 (95% confidence interval: 1.01-1.36) for girls. The effect also remained for PM10 in boys and for NO2 in girls. PM2.5, CO, SO2, and O3 showed no significant effects on hospitalization for respiratory infection in both genders when other pollutants were taken into consideration.

OBJECTIVES: We set out to examine whether people residing in socially deprived communities are at higher mortality risk from ambient air pollution.

METHODS: This study included 209 tertiary planning units (TPUs), the smallest units for town planning in the Special Administrative Region of Hong Kong, China. The socioeconomic status of each TPU was measured by a social deprivation index (SDI) derived from the proportions of the population with a) unemployment, b) monthly household income < US$250, c) no schooling at all, d) one-person household, e) never-married status, and f ) subtenancy, from the 2001 Population Census. TPUs were classified into three levels of SDI: low, middle, and high. We performed time-series analysis with Poisson regression to examine the association between changes in daily concentrations of ambient air pollution and daily number of deaths in each SDI group for the period from January 1996 to December 2002. We evaluated the differences in pollution effects between different SDI groups using a case-only approach with logistic regression.

RESULTS: We found significant associations of nitrogen dioxide, sulfur dioxide, particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter < 10 mum, and ozone with all nonaccidental and cardiovascular mortality in areas of middle or high SDI (p < 0.05). Health outcomes, measured as all nonaccidental, cardiovascular, and respiratory mortality, in people residing in high SDI areas were more strongly associated with SO(2) and NO(2) compared with those in middle or low SDI areas.

Significant interactive effects of O3 and CO2 on the gas exchange of all three species were limited. The effects of elevated CO2 and O3, singly and combined, on light-saturated net photosynthesis (Amax) and stomatal conductance (gs) were inconsistent across species. In all three species, elevated O3 had no effect on gs. Elevated CO2 significantly increased Amax in GA and YP foliage, and decreased gs in YP foliage. Maximum carbon exchange rates and quantum efficiencies derived from light-response curves increased, while compensation irradiance and dark respiration decreased in all three species when exposed to 2ICO2. Elevated O3 affected few of these parameters but any change that was observed was opposite to that from exposure to 2ICO2-air. Interactive effects of CO2 and O3 on light-response parameters were limited. Carboxylation efficiencies, derived from CO2-response curves (A/Ci curves) decreased only in YP foliage exposed to 2ICO2-air. In general, growth was significantly stimulated by 2ICO2 in all three species; though there were few significant growth responses following exposure to 2IO3 or the combination of 2ICO2 plus 2IO3. Results indicate that responses to interacting stressors such as O3 and CO2 are species specific."

Biomass was evaluated following 3, 5, 7 and 13 wk exposure. Biomass following 13 wk exposure also included weekly harvests of mature tomato fruit beginning week 8. Carbon dioxide enrichment significantly enhanced total vegetative plant d. wt at each harvest, as well as cumulative yield of mature fruit, whereas O3 significantly suppressed total vegetative plant d. wt at each harvest and reduced total cumulative fruit yield. The magnitude of these changes varied with the development of tomato from early growth to mature fruit yield. Carbon dioxide enrichment reduced the detrimental effects of O3 on total vegetative plant d. wt of tomato following 3, 5, 7 and 13 wk exposure. Final mature fruit yield was 24% higher under enriched CO, treatments than in ambient CO2. Ozone suppressed final yield by 31 % following exposure to 80 nmol mol-1 O3 when compared with exposure to charcoal-filtered (CF) air. The impacts of both CO2 and O3 on yield were, however, dependent upon the presence or absence of the other gas. In the absence of O3, yields were very similar for the ambient and elevated CO2 treatments, but in the presence of O3, yields under ambient CO2 were greatly suppressed whereas yields under elevated CO2 were similar to those in the absence of O3. Thus, enriched CO2 ameliorated most of the suppressive effect of O3 on yield of mature fruit."

Controls had charcoal-filtered air. Effects on stomatal conductance, chlorophyll fluorescence and net photosynthesis are described. The fluorescence character, t(1/2), proved to be very sensitive to ozone, and it responded at all stages of plant development, but the ratio of variable to maximum fluorescence decreased only when plants received ozone during the first 2 wk of growth. The reduction was caused by a drop in maximum fluorescence. Ozone had no effect on F0. Whenever exposure occurred, O3 significantly reduced net CO2 assimilation and increased stomatal conductance. Unlike t(1/2), the effects were persistent, affecting leaves that were in bud or enshrouded by leaves when the exposure occurred. It is suggested that these persistent effects may have been caused by changes in resource allocation, flowering and senescence, which resulted in altered hormonal balance."

The results from two independent approaches ((a) statistical and (b) micrometeorological) were analyzed for understanding cause-effect relationships of the foliar injury responses of tobacco cv Bel-W3 to the exposure dynamics of ambient O(3) concentrations. Similarly, other results from two independent approaches were analyzed in: (1) establishing a micrometeorological relationship between hourly ambient O(3) concentrations and their vertical flux from the air into a natural grassland canopy; and (2) establishing a statistical relationship between hourly ambient O(3) concentrations in long-term, chronic exposures and crop yield reductions. Independent of the approach used, atmospheric conditions appeared to be most conducive and the crop response appeared to be best explained statistically by the cumulative frequency of hourly ambient O(3) concentrations between 50 ppb and 90 ppb (100 and 180 microg m(-3)). In general, this concentration range represents intermediate or moderately enhanced hourly O(3) values in a polluted environment. Further, the diurnal occurrence of this concentration range (often approximately between 0900 and 1600 h in a polluted, agricultural environment) coincided with the optimal CO(2) flux from the atmosphere into the crop canopy, thus high uptake. The frequency of occurrence of hourly O(3) concentrations &gt; 90 ppb (180 microg m(-3)) appeared to be of little importance and such concentrations in general appeared to occur during atmospheric conditions which did not facilitate optimal vertical flux into the crop canopy, thus low uptake. Alternatively, when &gt; 90 ppb (180 microg m(-3)) O(3) concentrations occurred during the 0900-1600 h window, their frequency of occurrence was low in comparison to the 50-90 ppb (100-180 microg m(-3)) range. Based on the overall results, we conclude that if the cumulative frequency of hourly ambient O(3) concentrations between 50-62 ppb (100-124 microg m(-3)) occurred during 53% of the growing season and the corresponding cumulative frequency of hourly O(3) concentrations between 50-74 ppb (100-148 microg m(-3)) occurred during 71% of the growing season, then yield reductions in sensitive crops could be expected, if other factors supporting growth, such as adequate soil moisture are not limiting."

Effects of open-top chambers on microclimate, ozone flux, and plant growth","Fuhrer, J",1994.0,"Open-top chambers (OTC) were established in a field of managed pasture, and environmental parameters were recorded inside and outside to study the influence of OTCs on radiation, air temperature (Tair), saturation vapour pressure deficit (svpd), and soil water content in relationship to plant growth and yield. Canopy development in OTCs supplied with non-filtered air (NF) and in ambient (AA) plots was followed by measuring leaf area index (LAI). The dry matter yield was determined after three growth periods in each of two consecutive seasons. Boundary layer conductance (gbw) and wind speed (u) were measured along a vertical profile, and day-time flux were measured along a vertical profile, and day-time flux of O3 was estimated throughout the experiment on the basis of a mass balance. The vertical profile of u showed values in the range 1-1 2 m s-1 at the top of the canopy, and maximum gbw was 20-25 mm s-1. Average reduction in global radiation in OTCs was 25%, and volumetric soil water content was reduced by about 5%. Daily mean Tair was increased by 1 3 C, mean daily maximum svpd by 0 08 kPa, and the temperature sum (degree days with base temperature of +5 C) by 12%. Fluctuations in the difference in daily mean Tair and svpd during the daytime between OTCs and ambient air were related to canopy structure. Differences were largest after each cut and declined with increasing LAI. A small effect of changes in LAI on Tair and svpd occurred during periods with low soil water content. The flux of O3 in OTCs was largest (>100 Ag m-2 min-1) before and smallest (<20 Ag m-2 min-1) after each cut. Calculated deposition veloties for O3 (vd) in the range 0-3 cm s-1 were generally higher than those measured under most field conditions. Overall, in OTCs the deficit in soil and atmospheric moisture was larger than in the open field, and the increase in daily mean Tair was strongly influenced by the stage of canopy development. Changes in microclimate and incoming radiation affected pasture development. LAI was slightly reduced in OTCs as compared to AA plots. The total accumulated dry matter yield for all six growth periods was only about 7% lower in OTCs, but the contribution of clover to total forage mass declined during the experiment. OTCs had no significant effect on weeds. The results indicate that OTCs reduced the competitiveness of clover, and that the increase in growth of grasses compensates for the loss in clover yield. The shift in species composition caused by OTCs must be considered when studying the effect of pollutants on pasture."

The objective of this research was to test the ozone sensitivity of selected conifer species under controlled exposure conditions. Seedlings of three species of conifers, Table Mountain pine (Pinus pungens), Virginia pine (Pinus virginiana), and eastern hemlock (Tsuga canadensis), were exposed to various levels of ozone in open-top chambers for one to three seasons in Great Smoky Mountains National Park in Tennessee, USA. A combination of episodic profiles (1988) and modified ambient exposure regimes (1989-92) were used. Episodic profiles simulated an average 7-day period from a monitoring station in the Park. Treatments used in 1988 were: charcoal-filtered (CF), 1.0I ambient, 2.0I ambient, and ambient airuno chamber (AA). In 1989 a 1.5I ambient treatment was added, and in 1990, additional chambers were made available, allowing a 0.5I ambient treatment to be added. Height, diameter, and foliar injury were measured most years. Exposures were 3 years for Table Mountain pine (1988-90), 3 years for hemlock (1989-91), and 1 and 2 years for three different sets of Virginia pine (1990, 1990-91, and 1992). There were no significant (p<0.05) effects of ozone on any biomass fraction for any of the species, except for older needles in Table Mountain and Virginia pine, which decreased with ozone exposure. There were also no changes in biomass allocation patterns among species due to ozone exposure, except for Virginia pine in 1990, which showed an increase in the root:shoot ratio. There was foliar injury (chlorotic mottling) in the higher two treatments (1.0I and 2.0I for Table Mountain and 2.0I for Virginia pine), but high plant-to-plant variability obscured formal statistical significance in many cases. We conclude, at least for growth in the short-term, that seedlings of these three conifer species are insensitive to ambient and elevated levels of ozone, and that current levels of ozone in the Park are probably having minimal impacts on these particular species."

The study used a 2 x 2 factorial design with two concentrations of CO2 (ambient and elevated), two levels of O-3 (low and high) and three replicates of each treatment. The objective of this study was to assess the effects of chronic exposure to elevated CO2 and O-3, alone and in combination, on daily ET. This study evaluated three hypotheses: (i) because elevated CO2 stimulates stomatal closure, O-3 effects on ET will be less under elevated CO2 than under ambient CO2; (ii) elevated CO2 will ameliorate the long-term effects of O-3 on ET; and (iii) because conductance (g) decreases with decreasing SM, the impacts of elevated CO2 and O-3, alone and in combination, on water loss via g will be greater in early summer when SM is not limiting than to other times of the year. A mixed-model covariance analysis was used to adjust the daily ET for seasonality and the effects of SM and photosynthetically active radiation when testing for the effects of CO2 and O-3 on ET via the vapor pressure deficit gradient. The empirical results indicated that the interactive stresses of elevated CO2 and O-3 resulted in a lesser reduction in ET via reduced canopy conductance than the sum of the individual effects of each gas. CO2-induced reductions in ET were more pronounced when trees were physiologically most active. O-3-induced reductions in ET under ambient CO2 were likely transpirational changes via reduced conductance because needle area and root biomass were not affected by exposures to elevated O-3 in this study."

Previous studies in enclosures suggest that this level of [O(3)] will decrease leaf photosynthesis, thereby limiting growth and yield of Glycine max L. Merr. SoyFACE (Soybean Free Air gas Concentration Enrichment) is the first facility to elevate atmospheric [O(3)] (approximately 1.2x current) in replicated plots under completely open-air conditions within an agricultural field. Measurements of gas exchange (assimilation versus light and assimilation versus intercellular [CO(2)]) were made on excised leaves from control and treatment plots (n = 4). In contrast to expectations from previous chamber studies, elevated [O(3)] did not alter light-saturated photosynthesis (A(sat), P = 0.09), carboxylation capacity (V(c,max), P = 0.82), or maximum electron transport (J(max), P = 0.66) for the topmost most recently fully expanded leaf at any stage of crop development. Leaves formed during the vegetative growth stage did not show a significant ozone-induced loss of photosynthetic capacity as they aged. Leaves formed during flowering did show a more rapid loss of photosynthetic capacity as they aged in elevated [O(3)]. A(sat), V(c,max), and J(max) (P = 0.04, 0.004, and 0.002, respectively) were decreased 20% to 30% by treatment with ozone. This is noteworthy since these leaves provide photosynthate to the developing grain. In conclusion, a small (approximately 20%) increase in tropospheric [O(3)] did not significantly alter photosynthetic capacity of newly expanded leaves, but as these leaves aged, losses in photosynthetic carbon assimilation occurred."

Elevated ozone (mean 32.4 ppb) increased the total phenolic content of leaves and also had minor effects on the concentrations of individual compounds. Elevated ozone increased the net photosynthesis rate of red clover leaves before visible injuries by 21-23%.

The trees were grown in soil in natural microclimatic conditions under ambient ozone (control) and 1.4-1.7 x ambient (ele- vated) ozone from May 1996 to October 2001, and were measured for stem and foliage growth, net photosynthesis, stomatal conductance, stomatal density, visible injuries, foliar starch content and bud formation. After 6 years of exposure, the magnitude of ozone-induced growth reduc- tions in the sensitive clone was 12-48% (significant differ- ence), levels similar or greater than those reported earlier for 2- and 3-year-old saplings undergoing shorter expo- sures. h the tolerant clone, growth of these larger trees was reduced by 1-38% (significant difference in stem volume), although the saplings had previously been unaffected. In both clones, ozone stress led to significantly reduced leaf- level net photosynthesis but significantly increased stomatal conductance rates during the late summer, resulting in a lower carbon gain for bud formation and the onset of visi- ble foliar injuries. Increasing ozone sensitivity with dura- tion of exposure was explained by a change in growth form (relatively reduced foliage mass), a lower photosynthesis to stomatal conductance ratio during the late summer, and deleterious carry-over effects arising from the reduced number of over-wintering buds."

It was revealed that ozone is the main cause of foliar injury manifested as chlorotic mottle and premature needle senescence. Various morphological, physiological and biochemical alterations in the affected plants have been reported over a period of about 40 years of multidisciplinary research. Recently, the focus of research has shifted from studying the effects of ozone to multiple pollutant effects. Recent studies have indicated that the combination of ozone and nitrogen may alter biomass allocation in pines towards that of deciduous trees, accelerate litter accumulation, and increase carbon sequestration rates in heavily polluted forests. Further study of the effects of multiple pollutants, and their long-term consequences on the mixed conifer ecosystem, cannot be adequately done using the original San Bernardino Mountains Air Pollution Gradient network. To correct deficiencies in the design, the new site network is being configured for long-term studies on multiple air pollutant concentrations and deposition, physiological and biochemical changes in trees, growth and composition of over-story species, biogeochemical cycling including carbon cycling and sequestration, water quality, and biodiversity of forest ecosystems. Eleven sites have been re-established. A comparison of 1974 stand composition with data from 2000 stand composition indicate that significant changes in species composition have occurred at some sites with less change at other sites. Moist, high-pollution sites have experienced the greatest amount of forest change, while dryer low-pollution sites have experienced the least amount of stand change.

Using soil transplants, nutrient budgets, chamber experiments and multiple regression analyses, we show that soils, temperature, CO2, nutrient deposition, urban air pollutants and microclimatic variables could not account for increased growth in the city. Rather, higher rural ozone (O3) exposures reduced growth at rural sites. Urban precursors fuel the reactions of O3 formation, but NOx scavenging reactions7 resulted in lower cumulative urban O3 exposures compared to agricultural and forested sites throughout the northeastern USA. Our study shows the overriding effect of O3 despite a diversity of altered environmental factors, reveals ?footprints' of lower cumulative urban O3 exposures amidst a background of higher regional exposures, and shows a greater adverse effect of urban pollutant emissions beyond the urban core."

The USDA Forest Service administers a long-term, nationwide ozone biomonitoring program to address public and scientific concerns about ozone impacts on forest health. A systematic grid is used as the basis for biomonitoring site locations. At each site, trained field crews evaluate a maximum of thirty plants of up to six species and record the amount and severity of leaf-injury on individual plants. Injury from ozone was found more often on biomonitoring sites in the eastern Unites States than in the interior or west-coast areas. Further results from the northeast reveal that in any year, there is a higher percentage of ozone-injured plants with more severe symptoms in areas with relatively high ozone concentrations than in areas with relatively low ozone. In very dry years (e.g., 1999) the percentage of injured plants and injury severity estimates are both sharply reduced even though ambient ozone exposures are high. These findings demonstrate that biomonitoring data provide meaningful evidence of when high ozone concentrations during the growing season have biological significance. Any assessment of ozone stress in the forest environment must include both biomonitoring (i.e., plant response) and air quality data to be complete."

Little is known about the effect of these interacting gases on growth, survival, and productivity of forest ecosystems. In this study we assess the effects of three successive years of exposure to combinations of elevated CO2 and O3 on growth responses in a five trembling aspen (Populus tremuloides) clonal mixture in a regenerating stand. The experiment is located in Rhinelander, Wisconsin, USA (45?N 89?W) and employs free air carbon dioxide and ozone enrichment (FACE) technology. The aspen stand was exposed to a factorial combination of four treatments consisting of elevated CO2 (560 ppm), elevated O3 (episodic exposure-90 1 1-1 hour-1), a combination of elevated CO2 and O3, and ambient control in 30 m treatment rings with three replications. Our overall results showed that our three growth parameters including height, diameter and volume were increased by elevated CO2, decreased by elevated O3, and were not significantly different from the ambient control under elevated CO2+O3. However, there were significant clonal differences in the responses; all five clones exhibited increased growth with elevated CO2, one clone showed an increase with elevated O3, and two clones showed an increase over the control with elevated CO2+O3, two clones showed a decrease, and one was not significantly different from the control. Notably, there was a significant increase in current terminal shoot dieback with elevated CO2 during the 1999-2000 dormant season. Dieback was especially prominent in two of the five clones, and was attributed to those clones growing longer into the autumnal season where they were subject to frost. Our results show that elevated O3 negates expected positive growth effects of elevated CO2 in Populus tremuloides in the field, and suggest that future climate model predictions should take into account the offsetting effects of elevated O3 on CO2 enrichment when estimating future growth of trembling aspen stands.

For an equivalent dose within a single growing season, agricultural crops are the most sensitive to ozone, with hardwoods intermediate and conifers least sensitive. In contrast, all species display a similar decline in photosynthesis and growth in response to equivalent total uptake or uptake per leaf life span, with trees somewhat less sensitive than agricultural crops on a calendar time scale, but slightly more sensitive on a relative (leaf life span) time scale.

If current global emission trends continue, surface [031 is projected to rise a further 50% over this century, with larger increases in many locations including Northern Hemisphere forests. This review uses statistical meta-analysis to determine mean effects, and their confidence limits, of both the current and projected elevations Of [031 on light-saturated photosynthetic CO2 uptake (As,) and stomatal conductance (gs) in trees. In total, 348 measurements of As., from 61 studies and 266 measures of gs from 55 studies were reviewed. Results suggested that the elevation Of [031 that has occurred since the industrial revolution is depressing As., and gs by 11% (CI 9-13%) and 13% (CI 11-15%), respectively, where CI is the 95% confidence interval. In contrast to angiosperms, gymnosperms were not significantly affected. Both drought and elevated [CO2] significantly decreased the effect of ambient [O-3]. Younger trees (<4 years) were affected less than older trees. Elevation Of [03] above current levels caused progressively larger losses of As, and gs, including gymnosperms. Results are consistent with the expectation that damage to photosynthesis depends on the cumulative uptake of ozone (03) into the leaf. Thus, factors that lower gs lessen damage. Where both g, and [03] were recorded, an overall decline in A(sat) of 0.21% per mmol m(-2) of estimated cumulative 03 uptake was calculated. These findings suggest that rising [031, an often overlooked aspect of global atmospheric change, is progressively depressing the ability of temperate and boreal forests to assimilate carbon and transfer water vapour to the atmosphere, with significant potential effects on terrestrial carbon sinks and regional hydrologies."

A delay in stomatal responses (i.e., `sluggish? responses) to variable light was found to be both an effect of O3 exposure and a reason for increased O3  sensitivity in snap bean cultivars, as it implied higher O3  uptake during times of disequilibrium. Sluggishness increased the time to open (thus limiting CO2 uptake) and close stomata (thus increasing transpirational water loss) after abrupt changes in light level. Similar responses were shown by snap  beans and oaks, suggesting that O3-induced stomatal sluggishness is a common trait among different plant physiognomic classes.  Sluggish stomatal responses are suggested to be both an effect of O3 exposure and a reason of increased O3 sensitivity in plants."

Despite the vital role of guard cells in controlling plant water loss3, 4, ozone sensitivity1, 2 and CO2 supply2, 5, 6, 7, the genes encoding some of the main regulators of stomatal movements remain unknown.

However, the genes encoding membrane proteins that mediate guard cell anion efflux have not yet been identified. Here we report the mapping and characterization of an ozone-sensitive Arabidopsis thaliana mutant, slac1. We show that SLAC1 (SLOW ANION CHANNEL-ASSOCIATED 1) is preferentially expressed in guard cells and encodes a distant homologue of fungal and bacterial dicarboxylate/malic acid transport proteins. The plasma membrane protein SLAC1 is essential for stomatal closure in response to CO2, abscisic acid, ozone, light/dark transitions, humidity change, calcium ions, hydrogen peroxide and nitric oxide. Mutations in SLAC1 impair slow (S-type) anion channel currents that are activated by cytosolic Ca2+ and abscisic acid, but do not affect rapid (R-type) anion channel currents or Ca2+ channel function. A low homology of SLAC1 to bacterial and fungal organic acid transport proteins, and the permeability of S-type anion channels to malate9 suggest a vital role for SLAC1 in the function of S-type anion channels."

In general, short-term exposure to sulphur dioxide (SO2) promotes stomatal opening, whereas longer-term exposure can cause partial stomatal closure. By contrast, the effects of oxides of nitrogen (NOx) are often small or insignificant. The effects of ozone, and oxidative stress, are equally complex. Short-term exposure to ozone stimulates a rapid reduction in stomatal aperture, whilst longer-term exposure causes stomatal responses to become sluggish. The response of stomata to abscisic acid (ABA) has been shown to be slower in plants exposed to a combination of SO2 and NO2 suggesting an adverse effect on guard cell ABA signal transduction. In addition, ozone causes a reduction in stomatal closure under drought conditions. There is an increasing body of evidence to suggest that air pollutants and oxidative stresses can have a marked effect on the Ca2+ homeostasis of guard cells and the intracellular machinery responsible for stomatal movements. Here we discuss the effects of air pollutants on stomatal responses and their possible effects on Ca2+ based signalling in guard cells focusing on the effects of ozone and oxidative stress."

Plants synthesize the hormone abscisic acid (ABA) in response to drought, triggering a signalling cascade in guard cells that results in stomatal closure, thus reducing water loss1. ABA triggers an increase in cytosolic calcium in guard cells ([Ca2+]cyt)2, 3, 4, 5, 6 that has been proposed to include Ca2+ influx across the plasma membrane3, 5, 7, 8, 9. However, direct recordings of Ca 2+ currents have been limited3 and the upstream activation mechanisms of plasma membrane Ca2+ channels remain unknown. Here we report activation of Ca2+-permeable channels in the plasma membrane of Arabidopsis guard cells by hydrogen peroxide. The H2O2-activated Ca2+ channels mediate both influx of Ca2+ in protoplasts and increases in [Ca 2+]cyt in intact guard cells. ABA induces the production of H2O2 in guard cells. If H2O2 production is blocked, ABA-induced closure of stomata is inhibited. Moreover, activation of Ca2+ channels by H2O2 and ABA- and H2O2-induced stomatal closing are disrupted in the recessive ABA-insensitive mutant gca2. These data indicate that ABA-induced H2O2 production and the H2O 2-activated Ca2+ channels are important mechanisms for ABA-induced stomatal closing."

Further exposure causes stomata to become sluggish in response to environmental stimuli. Exposure to
elevated CO2 stimulates rapid stomata closure in response to increased Ci. This reduction in gs may not be sustained over time as
photosynthesis down-regulates and with it, gs. The relationship between gs and photosynthesis may not be constant because stomata
respond more slowly to environmental changes than photosynthesis, and because elevated CO2 may alter guard cell sensitivity to other signals. Also, reduced stomatal density (and gs) in response to long-term CO2 enrichment suggests sustained reduction in gs. Elevated CO2 is believed to ameliorate the deleterious O3 effects by reducing gs and thus the potential O3 flux into leaves. Confirmation that gs acclimation to CO2 enrichment does not lessen over time is critical for developing meaningful O3 flux scenarios."

The late peak is normal in plants lacking the G beta protein but missing in plants lacking the G alpha protein.

* Ground-level ozone (O3) curtails agricultural production in many regions world-wide. However, the etiology of O3 toxicity remains unclear. Activated oxygen species appear to inflict biochemical lesions and propagate defense responses that compound plant injury. Because some plant defense responses involve membrane-delimited GTPases (G proteins), we evaluated the O3 sensitivity of Arabidopsis mutants altered in the heterotrimeric G-protein pathway.
* Eight genotypes were treated with a range of O3 concentrations (0, 100, 175 and 250 nmol mol-1) for 13 d in controlled environment chambers.
* After treatment with O3, the epinasty typically observed for wild type leaves did not occur in mutant plants lacking the alpha subunit of the C-protein complex (gpal). O3-induced suppression of leaf chlorophyll levels and leaf mass per unit leaf area were less for gpal mutants and were not due to differences in O3 flux.
* There was a positive correlation between the lack of a G-protein alpha subunit and decreased O3 sensitivity. Our results suggest that a heterotrimeric G-protein is critically involved in the expression of O3 effects in plants."

Most importantly, antioxidants provide essential information on cellular redox state, and they influence gene expression associated with biotic and abiotic stress responses to maximize defense.

Hydrogen peroxide and superoxide anion radicals can substitute for ozone as the activation stimulus, which does not appear to require salicylate as an intermediary. The properties of the ozone-induced MAPK suggest that it may be SIPK (salicylate-induced protein kinase), a tobacco MAPK that is activated by a variety of stress treatments. The ability of ozone to activate SIPK indicates that this protein kinase acts as a very early transducer of redox stress signals in plant cells."

Through transgenic manipulation it has previously been shown that overexpression of SIPK leads to enhanced ozone-induced lesion formation with concomitant accumulation of ROS. In spite of this hypersensitive phenotype, the effect of this altered SIPK expression on the levels of various hormones that regulate ozone-induced cell death has remained unexplored. The response of both salicylate and ethylene, the major phytohormones that modulate ozone-induced cell death, have now been analysed in SIPK-OX tobacco plants. Ozone treatment strongly induced ethylene formation in the sensitive SIPK-OX plants at ozone concentrations that failed to elicit stress ethylene release in WT plants. By contrast, SIPK-overexpressing plants displayed no ozone-induced SA accumulation, whereas WT plants accumulated SA upon ozone exposure. Epistatic analysis of SIPK-OX function suggests that the ozone-induced cell death observed in SIPK-OX plants is either independent, or upstream, of SA accumulation."

This response is made possible by an integration of highly regulated signaling networks that mediate the perception of, and response to, this oxidative assault. In Arabidopsis thaliana, ROS-induced signaling has been shown to flow through a protein phosphorylation cascade involving the mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) AtMPK3 (MPK3) and AtMPK6 (MPK6). We found that RNAi-mediated silencing of MPK6 renders the plant more sensitive to ozone, as determined by visible leaf damage. The MPK6-RNAi genotype also displayed a more intense and prolonged activation of MPK3 compared to that of WT plants. An MPK3 loss-of-function genotype is similarly very sensitive to ozone, and displays an abnormally prolonged MPK6 activation profile, suggesting reciprocity in regulation between these two MAPKs.

Temporal patterns of ROS following a 6 h exposure to 300 nL L-1 of ozone in ozone-sensitive Wassilewskija (Ws-0) ecotype showed a biphasic ROS burst with a smaller peak at 4 h and a larger peak at 16 h. This was accompanied by a nitric oxide (NO) burst that peaked at 9 h. An analysis of antioxidant levels showed that both ascorbate (AsA) and glutathione (GSH) were at their lowest levels, when ROS levels were high in ozone-stressed plants. Whole genome expression profiling analysis at 1, 4, 8, 12 and 24 h after initiation of ozone treatment identified 371 differentially expressed genes. Early induction of proteolysis and hormone-responsive genes indicated that an oxidative cell death pathway was triggered rapidly. Down-regulation of genes involved in carbon utilization, energy pathways and signalling suggested an inefficient defense response. Comparisons with other large-scale expression profiling studies indicated some overlap between genes induced by ethylene and ozone, and a significant overlap between genes repressed by ozone and methyl jasmonate treatment. Further, analysis of cis elements in the promoters of ozone-responsive genes also supports the view that phytohormones play a significant role in ozone-induced cell death."

that O3-induced defense gene expression at this stage was mainly regulated by ET and JA. Clustering analysis

In sensitive plant species even a few hours of exposure to this potent oxidant (200-300 nL. L-1) leads to severe oxidative stress that manifests as visible cell death. In resistant plants usually no visible symptoms are observed on exposure to similar ozone concentrations. Naturally occurring variability to acute ozone in plants provides a valuable resource for examining molecular basis of the differences in responses to ozone. From our earlier study in Medicago truncatula, we have identified cultivar Jemalong is ozone sensitive and PI 464815 (JE154) is an ozone-resistant accession. Analyses of transcriptome changes in ozone-sensitive and resistant accession will provide important clues for understanding the molecular changes governing the plant responses to ozone. Results: Acute ozone treatment (300 nL L-1 for six hours) led to a reactive oxygen species (ROS) burst in sensitive Jemalong six hours post-fumigation. In resistant JE154 increase in ROS levels was much reduced compared to Jemalong. Based on the results of ROS profiling, time points for microarray analysis were one hour into the ozone treatment, end of treatment and onset of an ozone-induced ROS burst at 12 hours. Replicated temporal transcriptome analysis in these two accessions using 17 K oligonucleotide arrays revealed more than 2000 genes were differentially expressed. Significantly enriched gene ontologies (GOs) were identified using the Cluster Enrichment analysis program. A striking finding was the alacrity of JE154 in altering its gene expression patterns in response to ozone, in stark contrast to delayed transcriptional response of Jemalong. GOs involved in signaling, hormonal pathways, antioxidants and secondary metabolism were altered in both accessions. However, the repertoire of genes responding in each of these categories was different between the two accessions. Real-time PCR analysis confirmed the differential expression patterns of a subset of these genes. Conclusion: This study provided a cogent view of the unique and shared transcriptional responses in an ozone-resistant and sensitive accession that exemplifies the complexity of oxidative signaling in plants. Based on this study, and supporting literature in Arabidopsis we speculate that plants sensitive to acute ozone are impaired in perception of the initial signals generated by the action of this oxidant. This in turn leads to a delayed transcriptional response in the ozone sensitive plants. In resistant plants rapid and sustained activation of several signaling pathways enables the deployment of multiple mechanisms for minimizing the toxicity effect of this reactive molecule."

Beech trees changed their transcript levels in response to ozone. In the years 2005 and 2006 different transcription patterns were observed; this may have been a result of different weather conditions and ozone uptake. Furthermore, we obtained differences in mRNA expression patterns between shade and sun leaves. In the ozone-treated sun leaves of 2005, slightly up- and down-regulated transcript levels were detected, particularly in the spring and autumn, whereas shade leaves clearly exhibited reduced mRNA levels, particularly at the end of the vegetation period. In 2006, this pattern could not be confirmed, and in the autumn, four other transcripts were slightly up-regulated in ozone-treated shade leaves. In addition, two other transcripts were found to be influenced in sun leaves in the spring/summer. While we detected changes in the levels of only a few transcripts, the observed effects were not identical in both years. In conclusion, elevated ozone exhibited very small influence on the transcription levels of genes of mature beech trees.

Acute O(3) exposure (120 ppb) for 3 days did not cause any visible symptoms in developing leaves. However, higher amounts of reactive oxygen species and lipid peroxidation indicated that severe oxidative burst occurred. Immunoblot analysis of O(3)-induced known proteins revealed that proteins were modulated before symptoms became visible. Proteomic analysis identified a total of 20 and 32 differentially expressed proteins from O(3)-treated leaf and chloroplast, respectively. Proteins associated with photosynthesis, including photosystem I/II and carbon assimilation decreased following exposure to O(3). In contrast, proteins involved in antioxidant defense and carbon metabolism increased. The activity of enzymes involved in carbohydrate metabolism increased following exposure to O(3), which is consistent with the decrease in starch and increase in sucrose concentrations.

Capillary electrophoresis-mass spectrometry-based metabolomic profiling revealed accumulation of amino acids, gamma-aminobutyric acid, and glutathione in O-3 exposed leaves until 24 h over control. This systematic survey showed thatO(3) triggers a chain reaction of altered gene, protein and metabolite expressions involved in multiple cellular processes in rice."

However, current increasing trends in its background level are projecting a more severe threat to natural and cultivated plants in the near future. The present study has been designed to evaluate the impact of elevated concentrations of O-3 on phenotypical, physiological, and biochemical traits in two high-yielding cultivars of wheat, followed by analysis of the leaf proteome using one/two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (1-/2-DGE) coupled to immunoblotting and mass spectrometry analyses under near-natural conditions using open top chambers. Prominently, O-3 exposure caused specific foliar injury in both the wheat cultivars. Results also showed that O-3 stress significantly decreased photosynthetic rate, stomatal conductance, and chlorophyll fluorescence kinetics (F-v/F-m) in test cultivars. Biochemical evaluations further revealed a higher loss in photosynthetic pigments, whereas a significantly induced antioxidant system under elevated O-3 concentrations pointed toward an ability of O-3 to generate oxidative stress. 1-DGE analysis showed drastic reductions in the abundantly present ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (RuBisCO) large and small subunits. Western blot analysis confirmed induced accumulation of antioxidative enzymes like superoxide dismutase and ascorbate peroxidase protein(s) and common defense/stress-related thaumatin-like protein(s). 2-DGE analysis revealed a total of 38 differentially expressed protein spots, common in both the wheat cultivars. Among those, some major leaf photosynthetic proteins (including RuBisCO and RuBisCO activase) and important energy metabolism proteins (including ATP synthase, aldolase, and phosphoglycerate kinase) were drastically reduced, whereas some stress/defense-related proteins (such as harpin-binding protein and germin-like protein) were induced. In all, the present study reveals an intimate molecular network provoked by O-3 affecting photosynthesis and triggering antioxidative defense and stress-related proteins culminating in accelerated foliar injury in wheat plants."

In pathogen-infected leaves, SA is synthesized via two pathways, involving phenylalanine or isochorismate. SA biosynthesis under O-3 fumigation is not well understood. When we applied C-14-labeled benzoic acid (a precursor of SA in the pathway via phenylalanine) to O-3-exposed tobacco leaves, it was effectively metabolized to SA. However, the activity and mRNA level of isochorismate synthase (ICS) were not increased. In contrast, ICS activity was increased in O-3-exposed Arabidopsis thaliana L. These results suggest that SA is synthesized via benzoic acid from phenylalanine in O-3-exposed tobacco leaves but via isochorismate in Arabidopsis. Ethylene is a plant hormone that promotes leaf damage in O-3-exposed plants. During O-3 exposure, transgenic plants with a phenotype of reduced O-3-induced ethylene production accumulated less SA than did wild-type plants. O-3 increased the activity of phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL) and the transcript levels of the chorismate mutase (CM) and PAL genes in wild-type tobacco, but their induction was suppressed in the transgenic plants. These results indicate that ethylene promotes SA accumulation by regulating the expression of the CM and PAL genes in O-3-exposed tobacco."

The cellular O2.- accumulation is ethylene dependent, occurs ahead of the expanding lesions before visible symptoms appear, and is required for lesion propagation. Exogenous ethylene increased O2.- -dependent cell death, whereas impairment of ethylene perception by norbornadiene in rcdl or ethylene insensitivity in the ethylene-insensitive mutant ein2 and in the rcd1 ein2 double mutant blocked O2.- accumulation and lesion propagation. Exogenous methyl jasmonate inhibited propagation of cell death in rcd 1. Accordingly, the O3-exposed jasmonate-insensitive mutant jar1 displayed spreading cell death and a prolonged 02.- accumulation pattern. These results suggest that ethylene acts as a promoting factor during the propagation phase of developing oxyradical-dependent lesions, whereas jasmonates have a role in lesion containment, Interaction and balance between these pathways may serve to fine-tune propagation and containment processes, resulting in alternate lesion size and formation kinetics."

These pathways mediate O3 responses, particularly to acute exposure, and their manipulation protected several species against acute and chronic O3. We use chronic daily exposure of up to 163 ppb O3, and twice weekly application of up to 320 ?g plant?1  methyl jasmonate (MeJA) to test two hypothesizes: 1) a low rate of MeJA does not affect growth but increases O3 sensitivity; 2) a high rate inhibits growth but reduces O3  sensitivity. Both hypotheses were rejected. Growth declined with increases in both MeJA and O3. MeJA at 40 ?g plant?1 caused no direct effect, and at 160 ?g plant?1  reduced growth similarly at all O3. Neither rate altered O3 sensitivity. These additive responses are not consistent with protection by MeJA in this system. They may reflect inter-specific differences in signalling, since O3  concentrations used here exceeded some reported acute exposures. Alternatively, parallel responses to O3 and MeJA may suggest that O3-induced jasmonates play a developmental role in chronic response but no protective role in the absence of lesions characteristic of acute exposure. MeJA appears useful as a probe of these mechanisms."

Additionally, parameters associated with O-3 sensitivity were analysed, including stomatal conductance, sensitivity to and accumulation of reactive oxygen species, antioxidants, stress gene-expression and the accumulation of stress hormones. Each mutant has a unique phenotypic profile, with O-3 sensitivity caused by a unique set of alterations in these systems. O-3 sensitivity in these mutants is not caused by gross deficiencies in the antioxidant pathways tested here. The rcd3 mutant exhibits misregulated stomata. All mutants exhibited changes in stress hormones consistent with the known hormonal roles in defence and cell death regulation. One mutant, dubbed re-8, is an allele of the classic leaf development mutant reticulata and exhibits phenotypes dependent on light conditions.

To identify the stress-related signalling pathways and possible cross-talk controlled by an ABA-negative regulator, the protein phosphatase 2C abscisic acid insensitive1 (ABI1), we performed a genome-wide transcription profiling of O-3-treated wild-type and ABI1 knockout (abi1td) plants. In addition, to better understand ABA signalling and the interactions between stress response pathways, we performed a microarray analysis of drought-treated plants. Functional categorization of the identified genes showed that ABI1 is involved in the modulation of several cellular processes including metabolism, transport, development, information pathways and variant splicing. Comparisons with available transcriptome data sets revealed the extent of ABI1 involvement in both ABA-dependent and ABA-independent gene expression. Furthermore, in O-3 stress the ABA hypersensitivity of abi1td resulted in a significant reduction of the ABA level, ethylene (ET) over-production and O-3 tolerance. Moreover, the physical interaction of ABI1 with ACC synthase2 and ACC synthase6 was shown. We provide a model explaining how ABI1 can regulate both ABA and ET biosynthesis. Altogether, our findings indicate that ABI1 plays the role of a general signal transducer linking ABA and ET biosynthesis as well as signalling pathways to O-3 stress tolerance."

We recorded temporary inhibition of cytochrome capacity respiration and activation of AOX pathway capacity in tobacco plants (Nicotiana tabacum L. cv BelW3) fumigated with ozone (O-3). The AOX1a gene was used as a molecular probe to investigate its regulation by signal molecules such as hydrogen peroxide, nitric oxide (NO), ethylene (ET), salicylic acid, and jasmonic acid (JA), all of them reported to be involved in the O-3 response. Fumigation leads to accumulation of hydrogen peroxide in mitochondria and early accumulation of NO in leaf tissues. Although ET accumulation was high in leaf tissues 5 h after the start of O-3 fumigation, it declined during the recovery period. There were no differences in the JA and 12-oxo-phytodienoic acid levels of treated and untreated plants. NO, JA, and ET induced AOX1a mRNA accumulation. Using pharmacological inhibition of ET and NO, we demonstrate that both NO- and ET-dependent pathways are required for O-3-induced up-regulation of AOX1a.

We have used ozone (O-3) as a tool to elicit ROS-activated stress responses, and to activate cell death in plant leaves. Here, we have investigated the roles and interactions of ROS and NO in the induction and regulation of O-3-induced cell death. Treatment with O-3 induced a rapid accumulation of NO, which started from guard cells, spread to adjacent epidermal cells and eventually moved to mesophyll cells. During the later time points, NO production coincided with the formation of hypersensitive response (HR)-like lesions. The NO donor sodium nitroprusside (SNP) and O-3 individually induced a large set of defence-related genes; however, in a combined treatment SNP attenuated the O-3 induction of salicylic acid (SA) biosynthesis and other defence-related genes. Consistent with this, SNP treatment also decreased O-3-induced SA accumulation. The O-3-sensitive mutant rcd1 was found to be an NO overproducer; in contrast, Atnoa1/rif1 (Arabidopsis nitric oxide associated 1/resistant to inhibition by FSM1), a mutant with decreased production of NO, was also O-3 sensitive. This, together with experiments combining O-3 and the NO donor SNP suggested that NO can modify signalling, hormone biosynthesis and gene expression in plants during O-3 exposure, and that a functional NO production is needed for a proper O-3 response. In summary, NO is an important signalling molecule in the response to O-3."

However, whether ethylene acts alone or in conjunction with other signaling pathways is not clearly understood. Ethylene overproducer mutants, eto1 and eto3, produced high levels of ethylene and developed necrotic lesions in response to an acute O3 exposure that does not induce lesions in O3-tolerant wild-type Col-0 plants. Treatment of plants with ethylene inhibitors completely blocked O3- induced ethylene production and partially attenuated O3-induced cell death. Analyses of the responses of molecular markers of specific signaling pathways indicated a relationship between salicylic acid (SA)- and ethylene-signaling pathways and O3 sensitivity. Both eto1 and eto3 plants constitutively accumulated threefold higher levels of total SA and exhibited a rapid increase in free SA and ethylene levels prior to lesion formation in response to O3 exposure. SA pre-treatments increased O3 sensitivity of Col-0, suggesting that constitutive high SA levels prime leaf tissue to exhibit increased magnitude of O3-induced cell death. NahG and npr1 plants compromised in SA signaling failed to produce ethylene in response to O3 and other stress factors suggesting that SA is required for stress-induced ethylene production. Furthermore, NahG expression in the dominant eto3 mutant attenuated ethylene-dependent PR4 expression and rescued the O3-induced HR (hypersensitive response) cell death phenotype exhibited by eto3 plants. Our results suggest that both SA and ethylene act in concert to influence cell death in O3-sensitive genotypes, and that O3-induced ethylene production is dependent on SA."

Exposure to environmental ozone can cause significant damage to plants by imposing conditions of oxidative stress. We examined whether increasing the level of Asc through enhanced Asc recycling would limit the deleterious effects of environmental oxidative stress. Plants overexpressing dehydroascorbate reductase (DHAR), which results in an increase in the endogenous level of Asc, were exposed to acute or chronic levels of ozone. DHAR-overexpressing plants had a lower oxidative load, a lower level of oxidative-related enzyme activities, a higher level of chlorophyll, and a higher level of photosynthetic activity 24 h following an acute exposure (2 h) to 200 ppb ozone than control plants, despite exhibiting a larger stomatal area. Reducing the size of the Asc pool size through suppression of DHAR expression had the opposite effect. Following a chronic exposure (30 d) to 100 ppb ozone, plants with a larger Asc pool size maintained a larger stomatal area and a higher oxidative load, but retained a higher level of photosynthetic activity than control plants, whereas plants suppressed for DHAR had a substantially reduced stomatal area, but also a substantially lower level of photosynthetic activity. Together, these data indicate that, despite a reduced ability to respond to ozone through stomatal closure, increasing the level of Asc through enhanced Asc recycling provided greater protection against oxidative damage than reducing stomatal area."

Monodehydroascorbate reductase (MDAR; EC 1.6.5.4) is crucial for AsA regeneration and essential for maintaining a reduced pool of AsA. To examine whether an overexpressed level of MDAR could minimize the deleterious effects of environmental stresses, we developed transgenic tobacco plants overexpressing Arabidopsis thaliana MDAR gene (AtMDAR1) in the cytosol. Incorporation of the transgene in the genome of tobacco plants was confirmed by PCR and Southern-blot analysis and its expression was confirmed by Northern- and Western-blot analyses. These transgenic plants exhibited up to 2.1-fold higher MDAR activity and 2.2-fold higher level of reduced AsA compared to non-transformed control plants. The transgenic plants showed enhanced stress tolerance in term of significantly higher net photosynthesis rates under ozone, salt and polyethylene glycol (PEG) stresses and greater PSII effective quantum yield under ozone and salt stresses. Furthermore, these transgenic plants exhibited significantly lower hydrogen peroxide level when tested under salt stress. These results demonstrate that an overexpressed level of MDAR properly confers enhanced tolerance against ozone, salt and PEG stress."

Exposure to elevated O-3 typically results in suppressed photosynthesis, accelerated senescence, decreased growth and lower yields. Various approaches used to evaluate O-3 effects generally concur that current yield losses range from 5% to 15% among sensitive plants. There is, however, considerable genetic variability in plant responses to O-3. To illustrate this, we show that ambient O-3 concentrations in the eastern United States cause substantially different levels of damage to otherwise similar snap bean cultivars. Largely undesirable effects of O-3 can also occur in seed and fruit chemistry as well as in forage nutritive value, with consequences for animal production. Ozone may alter herbicide efficacy and foster establishment of some invasive species. We conclude that current and projected levels of O-3 in many regions worldwide are toxic to sensitive plants of agricultural and horticultural significance. Plant breeding that incorporates O-3 sensitivity into selection strategies will be increasingly necessary to achieve sustainable production with changing atmospheric composition, while reductions in O-3 precursor emissions will likely benefit world food production and reduce atmospheric concentrations of an important greenhouse gas."

The belief is oxidative products formed in ozone exposed leaves, e.g. hydrogen peroxide, are responsible for much of the biochemical adjustments. The first line of defense is a range of antioxidants, such as ascorbate and glutathione, but if this defense is overwhelmed, subsequent actions occur, similar to systemic acquired resistance or general wounding. Yet there are seemingly unrelated metabolic responses which are also triggered, such as early senescence.

The present investigation was done to assess the effects of elevated O-3 (70 and 100 ppb) on electron transport, carbon fixation, stomatal conductance and pigment concentrations in two tropical soybean (Glycine max L.) varieties, PK 472 and Bragg. Plants were exposed to O-3 for 4 h center dot day-1 from 10:00 to 14:00 from germination to maturity. Photosynthesis of both varieties were adversely affected, but the reduction was higher in PK 472 than Bragg. A comparison of chlorophyll a fluorescence kinetics with carbon fixation suggested greater sensitivity of dark reactions than light reactions of photosynthesis to O-3 stress. The O-3-induced uncoupling between photosynthesis and stomatal conductance in PK 472 suggests the reduction in photosynthesis may be attributed to a factor other than reduced stomatal conductance. An increase in internal CO2 concentration in both O-3-treated soybean varieties compared suggests that the reduction in photosynthesis was due to damage to the photosynthetic apparatus, leading to accumulation of internal CO2 and stomatal closure. The adverse impact of O-3 stress increased at higher O-3 concentrations in both soybean varieties leading to large reductions in photosynthesis. This study suggests that O-3-induced reductions in photosynthesis in tropical and temperate varieties are similar."

Seedlings of Populus nigra L., Viburnum lantana L. and Fraxinus excelsior L. were exposed to charcoal-filtered air (CF) and non-filtered air (NF) in open-top chambers, and to ambient air (AA) in open plots during the 2001 and 2002 growing seasons. Ambient ozone exposures in the region were sufficient to cause visible foliar injury, early leaf senescence and premature leaf loss in all species. Ozone had significant negative effects on net photosynthesis and stomatal conductance in all species in 2002 and in V. lantana and F. excelsior in 2001. Water-use efficiency decreased and intercellular CO(2) concentrations increased in all species in response to ozone in 2002 only. The width and delta(13)C of the 2001 and 2002 growth rings were measured for all species at the end of the 2002 growing season. Compared with CF seedlings, mean ring width in the AA and NF P. nigra seedlings was reduced by 52 and 46%, respectively, in 2002, whereas in V. lantana and F. excelsior, ring width showed no significant reductions in either year. Although delta(13)C was usually more negative in CF seedlings than in AA and NF seedlings, with the exception of F. excelsior in 2001, ozone effects on delta(13)C were significant only for V. lantana and P. nigra in 2001. Among species, P. nigra exhibited the greatest response to ozone for the measured parameters as well as the most severe foliar injury and was the only species to show a significant reduction in ring width in response to ozone exposure, despite significant negative ozone effects on leaf gas exchange and the development of visible foliar injury in V. lantana and F. excelsior. Thus, significant ozone-induced effects at the leaf level did not correspond to reduced tree-ring growth or increased delta(13)C in all species, indicating that the timing of ozone exposure and severity of leaf-level responses may be important in determining the sensitivity of tree productivity to ozone exposure."

To investigate the impact Of O-3 on C-4 plant species, maize seedlings (Zea mays L. cv. Chambord) were exposed to 5 atmospheres in open-top chambers: non-filtered air (NF, 48 nL L-1 O-3) and NF supplied with 20 (+20), 40 (+40), 60 (+60), and 80 (+80) nL L-1 ozone. An unchambered plot was also available. Leaf area, vegetative biomass, and leaf dry mass per unit leaf area (LMA) were evaluated 33 days after seedling emergence in OTCs. At the same time, photosynthetic pigments as well as carboxylase (PEPc and Rubisco) activities and amounts were also examined in the 5th leaf. Ozone enhanced visible symptoms characterizing foliar senescence. Across NF, +20, +40, and +60 atmospheres, both chlorophylls and carotenoids were found to be linearly decreased against increasing AOT40 (ca. -50% in +60). No supplementary decrease was observed between +60 and +80. Total above-ground biomass was reduced by 26% in +80 atmosphere; leaf dry matter being more depressed by ozone than leaf area. In some cases, LMA index was consistent to reflect low negative effects caused by a moderate increase in ozone concentration. PEPc and Rubisco were less sensitive to ozone than pigments: only the two highest external ozone doses reduced their activities by about 20-30%. These changes might be connected to losses in PEPc and Rubisco proteins that were decreased by about one-third. The underlying mechanisms for these results were discussed with special reference to C-3 species. To conclude, we showed that both light and dark reactions of C-4 photosynthesis can be impaired by realistic ozone doses."

Long-term exposure of higher plants to low ozone concentrations affects biochemical processes prior to any visible symptoms of injury. The current critical level of ozone used to determine the threshold for damaging plants (biomass loss) is still based on the seasonal sum of the external concentration above 40 nl center dot l-1 (AOT40). Taking into account stomatal conductance and the internal capacity of leaf defences, a more relevant concept should be based upon the 'effective ozone flux', the balance between the stomatal flux and the intensity of cellular detoxification. The large decrease in the Rubisco/PEPc ratio reflects photosynthetic damage from ozone, and a large increase in activity of cytosolic PEPc, which allows increased malate production. Although the direct detoxification of ozone (and ROS produced from its decomposition) is carried out primarily by cell wall ascorbate, the existing level of this antioxidant is not sufficient to indicate the degree of cell sensitivity. In order to regenerate ascorbate, NAD(P)H is needed as the primary supplier of reducing power. It is hypothesised that increased activity of the catabolic pathways and associated shunts (glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, NADP-dependent glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, isocitrate dehydrogenase and malic enzyme) can provide sufficient NAD(P)H to maintain intracellular detoxification. Thus, measurement of the level of redox power would contribute to determination of the 'effective ozone dose', serving ultimately to improve the ozone risk index for higher plants."

Most of these metabolites are synthesized via the three aromatic amino acids phenylalanine, tyrosine and tryptophan. Before branching, the biosynthetic pathway to the three amino acids shares seven enzymatic steps, called the prechorismate pathway, catalysed by 3-deoxy-D-arabino-heptulosonate-7-phosphate (DAHP) synthase [EC 2.5.1.54], 3-dehydroquinate synthase [EC 4.2.3.4], 3-dehydroquinate dehydratase [EC 4.2.1.10]-shikimate 5-dehydrogenase [EC 1.1.1.25], shikimate kinase [EC 2.7.1.71], 5-enolpyruvylshikimate 3-phosphate synthase [EC 2.5.1.19] and chorismate synthase [EC 4.2.3.5]).

Specific cDNA-fragments of the corresponding six genes were isolated from tobacco Bel W3 and used as probes for determining the expression of the prechorismate pathway genes. The fully expanded leaves of ozone treated plants, which developed symptoms like necrotic leaf spots and accumulation of aromatic metabolites, showed a clear induction of the shikimate pathway genes; indicating, that this induction is linked to the development of the symptoms. Distinct kinetics and magnitudes were observed in tobacco leaves for the ozone dependent enhanced mRNA accumulation of the aforementioned genes in BelW3. The strongest and earliest induction due to ozone treatment could be observed for DAHP synthase. An isoform-specific analysis of the transcripts showed a strong induction on transcript level only for one of three isoforms, which was followed by the induction of the DAHP synthase also on protein level. The different induction kinetics of the prechorismate pathway genes indicate that their regulation in response to ozone might be regulated by different signals, for example, ethylene, reactive oxygen species or salicylic acid, which also occur with different kinetics and thus may play different roles in the plant response to ozone."

This pollutant penetrates in leaves through stomata and quickly reacts inside leaves, thus making plants valuable ozone sinks, but at the same time triggers oxidation processes which lead to leaf injuries. To counteract these negative effects, plants produce an array of antioxidants which react with ozone and reactive molecules which ozone generates in the leaf tissues. In this study, we measured the effect of an ozone concentration which is likely to be attained in many areas of the world in the near future (80 ppb) on leaves of the vertical profile of the widespread agroforestry species Populus nigra. Changes in (1) physiological parameters (photosynthesis and stomatal conductance), (2) ozone uptake, (3) emission of volatile organic compounds (VOCs, i.e. isoprene, methanol and other oxygenated compounds), (4) concentration of antioxidant surface compounds, and (5) concentration of phenolic compounds were assessed. The aim was to assess whether the defensive pathways leading to isoprenoids and phenolics formation were induced when a moderate and chronic increment of ozone is not able to damage photosynthesis. No visual injuries and minor changes in physiology and ozone uptake were observed. The emission of isoprene and oxygenated six-carbon (C6) volatiles were inhibited by ozone, whereas methanol emission was increased, especially in developing leaves. We interpret these results as suggesting an ontogenetic shift in ozone-treated leaves, leading to a slower development and a faster senescence. Most surface and phenolic compounds showed a declining trend in concentration from the youngest to the fully expanded leaves. Ozone reduced the concentrations of chlorogenic acid derivatives at the leaf surface, whereas in total leaf extracts a metabolic shift towards few phenolics with higher antioxidant capacity was observed."

We will also turn to other types of abiotic stresses, less studied in relation to polyamine metabolism, such as mineral deficiencies, chilling, wounding, heavy metals, UV, ozone and paraquat, where polyamine metabolism is also modified. There is a great amount of data demonstrating that under many types of abiotic stresses, an accumulation of the three main polyamines putrescine, spermidine and spermine does occur. However, there are still many doubts concerning the role that polyamines play in stress tolerance. Several environmental challenges (osmotic stress, salinity, ozone, UV) are shown to induce ADC activity more than ODC. The rise in Put is mainly attributed to the increase in ADC activity as a consequence of the activation of ADC genes and their mRNA levels. On the other hand, free radicals are now accepted as important mediators of tissue injury and cell death. The polycationic nature of polyamines, positively charged at physiological pH, has attracted the attention of researchers and has led to the hypothesis that polyamines could affect physiological systems by binding to anionic sites, such as those associated with nucleic acids and membrane phospholipids. These amines, involved with the control of numerous cellular functions, including free radical scavenger and antioxidant activity, have been found to confer protection from abiotic stresses but their mode of action is not fully understood yet. In this review, we will also summarize information about the involvement of polyamines as antioxidants against the potential abiotic stress-derived oxidative damage."

The levels of free and conjugated putrescine were rapidly increased in the ozone-tolerant cultivar Bel B and remained high for 3 days. This accumulation was preceded by a transient rise of L-arginine decar-boxylase (ADC, EC 4.1.1.19) activity. The ozone-sensitive cultivar Bel W3 showed a rapid production of ethylene and high levels of 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid after 1 to 2 hours of exposure. Induction of putrescine levels and ADC activity was weak in this cultivar and was observed when necrotic lesions developed. Leaf injury occurred in both lines when the molar ratio of putrescine to 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid or ethylene fell short of a certain threshold value. Monocaffeoyl-putrescine, an effective scavenger for oxyradicals, was detected in the apo-plastic fluid of the leaves of cv Bel B and increased upon exposure to ozone. This extracellular localization could allow scavenging of ozone-derived oxyradicals at the first site of their generation. Induction of either polyamine or ethylene pathways may represent a control mechanism for inhibition or promotion of lesion formation and thereby contribute to the disposition of plants for ozone tolerance."

Emission of the related monoterpenes is more universal among plants, but the amount of isoprene emitted from plants dominates the biosphere-atmosphere hydrocarbon exchange. Scope The emission of isoprene from plants affects atmospheric chemistry. Isoprene reacts very rapidly with hydroxyl radicals in the atmosphere making hydroperoxides that can enhance ozone formation. Aerosol formation in the atmosphere may also be influenced by biogenic isoprene. Plants that emit isoprene are better able to tolerate sunlight-induced rapid heating of leaves (heat flecks). They also tolerate ozone and other reactive oxygen species better than non-emitting plants. Expression of the isoprene synthase gene can account for control of isoprene emission capacity as leaves expand. The emission capacity of fully expanded leaves varies through the season but the biochemical control of capacity of mature leaves appears to be at several different points in isoprene metabolism. Conclusions The capacity for isoprene emission evolved many times in plants, probably as a mechanism for coping with heat flecks. It also confers tolerance of reactive oxygen species. It is an example of isoprenoids enhancing membrane function, although the mechanism is likely to be different from that of sterols. Understanding the regulation of isoprene emission is advancing rapidly now that the pathway that provides the substrate is known."

Here we show that in Phragmites leaves isoprene emission was stimulated after a 3-h exposure to high ozone levels. The photosynthetic apparatus of leaves in which isoprene emission was inhibited by fosmidomycin became more susceptible to damage by ozone than in isoprene-emitting leaves. Three days after ozone fumigation, the necrotic leaf area was significantly higher in isoprene-inhibited leaves than in isoprene-emitting leaves. Isoprene-inhibited leaves also accumulated high amounts of nitric oxide (NO), as detected by epifluorescence light microscopy. Our results confirm that oxidative stresses activate biosynthesis and emission of chloroplastic isoprenoid, bringing further evidence in support of an antioxidant role for these compounds. It is suggested that, in nature, the simultaneous quenching of NO and reactive oxygen species by isoprene may be a very effective mechanism to control dangerous compounds formed under abiotic stress conditions, while simultaneously attenuating the induction of the hypersensitive response leading to cellular damage and death."

To understand whether this could be the result of a direct scavenging of ozone by these molecules, the stomatal and non-stomatal uptake of ozone was estimated in plants emitting isoprene or monoterpenes. Ozone uptake by holm oak (Quercus ilex, a monoterpene emitter) and black poplar (Populus nigra, an isoprene emitter) was studied in whole plant enclosures (continuously stirred tank reactors, CSTR). The ozone uptake by plants was estimated measuring ozone concentration at the inlet and outlet of the reactors, after correcting for the uptake of the enclosure materials. Destruction of ozone at the cuticle or at the plant stems was found to be negligible compared to the ozone uptake through the stomata. For both plant species, a relationship between stomatal conductance and ozone uptake was found. For the poplar, the measured ozone losses were explained by the uptake of ozone through the stomata only, and ozone destruction by gas phase reactions with isoprene was negligible. For the oak, gas phase reactions of ozone with the monoterpenes emitted by the plants contributed significantly to ozone destruction. This was confirmed by two different experiments showing a) that in cases of high stomatal conductance but under low CO2 concentration, a reduction of monoterpene emission was still associated with reduced O-3 uptake; and b) that ozone losses due to the gas phase reactions only can be measured when using the exhaust from a plant chamber to determine the gas phase reactivity in an empty reaction chamber. Monoterpenes can therefore relevantly scavenge ozone at leaf level contributing to protection against ozone."

Populus trichocarpa), previously classified as ozone tolerant and ozone sensitive, had differing physiological and biochemical responses when fumigated with 120 nL L<sup>??E?a??1</sup> ozone for 6 h per day for eight consecutive days. Isoprene emission rate, ozone uptake and a number of physiological and biochemical parameters were investigated before, during and after fumigation with ozone. Previous studies have shown that isoprene protects plants against oxidative stress. Therefore, it was hypothesized that these two genotypes would differ in either their basal isoprene emission rates or in the response of isoprene to fumigation by ozone. Our results showed that the basal emission rates of isoprene, physiological responses and ozone uptake rates were all similar. However, significant differences were found in visible damage, carotenoids, hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), thiobarbituric acid reactions (TBARS) and post-fumigation isoprene emission rates. It is shown that, although the classification of ozone tolerance or sensitivity had been previously clearly and carefully defined using one particular set of parameters, assessment of other key variables does not necessarily lead to the same conclusions. Thus, it may be necessary to reconsider the way in which plants are classified as ozone tolerant or sensitive.

A linear model was developed to estimate the influence of local environmental conditions on stomatal conductance. The most significant factors explaining stomatal variance were tree species, air temperature, leaf vapor pressure deficit, elevation, and time of day. Overall, environmental factors explained less than 35% of the variation in stomatal conductance. Ozone did not affect gas exchange rates in either poplar or cherry. Ozone-induced foliar injury was positively correlated with cumulative ozone exposures, expressed as SUM40.

Cutleaf coneflower exhibited a greater amount of foliar injury than crown-beard each year of the 2-year study. Incidence and severity of injury was significantly greater for cutleaf coneflower growing near the edge of the Clingmans Dome trail than in the interior of the stand. Injury was greater at Clingmans Dome than Purchase Knob (70% vs. 40% ozone-injured plants, respectively), coincident with greater ozone exposures.

Eleven sites located in the mixed conifer forest near ambient ozone monitoring sites were evaluated annually for 4 years. Four other sites in the San Bernardino Mountains were evaluated for 1 year. Analyses showed OII to be functionally equivalent (r2 = 0.96) to the FPM, and to depend only on fascicle retention and chlorotic mottle (R2 = 0.95) of the fourth whorl (or if four whorls are not present at the site, then the last whorl present for the majority of trees). Significant associations were found between OII and 4-year 24-h. summer SUM0, SUM06, W126 and HRS80 ozone indices. Three sites had higher levels of cumulative chlorotic mottle for individual whorls and larger numbers of trees with visible crown injury than other sites with similar cumulative ambient ozone levels.

Ambient ozone concentrations, meteorological parameters, leaf gas exchange and leaf water potential were measured at the sites during the growing seasons of 1998 and 1999. Visible ozone-induced foliar injury was assessed on leaves within the upper and lower crown branches of each tree. Ambient ozone exposures were sufficient to induce typical symptoms on cherry (0-5% total affected leaf area, LAA), whereas foliar injury was not observed on ash or maple. There was a positive correlation between increasing cumulative ozone uptake (U) and increasing percent of LAA for cherry grown under drier site conditions. The lower crown leaves of cherry showed more severe foliar injury than the upper crown leaves. No significant differences in predawn leaf water potential (psi(L)) were detected for all three species indicating no differing soil moisture conditions across the sites. Significant variation in stomatal conductance for water vapor (g,,) was found among species, soil moisture, time of day and sample date. When comparing cumulative ozone uptake and decreased photosynthetic activity (P,), red maple was the only species to show higher gas exchange under mesic vs. drier soil conditions (P < 0.05). The inconsistent differences in gas exchange response within the same crowns of ash and the uncoupling relationship between g(wv) and P-n demonstrate the strong influence of heterogeneous environmental conditions within forest canopies.

At all sites, gas exchange was under tight stomatal control during the growing season. Stomatal conductance was strongly correlated with leaf water potential (R-2 = 0.82), which decreased over the growing season with decreasing soil water content (R-2 = 0.60). Ozone uptake, carbon uptake, and transpirational water loss closely followed the dynamics of stomatal conductance. Peak ozone and CO2 uptake occurred in early summer and declined progressively thereafter. As a result, periods of maximum ozone uptake did not correspond to periods of peak ozone concentration, underscoring the inaropriateness of using current metrics based on concentration (e.g., SUM0, W126 and AOT40) for assessing ozone exposure risk to plants in this climate region. Both J(max) (maximum CO2-saturated photosynthetic rate, limited by electron transport) and V-cmax (maximum rate of Rubisco-limited carboxylation) increased toward the middle of the growing season, then decreased in September. Intrinsic water-use efficiency rose with increasing drought stress, as expected. The ratio of J(max) to V-cmax was similar to literature values of 2.0. Nighttime respiration followed a Q(10) of 2.0, but was significantly higher at the high-ozone site. Respiration rates decreased by the end of the summer as a result of decreased metabolic activity and carbon stores."

Predawn wa- ter potential of trees in the watered plot remained above -0.3 MPa throughout the growing season, whereas it dropped in the control plot from -0.24 to -0.52 MPa between late May and mid-August. Photosynthesis and stomatal conductance of trees in the watered plot were relatively insensitive to atmospheric vapor pressure deficit (VPD), whereas gas exchange of trees in the control plot varied with changes in soil water, VPD and temperature. Although the 1998 growing season was abnormally wet, we saw a pronounced drought effect at the control site. Over the 2 months following the onset of watering, carbon and ozone uptake were measured on three days at widely spaced intervals. Carbon uptake per unit leaf area by 1-year-old foliage of trees in the control plot was 39, 35 and 30% less, respectively, than in the watered plot, and estimated ozone deposition per unit leaf area (ozone concentration times stomatal conductance) was 36, 46 and 41% less."

We found significant variation in A, gwv, foliar injury, and NL (P < 0.05) among O3 treatments. Seedlings in AA showed the highest A and gwv due to relatively low vapor pressure deficit (VPD). Older leaves showed significantly lower A, gwv, NL, and higher foliar injury (P < 0.001) than younger leaves. Leaf age affected the response of A, gwv, and foliar injury to O3. Both VPD and NL had a strong influence on leaf gas exchange. Foliar O3-induced injury appeared when cumulative O3 uptake reached 8?12 mmol m?2, depending on soil water availability.

Quantifying possible regional-scale impacts of ambient ozone on forest tree species is difficult and is confounded by other factors, such as moisture and light, which influence the uptake of ozone by plants. Biomonitoring provides an approach to document direct foliar injury irrespective of direct measure of ozone uptake. We used bioindicator and field plot data from the USDA Forest Service to identify tree species likely to exhibit regional-scale ozone impacts. Approximately 24% of sampled sweetgum (Liquidambar styraciflua), 15% of sampled loblolly pine (Pinus taeda), and 12% of sampled black cherry (Prunus serotina) trees were in the highest risk category. Sweetgum and loblolly pine trees were at risk on the coastal plain ofMaryland, Virginia and Delaware. Black cherry trees were at risk on the Allegheny Plateau (Pennsylvania), in the Allegheny Mountains (Pennsylvania, West Virginia, and Maryland) as well as coastal plain areas of Maryland and Virginia. Our findings indicate a need for more in-depth study of actual impacts on growth and reproduction of these three species."

A cross-sectional survey was performed among 667 high school students in the schools. Outdoor and indoor nitrogen dioxide (NO(2)) and ozone (O(3)) concentrations were also measured by passive samplers in the same schools to investigate possible routes of exposure. Chronic pulmonary disease (OR = 1.49; 95%CI: 1.11-1.99; p = 0.008), tightness in the chest (OR = 1.57; 95%CI: 1.22-2.02; p = 0.001), morning cough (OR = 1.81 95%CI: 1.19-2.75; p = 0.006) were higher among students in the industrial zone where nitrogen dioxide and ozone levels were also highest. There were no indoor sources of nitrogen dioxide and ozone exists in the schools except for the dining hall. As a conclusion, this study has noticed that air pollution and respiratory health problems among high school students are high in industrial zones and the use of passive samplers combined with GIS is an effective tool that may be used by public health researchers to identify pollutant zones and persons at risk."

The trees were measured for gas exchange, leaf size, date of leaf abscission, size and biochemical characteristics of the overwintering buds and early leaf development during the 8th-9th year of free-air CO2 and O-3 exposure at the Aspen FACE site located near Rhinelander, WI. Net photosynthesis was enhanced 49-73% by elevated [CO2], and decreased 13-30% by elevated [O-3]. Elevated [CO2] delayed, and elevated [O-3] tended to accelerate, leaf abscission in autumn. Elevated [CO2] increased the ratio of monosaccharides to di- and oligosaccharides in aspen buds, which may indicate a lag in cold acclimation. The total carbon concentration in overwintering buds was unaffected by the treatments, although elevated [O-3] decreased the amount of starch by 16% in birch buds, and reduced the size of aspen buds, which may be related to the delayed leaf development in aspen during the spring.

Elevated CO2 increased both male and female flower production, while elevated O3 increased female flower production compared to trees in control rings. Interestingly, very little flowering has yet occurred in combined treatment. Elevated CO2 had significant positive effect on birch catkin size, weight, and germination success rate (elevated CO2 increased germination rate of birch by 110% compared to ambient CO2 concentrations, decreased seedling mortality by 73%, increased seed weight by 17%, increased root length by 59%, and root-to-shoot ratio was significantly decreased, all at 3 weeks after germination), while the opposite was true of elevated O3 (elevated O3 decreased the germination rate of birch by 62%, decreased seed weight by 25%, and increased root length by 15%). Under elevated CO2, plant dry mass increased by 9 and 78% at the end of 3 and 14 weeks, respectively. Also, the root and shoot lengths, as well as the biomass of the seedlings, were increased for seeds produced under elevated CO2, while the reverse was true for seedlings from seeds produced under the elevated O3. Similar trends in treatment differences were observed in seed characteristics, germination, and seedling development for seeds collected in both 2004 and 2005.

We conducted a study in which ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) seedlings were exposed to two levels of CO(2) and O(3) in sun-lit controlled-environment mesocosms for 3 years. Minirhizotrons were used to monitor individual fine roots in three soil horizons every 28 days. Proportional hazards regression was used to analyze effects of CO(2), O(3), diameter, depth, and season of root initiation on fine-root survivorship. More fine roots were produced in the elevated CO(2) treatment than in ambient CO(2). Elevated CO(2), increasing root diameter, and increasing root depth all significantly increased fine-root survivorship and median life span. Life span was slightly, but not significantly, lower in elevated O(3), and increased O(3) did not reduce the effect of elevated CO(2). Median life spans varied from 140 to 448 days depending on the season of root initiation.

The main difference between previous studies and our approach was that previous studies were performed on seedlings in pot experiments or in closed or open top chambers, and not in situ, in a mature forest stand. Although beech is a relatively unresponsive species to tropospheric O-3, we found a pronounced effect of 2 x O-3 on the number of vital ectomycorrhizal root tips and non-turgescent fine roots. Both categories of roots were significantly increased when compared to controls in two consecutive years at each sampling event. The number of types of ectomycorrhizae and species richness increased in 2004, but not in the extremely dry year 2003. We hypothesised that the observed changes might be an expression of a transitional state in below-ground succession of niches caused by an O-3 induced effect on carbon allocation to roots and the rhizosphere. We have detected changes in ectomycorrhizal species level, however Shannon-Weavers species diversity index and percentage of types of ectomycorrhizae did not change significantly in any sampling year thus indicating our results cannot be unequivocally explained by summer drought in year 2003 or by O-3 exposure alone."

Because of the importance of fine roots to the belowground C cycle, we monitored fine-root biomass and associated C fluxes in regenerating stands of trembling aspen, and mixed stands of trembling aspen and paper birch at FACTS-II, the Aspen FACE project in Rhinelander, Wisconsin. Free-air CO2 enrichment (FACE) was used to elevate concentrations of CO2 (average enrichment concentration 535 Al l-1) and O3 (53 nl l-1) in developing forest stands in 1998 and 1999. Soil respiration, soil pCO2, and dissolved organic carbon in soil solution (DOC) were monitored biweekly. Soil respiration was measured with a portable infrared gas analyzer. Soil pCO2 and DOC samples were collected from soil gas wells and tension lysimeters, respectively, at depths of 15, 30, and 125 cm. Fine-root biomass averaged 263 g m-2 in control plots and increased 96% under elevated CO2. The increased root biomass was accompanied by a 39% increase in soil respiration and a 27% increase in soil pCO2. Both soil respiration and pCO2 exhibited a strong seasonal signal, which was positively correlated with soil temperature. DOC concentrations in soil solution averaged ~12 mg l-1 in surface horizons, declined with depth, and were little affected by the treatments. A simplified belowground C budget for the site indicated that native soil organic matter still dominated the system, and that soil respiration was by far the largest flux. Ozone decreased the above responses to elevated CO2, but effects were rarely statistically significant. We conclude that regenerating stands of northern hardwoods have the potential for substantially greater C input to soil due to greater fine-root production under elevated CO2. Greater fine-root biomass will be accompanied by greater soil C efflux as soil respiration, but leaching losses of C will probably be unaffected."

Presently, it is uncertain how increasing atmospheric CO2 and O-3 will alter plant N demand and the acquisition of soil N by plants as well as the microbial supply of N from soil organic matter. To address this uncertainty, we initiated an ecosystem-level N-15 tracer experiment at the Rhinelander (Wisconsin, USA) free air CO2-O-3 enrichment (FACE) facility to understand how projected increases in atmospheric CO2 and O-3 alter the distribution and flow of N in developing northern temperate forests. Tracer amounts of (NH4+)-N-15 were applied to the forest floor of developing Populus tremuloides and P. tremuloides - Betula papyrifera communities that have been exposed to factorial CO2 and O-3 treatments for seven years. One year after isotope addition, both forest communities exposed to elevated CO2 obtained greater amounts of N-15 (29%) and N (40%) from soil, despite no change in soil N availability or plant N-use efficiency. As such, elevated CO2 increased the ability of plants to exploit soil for N, through the development of a larger root system. Conversely, elevated O-3 decreased the amount of N-15 (-15%) and N (-29%) in both communities, a response resulting from lower rates of photosynthesis, decreases in growth, and smaller root systems that acquired less soil N. Neither CO2 nor O-3 altered the amount of N or N-15 recovery in the forest floor, microbial biomass, or soil organic matter. Moreover, we observed no interaction between CO2 and O-3 on the amount of N or N-15 in any ecosystem pool, suggesting that O-3 could exert a negative effect regardless of CO2 concentration. In a CO2-enriched atmosphere, greater belowground growth and a more thorough exploitation of soil for growth-limiting N is an important mechanism sustaining the enhancement of NPP in developing forests (0-8 years following establishment). However, as CO2 accumulates in the Earth's atmosphere, future O-3 concentrations threaten to diminish the enhancement of plant growth, decrease plant N acquisition, and lessen the storage of anthropogenic C in temperate forests."

A novel canopy O3 exposure methodology was employed that allowed whole-tree assessment in situ  under twice-ambient O3 levels. Elevated O3 significantly weakened the C sink strength of the tree?soil system as evidenced by lowered photosynthesis and 44% reduction in whole-stem growth, but increased soil respiration. Associated effects in leaves and roots at the gene, cell and organ level varied from year to year, with drought being a crucial determinant of O3 responsiveness. Regarding adult individuals of a late-successional tree species, empirical proof is provided first time in relation to recent modelling predictions that enhanced ground-level O3 can substantially mitigate the C sequestration of forests in view of climate change.  Empirical proof corroborates substantial mitigation of carbon sequestration in the tree?soil system of a forest site under enhanced O3 impact for adult beech."

Here, we used meta-analysis combined with pairwise techniques to examine root mass fraction (RMF; i.e., the fraction of root to total biomass) as affected by elevated CO(2) and environmental stresses. Our results showed that lower soil fertility increased RMF and the magnitude was similar for ambient and elevated CO(2)-grown plants. Lower soil water also increased RMF, but to a greater extent at elevated than at ambient CO(2). While CO(2) enrichment had little effect on the magnitude of O(3)-caused reduction in RMF in herbaceous species, it alleviated the adverse effect of higher O(3) on root production in woody species. These results demonstrate that CO(2) has less pronounced effects on RMF than other environmental factors. Under abiotic stresses, e.g., drought and higher O(3), elevated CO(2)-grown plants will likely increase biomass allocation below-ground. Because of the non-uniform changes in drought and O(3) projected for different parts of the world, we conclude that elevated CO(2) will have regional, but not global, effects on biomass allocation under various global change scenarios."

Effects on gas exchange, vegetative growth, reproductive development and seed yield were determined. Impacts on gas exchange and foliar injury were related to pre-exposure stomatal conductance. Exposure for 2 d had no effect on growth or reproductive characteristics, whereas 10-d exposure reduced vegetative growth and reproductive site number on the terminal raceme. Mature seed number and weight per pod and per plant were unaffected because seed abortion was reduced. The observation that mature seed yield per plant was unaffected by exposure during the vegetative phase, despite adverse effects on physiological, vegetative and reproductive processes, shows that indeterminate species such as B. campestris possess sufficient compensatory flexibility to avoid reductions in seed production."

Spreading dogbane (Apocynum androsaemifolium L.) is one of many indigenous herbaceous plant species exhibiting foliar injury that are commonly monitored in ecosystem assessment programs. Details about possible effects of ambient ozone on reproductive components of these species are lacking. For 103 days, from 31 May to 10 September, A. androsaemifolium plants were grown in open-top chambers in either carbon-filtered air (CF), non-filtered air (NF) (approximately 1Iambient), or chamberless ambient air plots (AA). Aspects of sexual reproduction were measured to determine whether impairment occurs in polluted air. Additionally, the ozone protectant chemical ethylenediurea (EDU) was applied to foliage to determine its effect on foliar injury. By the end of the experiment visible foliar injury was absent in CF air and nominal in the NF and AA treatments. Plants grown in CF-chamber air produced significantly more flowers and fruits than those grown in either NF-chamber air or AA plots. Flowers produced by plants grown in CF air also survived to mature fruits at a rate 1.7I greater than plants in NF air and 1.5I greater than plants in AA plots. We were unable to conclude whether EDU protected plants from foliar ozone injury due to the general lack of foliar injury in ozone-exposed plants. The results demonstrate that foliar injury is not necessarily required to elicit negative effects on sexual reproduction in A. androsaemifolium. Implications for the population biology of A. androsaemifolium related to adverse effects of chronic ozone exposure on sexual reproduction are discussed."

Destructive harvests were conducted at the end of the exposure period to determine dry weights of both above- and below-ground plant components. All cultivars had symptoms of visible injury in the twice-ambient treatment at both three and eight weeks after exposures began. No visible symptoms were observed at ambient ozone concentrations. At three weeks of exposure, `Pink Delight' had the highest percentage of the leaves injured (PLI), 46.2%, followed by `Opera' with a PLI of 23.3%. The other three cultivars had similar PLIs of less than 15%. After eight weeks of exposure, visible injury was equally severe on all cultivars with a mean PLI of 50.2% and mean Horsfall-Barratt rating of 5.4, indicating 12 to 25% of the leaf area was injured. No ozone x cultivar interaction was found for any growth variable measured. Across cultivars, growth index was reduced by 6%, total dry weight by 35%, and the number of developing floral buds and inflorescences by 29% for plants in twice-ambient ozone concentrations compared to ambient ozone concentrations. Percent biomass allocated to inflorescences was significantly greater for plants exposed to sub-ambient levels compared to those exposed to ozone at either ambient or twice-ambient concentrations.

Either leaf 1 or leaf 3 (from the most recent fully expanded) were exposed to a 30-min 14C02 pulse. The sink strength and relative specific uptake of sink tissues were determined after 24 h and 48 h.
* Ozone did not affect the sink strength of fruits, but there was a trend to decreasing relative specific uptake of fruits when leaf 1, but not when leaf 3, was labelled. Ozone increased the sink strength of leaf blades younger than the source leaf when leaf 3 was labelled. Leaf 3, but not leaf 1, distributed assimilates mostly to the fruit. Ozone increased the sink strength of petioles in deblossomed  plants.

Because populations have been shown to differ in ozone resistance, the aim of the experiment was to compare the reaction of populations from contrasting ozone climates to different types of ozone exposure. Three populations were grown under controlled conditions in five different ozone treatments (including controls for 10 wk. Development, growth, stomatal conductance and seed production were recorded. Populations were from the south coast of England (Lullington), near a mountain summit (Great Dun Fell) and lowland Scotland (Bush). Ozone treatments were: charcoal and Purafil filtered sir (CF); 35 nIl-1 for 24 h every day; 70 nil-' h for 7 h every day; CF then three episodes each week of 70 nIl~' for 7 h; and 35 nIl~' continuously plus three 7 h episodes each week of 70 nI 1'. The different ozone treatments resulted in different responses in each population. Ozone promoted senescence in the Great Dun Fell population but not in the others; it reduced root growth more in the Lullington population than in the others but those from Lullington and Great Dun Fell maintained seed production to a much greater extent than the Bush population. The reproductive effort (number of seeds g' of vegetative weight> actually increased in ozone in the Lullington and Great Dun Fell populations. It is suggested that this might be a general stress response rather than being specifically related to ozone. Effects on stomatal conductance were similar to those previously reported and the converse of effects on seed production. The relative responses of the populations varied according to the ozone treatment. Continuous exposure to 35 nl V' reduced leaf size only in the Great Dun Fell population, but seed output was reduced in the Bush population. In some cases, giving 3-d episodes of 70 nIl-' had a greater effect than giving the dose every day but the effects varied with the population. This greater effect was considered to be a result of the time it takes for a plant to develop maximum anti-oxidant defence, which is lost when the ozone decreases after the episode. A plant exposed to episodes might have to re-induce defence with each exposure. Although it is reported frequently that ozone favours allocation of resources to the shoot over the root, it is concluded that this is an over-simplification of the response. Even within a species there is a complex suite of responses that varies with the population and with ozone exposure. Describing a population as resistant or sensitive is also an over-simplification."

The U.S. Clean Air Act requires the establishment of ambient air quality standards to protect health and public welfare. However, determination of attainment of these standards is based on ambient pollutant concentrations rather than prevention of adverse effects. To determine if a given AQS protected against adverse effects on vegetation, hourly ozone concentrations were adjusted to create exposure levels that ""just attain"" a given standard. These exposures were used in combination with a physiologically-based tree growth model to account for the interactions of climate and ozone. In the evaluation, we used ozone concentrations from two 6-year time periods from the San Bernardino Mountains in California. There were clear differences in the level of vegetation protection achieved with the various AQSs. Based on modeled plant growth, the most effective standards were the California 8-hr average maximum of 70 ppb and a seasonal, cumulative, concentration-weighted index (SUM06), which if attained, resulted in annual growth reductions of 1 % or less. Least effective was the 1-hr maximum of 120 ppb which resulted in a 7% annual reduction. We conclude that combining climate, exposure scenarios, and a process-based plant growth simulator was a useful approach for evaluating effectiveness of current or proposed air quality standards, or evaluating the form and/or level of a standard based on preventing adverse growth effects."

This study tests a process-based model that predicts the relative effects of ozone on the photosynthetic rate and growth of an ozone-sensitive aspen clone, as a first step in simulating the competitive response of genotypes to atmospheric and climate change. The resulting composite model simulated the relative above ground growth response of ozone-sensitive aspen clone 259 exposed to square wave variation in ozone concentration.

Coupled climate-carbon cycle models suggest that global warming will act to limit the land-carbon sink, but these first generation models neglected the impacts of changing atmospheric chemistry. Emissions associated with fossil fuel and biomass burning have acted to approximately double the global mean tropospheric ozone concentration, and further increases are expected over the twenty-first century. Tropospheric ozone is known to damage plants, reducing plant primary productivity and crop yields, yet increasing atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations are thought to stimulate plant primary productivity. Increased carbon dioxide and ozone levels can both lead to stomatal closure, which reduces the uptake of either gas, and in turn limits the damaging effect of ozone and the carbon dioxide fertilization of photosynthesis. Here we estimate the impact of projected changes in ozone levels on the land-carbon sink, using a global land carbon cycle model modified to include the effect of ozone deposition on photosynthesis and to account for interactions between ozone and carbon dioxide through stomatal closure. For a range of sensitivity parameters based on manipulative field experiments, we find a significant suppression of the global land-carbon sink as increases in ozone concentrations affect plant productivity. In consequence, more carbon dioxide accumulates in the atmosphere. We suggest that the resulting indirect radiative forcing by ozone effects on plants could contribute more to global warming than the direct radiative forcing due to tropospheric ozone increases."

Despite variation in temperature and precipitation over the study period (1963-1999), O3 exposure consistently reduced simulated tree growth. Simulated growth reductions increased concurrent with increasing O3 exposure. The maximum growth reduction occurred in 1979. As O3 exposures decreased during the 1980s and 1990s, effects on growth also decreased. This implies that emission control strategies taken to reduce exposures to attain O3 standards benefited P. ponderosa growth in the San Bernardino Mountains. This modeling approach provides a powerful tool for solving the difficult problem of evaluating regulatory effectiveness by simulating plant response using long-term climate and air pollution exposure records for a given region."

The GIS is used to aggregate factors considered important in a risk characterization, including: (1) estimated ozone exposures over forested regions, (2) measures of ozone effects on species' and stand growth, and (3) spatially distributed environmental, genetic, and exposure influences on species' response to ozone. The GIS-based risk characterization provides an estimation of the extent and magnitude of the potential ozone impact on forests. A preliminary risk characterization demonstrating this approach considered only the eastern United States and only the limited empirical data quantifying the effect of ozone exposures on forest tree species as seedlings. The area-weighted response of the annual seedling biomass loss formed the basis for a sensitivity ranking: sensitive - aspen and black cherry (14%-33% biomass loss over 50% of their distribution); moderately sensitive - tulip popular, loblolly pine, eastern white pine, and sugar maple (5%-13% biomass loss); insensitive - Virginia pine and red maple (0%-1% loss). In the future, the GIS-based risk characterization will include process-based model simulations of the three- to 5-year growth response of individual species as large trees with relevant environmental interactions and model simulated response of mixed stands.

Daily mean ozone concentrations were maintained at 2, 23, 28, 42, and 57 nl center dot l-1 with a regular diurnal pattern of exposure. After harvest, grain yield was determined. Based on visible injury to the uppermost fully expanded leaf, the indica cultivar 'Kasalath' was most tolerant, and the japonica cultivar 'Kirara 397' was most sensitive to ozone. However, grain yields for both 'Kasalath' and 'Kirara 397' were significantly decreased after ozone exposure. The indica cultivar 'Jothi' suffered severe injury after ozone exposure but had no reduction in grain yield. Therefore, ozone sensitivity of rice cultivars evaluated by visible injury did not coincide with that evaluated by the reductions in grain yield. These results suggest that mechanisms that induce acute leaf injury do not relate to chronic ozone toxicity that reduces yield."

Meta-analysis of the ozone sensitivity data showed a wide inter-specific range in response to ozone. Some relationships in comparison to plant physiological and ecological characteristics were identified. Plants of the therophyte lifeform were particularly sensitive to ozone. Species with higher mature leaf N concentration were more sensitive to ozone than those with lower leaf N concentration. Some relationships between relative sensitivity to ozone and Ellenberg habitat requirements were also identified. In contrast, no relationships between relative sensitivity to ozone and mature leaf P concentration, Grime's CSR strategy, leaf longevity, flowering season, stomatal density and maximum altitude were found.

The quantification of such factors represents a step-forward in the derivation of Level II critical levels for ozone. The weighting factors presented are derived from published literature on the sensitivity of wheat (Triticum aestivum), bean (Phaseolus vulgaris) and plantain (Plantago major) to ozone at different growth stages. Weighting functions were calculated using either multiple linear regression or the reciprocal residual mean square (RMS-1). The resulting weights were transformed into multiplication factors to be applied to the monthly AOT40 during the 3-month assessment period of critical level exceedance. Interspecific differences were too large to allow for the development of a unified weighting function for the three species considered. For wheat grain yield, the derived multiplication factors varied by almost four-fold (0.40, 1.06, 1.54), while those for bean pod yield varied by only about 25% (0.85, 1.01, 1.14). The available data for plantain were restricted to short-term studies conducted under controlled conditions. These data were not suitable for the derivation of weighting factors comparable to those derived for bean and wheat. Based on known differences in wheat development and phenology across Europe, the need for a geographic differentiation of the time period for the calculation of the critical level exceedances is also discussed and examples provided of the adoption of the derived weightings in the mapping of critical level exceedances. Differences between critical level exceedance maps using weighted and unweighted AOT40 calculations are discussed. "

Weighting functions were developed using reciprocal residual mean square (JIRMS) or percentage of the best 100exposure statistics of the 163 tested (TOPJOO) for each of the quarters. The third quarter of the alfalfa season was clearly most responsive to ozone as measured by both of the weighting functions. Third quarter ozone was also weighted highest by both weighting functions for dry bean. Fresh market and processing tomato were each influenced the greatest by second quarter ozone as demonstrated by both weighting functions. The occurrence of ozone during physiologically important events(flowering and initial fruit set in second quarter for tomato; pod development in third quarter for dry bean)appeared to influence the yield of these crops the greatest.

We analyze the effect of interstate transport on surface O-3 in each continental U.S. state in July 1996 using the community multiscale air quality (CMAQ) model. By examining the difference between a baseline simulation and perturbabon simulations in which each state's nitrogen oxides (NOx) emissions are removed, we establish for the first time a summertime source-receptor matrix for all 48 continental states. We find that for 16 (20) states at least one neighboring state's NO, emissions are responsible for a larger increase in monthly mean peak 8 h (all-hour) O-3 concentrations than the state's own emissions. For over 80% of the contiguous states, interstate transport is more important than local emissions for summertime peak O-3 concentrations. Our source-receptor matrices indicate that the geographic range of the clean air interstate rule (CAIR) was sufficient to address interstate transport of O-3 in most of the states included in the program.

As such processes may differ among experimental plots there is a risk that effects of experimental treatments are confounded. Here we report on a free-air ozone-exposure experiment in permanent semi-natural grassland that suggested strong ozone effects on community productivity after 5 years. We tested ozone effects and investigated the potential of confounding due to changes in nutrient management. Repeated-measure ANOVA revealed mainly negative temporal trends for frequency of abundant productive plant species. Constrained ordination additionally showed converging trajectories of species compositions for ozone and control treatments with time. Yields sampled prior to the start of the experiment and soil nitrogen concentrations revealed that spatial heterogeneity in the soil nutrient status was not accounted for by the random allocation of treatments to plots with a bias towards less productive patches in the elevated-ozone plots. Re-analysis of yield data using repeated-measure ANOVA with a covariable to account for productivity prior to the start of fumigation revealed effects on the temporal changes in total yield and yield of legumes that cannot be separated between ozone and pre-treatment nutrient status. Changes in species composition favour an ecological interpretation with spatial heterogeneity as the major cause of different yield declines. Although elevated ozone may cause subtle physiological changes with longer term implications, our new results suggest that species-rich mature grassland such as the one studied at Le Mouret may be less sensitive to elevated ozone than previously assumed. In this experiment a confounded design was hidden at the start by transitory effects of a prior change in nutrient treatments."

Ozone was supplied either from 1900 until 0700 h (nighttime regime), from 0700 until 1900 h (daylight regime), or all day (24-h regime). By autumn, reductions in whole-plant biomass production, root/shoot biomass and stem weight/length ratios were evident in all three O(3) regimes. The reductions in cuttings receiving the 24-h O(3) treatment were about twofold larger than in cuttings receiving the daylight O(3) treatment. Stomata were open at night, and stomatal conductance was about 50% of its maximum daytime value. We calculated that the rate of O(3) uptake into leaves in the dark approached 4 nmol m(-2) s(-1). Whole-plant production and carbon allocation were more sensitive to O(3) during the night than during the day; however, O(3) exposure caused similar visible leaf injury in both of the 12-h regimes, although the leaves exposed to O(3) at night exhibited delayed O(3)-induced shedding. Overall, changes in production and carbon allocation were determined by the external O(3) dose rather than by the kind of O(3) exposure, indicating that, at the seasonal scale, the internal dose of ozone that was physiologically effective was a constant fraction of the external O(3) dose. We conclude that nighttime O(3) exposures should be included in the daily time period for determining critical concentrations of O(3) causing injury in trees."

At a given ambient O3 concentration, the rate of 03 uptake by needles was effectively controlled by stomatal conductance and, hence, by factors such as light, humidity and water status, which control stomatal conductance. At both study sites, atmospheric water vapor pressure deficit (VPD) was the climatic factor most closely correlated with ambient O3 concentration. Thus, when ambient O3 concentrations were highest, O3 flux into the needles tended to be restricted by narrowing of the stomata. Mitigation of potential O3 stress by stomatal closure was most marked at the low elevation site where both soil water stress and atmospheric VPD were greater than at the high elevation site. reduced (Komer and Mayr 1981), whereas trees at the timberline are rarely forced to restrict water loss (Tranquillini 1979). Mean O3 concentrations, however, are higher at high elevations than at low elevations (Miller et al. 1993, Smidt 1993). Because O3 injury results from biochemical and physiological processes occurring in the leaf interior (Tingey and Taylor 1982), these facts imply that high elevation forests are more vulnerable than low elevation forests to O3 induced damage. To examine this question further, we have compared total O3 uptake of larch growing at a high and a low elevation site to determine how O3 uptake is controlled by the stomata under field conditions."

Trees at a third site with lower nitrogen dioxide and nitric acid exposure, but greater drought stress, had slightly open stomata at night in early summer but closed stomata at night for the rest of the summer. The three sites had similar background ozone exposure during the summer of measurement (2001). Nighttime stomatal conductance (gs) ranged from one tenth to one fifth that of maximum daytime values. In general, pole-sized trees (< 40 years old) had greater nighttime gs than mature trees (> 250 years old). In late summer, nighttime gs was low (< 3.0 mmol H2O m-2 s-1) for both tree size classes at all sites. Measurable nighttime gs has also been reported in other conifers, but the values we observed were higher. In June, nighttime ozone (O3) uptake accounted for 9, 5 and 3% of the total daily O3 uptake of pole-sized trees from west to east across the San Bernardino Mountains. In late summer, O3 uptake at night was < 2% of diel uptake at all sites. Nocturnal O3 uptake may contribute to greater oxidant injury development, especially in pole-sized trees in early summer."

Here we review evidence that ABA and ethylene, and interactions between these two stress-induced hormones, control many of the responses of intact plants to drought and ozone stress, with emphasis on effects on stomata and shoot growth. We draw attention to convergent signalling and response pathways induced by ozone and drought that can increase production of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and nitric oxide (NO). Stomatal responses to a wider range of stresses and developmental cues may also be controlled via the same sets of signalling pathways. Other hormones, or effectors such as xylem/apoplastic pH or changes in plant water status, also play a role in signalling within and between organs. We discuss the implications, for crops, natural ecosystems and water catchment processes, of ethylene's antagonism of the stomatal response to ABA, against a back-drop of predictions for reduced precipitation and increasing ozone pollution, as part of global climate change and increasing urbanization and industrial development."

We investigated how a 40% increase above ambient values in [CO2] and [O-3], alone and in combination, affect tree water use of pure aspen and mixed aspen-birch forests in the free air CO2-O-3 enrichment experiment near Rhinelander, Wisconsin (Aspen FACE). Measurements of sap flux and canopy leaf area index (L) were made during two growing seasons, when steady-state L had been reached after more than 6 years of exposure to elevated [CO2] and [O-3]. Maximum stand-level sap flux wits not significantly affected by levated [O-3], but was increased by 18% by elevated [CO2] averaged across years, communities and O-3 regimes. Treatment effects were similar in pure aspen and mixed aspen-birch communities. Increased tree water use in response to elevated [CO2] was related to positive CO2 treatment effects on tree size and L (+40%). Tree water use was not reduced by elevated [O-3] despite strong negative O-3 treatment effects on tree size and L (-22%). Elevated [O-3] predisposed pure aspen stands to drought-induced Sap flux reductions, whereas increased tree water use in response to elevated [CO2] did not result in lower soil water content in the upper soil or decreasing sap flux relative to control values during dry periods. Maintenance of soil water content in the upper soil in the elevated [CO2] treatment was at least partly a function of enhanced soil water-holding capacity, probably a result of increased organic matter content from increased litter inputs. Our findings that larger trees growing in elevated [CO2] used more water and that tree size, but not maximal water use, was negatively affected by elevated [O-3] suggest that the long-term cumulative effects on stand Structure may be more important than the expected primary stomatal Closure responses to elevated [CO2] and [O-3] in determining stand-level water use under possible future atmospheric conditions."

How the concurrent increase in tropospheric ozone (O-3) concentration ([O-3]) will interact with rising atmospheric [CO2] to affect C cycling is unknown. A major component of carbon cycling in forests is fine root production, mortality and decomposition. To better understand the effects of elevated [CO2] and [O-3] on the dynamics of fine root C, we conducted a combined field and laboratory incubation experiment to monitor decomposition dynamics and changes in fine root litter chemistry. Free-air CO2 enrichment (FACE) technology at the FACTS-II Aspen FACE project in Rhinelander, Wisconsin, elevated [CO2] (535 mu l l(-1)) and [O-3] (53 nl l(-1)) in intact stands of pure trembling aspen (Populus tremuloides Michx.) and in mixed stands of trembling aspen plus paper birch (Betula papyrifera Marsh.) and trembling aspen plus sugar maple (Acer saccharum Marsh.). We hypothesized that the trees would react to increased C availability (elevated [CO2]) by increasing allocation to C-based secondary compounds (CBSCs), thereby decreasing rates of decomposition. Because of its lower growth potential, we reasoned this effect would be greatest in the aspen-maple community relative to the aspen and aspen-birch communities. As a result of decreased C availability, we expected elevated [O-3] to counteract shifts in C allocation induced by elevated [CO2]. Concentrations of CBSCs were rarely significantly affected by the CO2 and O-3 treatments in decomposing fine roots. Rates of microbial respiration and mass loss from fine roots were unaffected by the treatments, although the production of dissolved organic C differed among communities. We conclude that elevated [CO2] and [O-3] induce only small changes in fine root chemistry that are insufficient to significantly influence fine root decomposition. If changes in soil C cycling occur in the future, they will most likely be brought about by changes in litter production."

Recovery of 13C in PLFAs was an order of magnitude greater for N-acetylglucosamine-amended soil compared to cellobiose-amended soil, indicating that substrate type influenced microbial metabolism and soil C cycling.

Because soil microorganisms depend on plant litter as a source of energy for metabolism, changes in the amount or the biochemistry of plant litter produced under elevated CO2 and O3 could alter microbial community function and composition. Previously, we have observed that elevated CO2 increased the microbial metabolism of cellulose and chitin, whereas elevated O3 dampened this response. We hypothesized that this change in metabolism under CO2 and O3 enrichment would be accompanied by a concomitant change in fungal community composition. We tested our hypothesis at the free-air CO2 and O3 enrichment (FACE) experiment at Rhinelander, Wisconsin, in which Populus tremuloides, Betula papyrifera, and Acer saccharum were grown under factorial CO2 and O3 treatments. We employed extracellular enzyme analysis to assay microbial metabolism, phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) analysis to determine changes in microbial community composition, and polymerase chain reaction?denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (PCR?DGGE) to analyze the fungal community composition. The activities of 1,4-?-glucosidase (+37%) and 1,4,-?-N-acetylglucosaminidase (+84%) were significantly increased under elevated CO2, whereas 1,4-?-glucosidase activity (?25%) was significantly suppressed by elevated O3. There was no significant main effect of elevated CO2 or O3 on fungal relative abundance, as measured by PLFA. We identified 39 fungal taxonomic units from soil using DGGE, and found that O3 enrichment significantly altered fungal community composition. We conclude that fungal metabolism is altered under elevated CO2 and O3, and that there was a concomitant change in fungal community composition under elevated O3. Thus, changes in plant inputs to soil under elevated CO2 and O3 can propagate through the microbial food web to alter the cycling of C in soil."

Soil respiration is the second largest flux of carbon (C) in these ecosystems, and the objective of this study was to understand how soil respiration responded to the experimental treatments as these fast-growing stands of pure aspen and birch + aspen approached maximum leaf area. Rates of soil respiration were typically lowest in the elevated O-3 treatment. Elevated CO2 significantly stimulated soil respiration (8-26%) compared to the control treatment in both community types over all three growing seasons. In years 6-7 of the experiment, the greatest rates of soil respiration occurred in the interaction treatment (CO2 + O-3), and rates of soil respiration were 15-25% greater in this treatment than in the elevated CO2 treatment, depending on year and community type. Two of the treatments, elevated CO2 and elevated CO2 + O-3, were fumigated with C-13-depleted CO2, and in these two treatments we used standard isotope mixing models to understand the proportions of new and old C in soil respiration. During the peak of the growing season, C fixed since the initiation of the experiment in 1998 (new C) accounted for 60-80% of total soil respiration. The isotope measurements independently confirmed that more new C was respired from the interaction treatment compared to the elevated CO2 treatment. A period of low soil moisture late in the 2003 growing season resulted in soil respiration with an isotopic signature 4-6 parts per thousand enriched in 13 stopC compared to sample dates when the percentage soil moisture was higher. In 2004, an extended period of low soil moisture during August and early September, punctuated by a significant rainfall event, resulted in soil respiration that was temporarily 4-6 parts per thousand more depleted in C-13. Up to 50% of the Earth's forests will see elevated concentrations of both CO2 and O-3 in the coming decades and these interacting atmospheric trace gases stimulated soil respiration in this study."

In addition to reducing productivity, increased tropospheric ozone levels could alter terrestrial carbon cycling by lowering the quantity and quality of carbon inputs to soils. However, the influence of elevated ozone levels on soil carbon formation and decomposition are unknown. Here we examine the effects of elevated ozone levels on the formation rates of total and decay-resistant acid-insoluble soil carbon under conditions of elevated carbon dioxide levels in experimental aspen (Populus tremuloides) stands and mixed aspenubirch (Betula papyrifera) stands. With ambient concentrations of ozone and carbon dioxide both raised by 50 per cent, we find that the formation rates of total and acid-insoluble soil carbon are reduced by 50 per cent relative to the amounts entering the soil when the forests were exposed to increased carbon dioxide alone. Our results suggest that, in a world with elevated atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations, global-scale reductions in plant productivity due to elevated ozone levels will also lower soil carbon formation rates significantly."

After 11 years, there was no significant main effect of CO2 or O-3 on soil C. However, within the community containing only aspen (Populus tremuloides Michx.), elevated CO2 caused a significant decrease in soil C content. Together with the observations of increased litter inputs, this result strongly suggests accelerated decomposition under elevated CO2. In addition, an initial reduction in the formation of new (fumigation-derived) soil C by O-3 under elevated CO2 proved to be only a temporary effect, mirroring trends in fine root biomass.

Elevated CO(2) did not alter the parameters evaluated and both elevated CO(2) and O(3) showed no interactive effects on nitrifier and denitrifier abundance, nor on total and mineral N concentrations. These results indicate that elevated CO(2) may have limited effects on N transformations in soybean agroecosystems.

Much work has been done to assess the impacts of these pollutants on trees, but little is known about how the diverse understory flora has fared. Understory vegetation has declined in diversity in response to elevated N in the eastern U.S. and Europe. Six sites along an ozone and N deposition gradient that had been part of a long-term study on response of plants to air pollution beginning in 1973 were resampled in 2003. Historic ozone data and leaf injury scores confirmed the gradient. Present-day ozone levels were almost half of these, and recent atmospheric N pollution concentrations confirmed the continued air pollution gradient. Both total and extractable soil N were higher in sites on the western end of the gradient closer to the urban source of pollution, pH was lower, and soil carbon (C) and litter were higher. The gradient also had decreasing precipitation and increasing elevation from west to east. However, the dominant tree species were the same across the gradient. Tree basal area increased during the 30-year interval in five of the sites. The two westernmost sites had 30-45% cover divided equally between native and exotic understory herbaceous species, while the other sites had only 3-13% cover dominated by native species. The high production is likely related to higher precipitation at the western sites as well as elevated N. The species richness was in the range of 24 to 30 in four of the sites, but one site of intermediate N deposition had 42 species, while the easternmost, least polluted site had 57 species. These were primarily native species, as no site had more than one to three exotic species. In three of six sites, 20-40% of species were lost between 1973 and 2003, including the two westernmost sites. Two sites with intermediate pollution had little change in total species number over 30 years, and the easternmost site had more species in 2003. The easternmost site is also the driest and has the most sunlight filtering to the forest floor, possibly accounting for the higher species richness. The confounding effects of the precipitation gradient and possibly local disturbances do not show a simple correlation of air pollution with patterns of native and invasive species cover and richness. Nevertheless, the decline of native species and dominance by exotic species in the two westernmost polluted sites is cause for concern that air pollution is affecting the understory vegetation adversely."

One hundred and eighty monoliths were extracted from a species-rich Geo-Montani-Nardetum pasture and exposed in a free-air O-3-fumigation system to one of three concentrations of O-3 (ambient, 1.2 x ambient, 1.6 x ambient) and five concentrations of additional N. Above-ground biomass, proportion of functional groups and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) were measured annually. After 3 yr of treatment, the vegetation responded to the N input with an increase in above-ground productivity and altered species composition, but without changes resulting from elevated O-3. N input > 10 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1) was sufficient to affect the composition of functional groups, with sedges benefiting over-proportionally. No interaction of O-3 x N was observed, except for NDVI; positive effects of N addition on canopy greenness were counteracted by accelerated leaf senescence in the highest O-3 treatment.

Herbaceous plants, native to Germany, with tolerance (Anthoxanthum odoratum, Achillea millefolium, Poa pratensis, Rumex acetosa, and Veronica chamaedrys) and sensitivity (Matricaria chamomilla, Sonchus asper, and Tanacetum vulgare) to ozone, raised in the greenhouse, were exposed in open-top chambers to two different ozone regimes, i.e., ""summer stress"" and a normal ozone background. DNA of bacterial cells from the rhizospheres was directly extracted, and partial sequences of the 16S rRNA genes were PCR amplified with primers targeting the following phylogenetic groups: Bacteria, alpha-Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, and Pseudomonas, respectively. The diversity of the amplified products was analyzed by genetic profiling based on single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP). Neither the tolerant nor the sensitive plants, the latter with visible above-ground damage, showed ozone-induced differences in any of the SSCP profiles, with the single exception of Actinobacteria-targeted profiles from S. asper. To increase the stress, S. asper was germinated and raised in the continuous presence of an elevated level of ozone. SSCP profiles with Bacteria-specific primers combined with gene probe hybridizations indicated an ozone-related increase in a Xanthomonas-related 16S rRNA gene and a decrease in the respective gene from the plant plastids. The fact that only this latter unrealistic scenario caused a detectable effect demonstrated that ozone stress has a surprisingly small effect on the structural diversity of the bacterial community in rhizospheres."

The plants were grown according to a standard protocol, and the forage was harvested every 28 days for 4-5 months per year by excision 7 cm above the soil surface. Biomass ratio (NC-S/NC-R) was related to the climatic and pollutant conditions at each site using multiple linear regression (MLR) and artificial neural networks (ANNs). Twenty-one input parameters [e.g. AOT40, 7-h mean O3 concentration, daylight vapour pressure deficit (VPD), daily maximum temperature] were considered individually and in combination with the aim of developing a model with high r2 and simple structure that could be used to predict biomass change in white clover. MLR models were generally more complex, and performed less well for unseen data than non-linear ANN models. The ANN model with the best performance had five inputs with an r2 value of 0.84 for the training data, and 0.71 for previously unseen data. Two inputs to the model described the O3 conditions (AOT40 and 24-h mean for O3), two described temperature (daylight mean and 24-h mean temperature), and the fifth input appeared to be differentiating between semi-urban and rural sites (NO concentration at 17:00). Neither VPD nor harvest interval was an important component of the model. The model predicted that a 5% reduction in biomass ratio was associated with AOT40s in the range 0.9-1.7 ppm.h (A11-1 h) accumulated over 28 days, with plants being most sensitive in conditions of low NOx, medium-range temperature, and high 24-h mean O3 concentration."

Study trees included open-grown seedlings and saplings, forest understory seedlings and saplings, and sunlit and shaded portions of mature canopy tree crowns. Instantaneous ozone uptake rates were highest in high-light environments primarily because of higher stomatal conductances. Low ozone uptake rates of seedlings and saplings in the forest understory could be attributed partially to lower average ambient ozone concentrations compared to the canopy and open environments. Among the tree size and light combinations tested, ozone uptake rates were highest in open-grown seedlings and lowest in forest-grown seedlings. Despite lower ozone uptake rates of foliage in shaded environments, ozone uptake per net photosynthesis of foliage in shaded environments was significantly higher than that of foliage in sunlit environments because of weaker coupling between net photosynthesis and stomatal conductance in shaded environments. The potential for greater ozone injury in shaded environments as a result of greater ozone uptake per net photosynthesis is consistent with previous reports of greater ozone injury in shaded foliage than in sunlit foliage."

To evaluate the potential for plant compensation, we followed the progression of ozone effects, with particular emphasis on the development of new roots. Ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa Dougl. ex Laws.) seedlings were exposed to ozone for 2 years. Following removal of the seedlings from ozone, root growth was assessed to characterize the carry-over effects on new root production, and carbohydrate concentrations were measured to determine if allocation strategies differed among ozone treatments. Four months after removal from ozone, dormant seedlings had significantly lower starch concentrations in stems, coarse roots and fine roots than control seedlings. Following root flushing, starch concentrations in all seedlings decreased, with ozone-treated seedlings containing significantly less starch, sucrose, fructose, glucose and total monosaccharides than control seedlings. There was some evidence that stem starch was mobilized to compensate partially for the lower concentrations of root starch in ozone-treated seedlings; however, there was significantly less new root production in seedlings previously exposed to ozone for 2 years than in control seedlings. Early senescence of older needle age classes, perhaps resulting in inadequate available photosynthate, may be responsible for the reduction in new root production during the year following exposure to ozone. Stored carbohydrate reserves, which were depleted in seedlings previously exposed to ozone, were insufficient to compensate for the ozone-induced reduction in canopy photosynthate. We conclude that there are carry-over effects of ozone exposure on ponderosa pine seedlings, including an enhanced potential for seedling susceptibility to other stresses even in respite years when ozone concentrations are low."

In parallel, increased energy demand for O-3 detoxification and repair was suggested under elevated O-3 owing to enhanced dark respiration. Only in shade-grown leaves, light-limited photosynthesis was reduced under elevated O-3, this effect being accompanied by lowered F-v/F-m. These results suggest that chronic O-3 exposure primarily caused stomatal closure to adult beech trees in the field regardless of the within-canopy light gradient. However, light limitation apparently raised the O-3 sensitivity of photosynthesis and accelerated senescence in shade leaves. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."

Microsites were designated mesic or xeric based on topography and bole growth in response to years of above-average precipitation. In mesic microsites, canopy response to O3 was characterized by thinner branches, earlier needle fall, less chlorotic leaf mottling, and lower foliar antioxidant capacity, especially of the aqueous fraction. In xeric microsites, canopy response to O3 was characterized by higher chlorotic leaf mottling, shorter needles, lower needle chlorophyll concentration, and greater foliar antioxidant capacity. Increased leaf chlorotic mottle in xeric microsites was related to drought stress and increased concurrent internal production of highly reactive oxygen species, and not necessarily to stomatal O3 uptake. Within-canopy position also influenced the expression of O3 injury in Jeffrey pine."

Although there is increasing evidence that communities can be separated into broad classes of ozone sensitivity, the database from experiments under realistic conditions with representative systems is too small to draw firm conclusions.

The aim was to detect subtle effects on leaf chlorophyll and N concentrations, leaf weight, specific leaf area (SLA), and delta O-18 and delta C-13 as proxies for gas exchange. We expected that the species' responsiveness to O-3 and N would be related to their functional traits and that N-induced changes in these traits would modify the species' response to O-3 via increased growth and higher leaf conductance (g(s)). Most species reacted to N supply with the accumulation of N and chlorophyll, but with no change in SLA, g(s), and growth, except Carex sempervirens which showed increased water use efficiency and leaf weight. Elevated O-3 reduced gs in most species, but this was not related to a reduction in leaf weight, which was recorded in half of the species. Contrary to our expectation, the magnitude of the response to both O-3 and N was not related to species-specific traits such as SLA or g(s). No pronounced O-3 x N interactions were observed. In conclusion, since for most species neither N nor gas exchange limited growth, their short-term response to O-3 and N and to their combination was small. O-3 x N interactive effects are expected to be more pronounced in habitats where species are more responsive to N due to favorable growth conditions in terms of nutrient availability and temperature."

In soybean, a nitrogen-fixing species, both limitations are less likely than in crops lacking an N-fixing symbiont. Prior studies have used controlled environment or field enclosures where the artificial environment can modify responses to [CO2]. A soybean free air [CO2] enrichment (FACE) facility has provided the first opportunity to analyze the effects of elevated [CO2] on photosynthesis under fully open-air conditions. Potential ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (Rubisco) carboxylation (V-c,(max)) and electron transport through photosystem II (J(max)) were determined from the responses of A(sat) to intercellular [CO2] (C-i) throughout two growing seasons. Mesophyll conductance to CO2 (g(m)) was determined from the responses of A(sat) and whole chain electron transport (J) to light. Elevated [CO2] increased Asat by 15-20% even though there was a small, statistically significant, decrease in Vc,max. This differs from previous studies in that Vc,(max)/J(max) decreased, inferring a shift in resource investment away from Rubisco. This raised the Ci at which the transition from Rubisco-limited to ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate regeneration-limited photosynthesis occurred. The decrease in V-c,(max) was not the result of a change in gm, which was unchanged by elevated [CO2]. This first analysis of limitations to soybean photosynthesis under fully open-air conditions reveals important differences to prior studies that have used enclosures to elevate [CO,,], most significantly a smaller response of A(sat) and an apparent shift in resources away from Rubisco relative to capacity for electron transport."

The results from free-air CO2 enrichment (FACE) experiments were summarized via meta-analysis to quantify the mean responses of stomatal and photosynthetic parameters to elevated [CO2]. Elevation of [CO2] in FACE experiments reduced stomatal conductance by 22%, yet, this reduction was not associated with a similar change in stomatal density. Elevated [CO2] stimulated light-saturated photosynthesis (Asat) in C3 plants grown in FACE by an average of 31%. However, the magnitude of the increase in Asat varied with functional group and environment. Functional groups with ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (Rubisco)-limited photosynthesis at elevated [CO2] had greater potential for increases in Asat than those where photosynthesis became ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate (RubP)-limited at elevated [CO2]. Both nitrogen supply and sink capacity modulated the response of photosynthesis to elevated [CO2] through their impact on the acclimation of carboxylation capacity. Increased understanding of the molecular and biochemical mechanisms by which plants respond to elevated [CO2], and the feedback of environmental factors upon them, will improve our ability to predict ecosystem responses to rising [CO2] and increase our potential to adapt crops and managed ecosystems to future atmospheric [CO2]."

If so, photosynthetic and stomatal models will require parameterization at each growth [CO2] of interest. Photosynthetic acclimation to long-term growth at elevated [CO2] occurs frequently. Acclimation of g(s) has rarely been examined, even though stomatal density commonly changes with growth [CO2]. Soybean was grown under field conditions at ambient [CO2] (378 mu mol mol(-1)) and elevated [CO2] (552 mu mol mol(-1)) using free-air [CO2] enrichment (FACE). This study tested for stomatal acclimation by parameterizing and validating the widely used Ball et al. model (1987, Progress in Photosynthesis Research, vol IV, 221-224) with measurements of leaf gas exchange. The dependence of g(s) on A, h and [CO2] at the leaf surface was unaltered by long-term growth at elevated [CO2]. This suggests that the commonly observed decrease in g(s) under elevated [CO2] is due entirely to the direct instantaneous effect of [CO2] on g(s) and that there is no longer-term acclimation of g(s) independent of photosynthetic acclimation. The model accurately predicted g(s) for soybean growing under ambient and elevated [CO2] in the field. Model parameters under ambient and elevated [CO2] were indistinguishable, demonstrating that stomatal function under ambient and elevated [CO2] could be modelled without the need for parameterization at each growth [CO2]."

Discrepancy between heights measured for this study and previously calculated heights required revision of earlier allometrically based biomass determinations, resulting in higher (up to 50%) estimates of standing biomass and net primary productivity than previous assessments. Generally, elevated [CO2] caused sustained increases in plant biomass production and in standing C, but did not affect the partitioning of C among plant biomass pools. Spatial variation in net primary productivity and its [CO2]-induced enhancement was controlled primarily by N availability, with the difference between precipitation and potential evapotranspiration explaining most interannual variability. Consequently, [CO2]-induced net primary productivity enhancement ranged from 22 to 30% in different plots and years. Through quantifying the effects of nutrient and water availability on the forest productivity response to elevated [CO2], we show that net primary productivity enhancement by elevated [CO2] is not uniform, but rather highly dependent on the availability of other growth resources."

There were differences in FACE. Trees were more responsive than herbaceous species to elevated [CO(2)]. Grain crop yields increased far less than anticipated from prior enclosure studies. The broad direction of change in photosynthesis and production in elevated [CO(2)] may be similar in FACE and enclosure studies, but there are major quantitative differences: trees were more responsive than other functional types; C(4) species showed little response; and the reduction in plant nitrogen was small and largely accounted for by decreased Rubisco.

CO2 is the substrate for photosynthesis and thus can accelerate tree growth, whereas O-3 is a highly reactive oxygen species and interferes with basic physiological functions. This review summarizes the impacts of CO2 and O-3 on tree chemical composition and highlights the consequences thereof for trophic interactions and ecosystem dynamics. CO2 and O-3 influence phytochemical composition by altering substrate availability and biochemical/physiological processes such as photosynthesis and defense signaling pathways. Growth of trees under enriched CO2 generally leads to an increase in the C/N ratio, due to a decline in foliar nitrogen and concomitant increases in carbohydrates and phenolics. Terpenoid levels generally are not affected by atmospheric CO2 concentration. O-3 triggers up-regulation of antioxidant defense pathways, leading to the production of simple phenolics and flavonoids (more so in angiosperms than gymnosperms). Tannins levels generally are unaffected, while terpenoids exhibit variable responses. In combination, CO2 and O-3 exert both additive and interactive effects on tree chemical composition. CO2-and O-3-mediated changes in plant chemistry influence host selection, individual performance (development, growth, reproduction), and population densities of herbivores (primarily phytophagous insects) and soil invertebrates. These changes can effect shifts in the amount and temporal pattern of forest canopy damage and organic substrate deposition. Decomposition rates of leaf litter produced under elevated CO2 and O-3 may or may not be altered, and can respond to both the independent and interactive effects of the pollutants. Overall, however, CO2 and O-3 effects on decomposition will be influenced more by their impacts on the quantity, rather than quality, of litter produced. A prominent theme to emerge from this and related reviews is that the effects of elevated CO2 and O-3 on plant chemistry and ecological interactions are highly context- and species-specific, thus frustrating attempts to identify general, global patterns. Many of the interactions that govern above- and below-ground community and ecosystem processes are chemically mediated, ultimately influencing terrestrial carbon sequestration and feeding back to influence atmospheric composition. Thus, the discipline of chemical ecology is fundamentally important for elucidating the impacts of humans on the health and sustainability of forest ecosystems. Future research should seek to increase the diversity of natural products, species, and biomes studied; incorporate long-term, multi-factor experiments; and employ a comprehensive """"genes to ecosystems"""" perspective that couples genetic/genomic tools with the approaches of evolutionary and ecosystem ecology."""

These secondary metabolites are well-known for their role in plant defense against insect herbivory. Global change effects on secondary chemicals appear to be plant species-specific and dependent on the chemical type. Even though plant chemical responses induced by these factors are highly variable, there seems to be some specificity in the response to different environmental stressors. For example, even though the production of phenolic compounds is enhanced by both elevated CO2 and UV light levels, the latter appears to primarily increase the concentrations of flavonoids. Likewise, specific phenolic metabolites seem to be induced by O-3 but not by other factors, and an increase in volatile organic compounds has been particularly detected under elevated temperature. More information is needed regarding how global change factors influence inducibility of plant chemical defenses as well as how their indirect and direct effects impact insect performance and behavior, herbivory rates and pathogen attack. This knowledge is crucial to better understand how plants and their associated natural enemies will be affected in future changing environments."

To determine effects of a diet of foliage grown under elevated ozone (O-3), another anthropogenic gaseous pollutant, beetles in the laboratory were fed soybean leaves grown under elevated CO2, elevated O-3, or a combination of both elevated gases. Leaf tissue was also analyzed for longevity-enhancing antioxidants, because increases in dietary antioxidants can increase lifespan. Lifespan of Japanese beetles was prolonged by 8-25% when fed foliage developed under elevated CO2 but consuming foliage that had taken up sugars to approximately the same level as foliage grown under elevated CO2 had no effect on fecundity or longevity. Females consuming elevated CO2 foliage that approximately twice as many eggs as females fed foliage grown under ambient conditions. Consuming foliage grown under elevated O-3 had no effect on fecundity. No significant differences in total antioxidant content of foliage from ambient and elevated CO2 conditions were detected.

Plants grown under elevated CO2 conditions experience physiological changes, particularly in phytochemical content, that can influence their suitability as food for insects. Flavonoids are important plant defense compounds and antioxidants that can have a large effect on leaf palatability and herbivore longevity. In this study, flavonoid content was examined in foliage of soybean (Glycine max Linnaeus) grown under ambient and elevated levels of CO2 and subjected to damage by herbivores in three feeding guilds: leaf skeletonizer (Popillia japonica Newman), leaf chewer (Vanessa cardui Linnaeus), and phloem feeder (Aphis glycines Matsumura). Flavonoid content also was examined in foliage of soybean grown under ambient and elevated levels of O-3 and subjected to damage by the leaf skeletonizer P. japonica. The presence of the isoflavones genistein and daidzein and the flavonols quercetin and kaempferol was confirmed in all plants examined, as were their glycosides. All compounds significantly increased in concentration as the growing season progressed. Concentrations of quercetin glycosides were higher in plants grown under elevated levels of CO2. The majority of compounds in foliage were induced in response to leaf skeletonization damage but remained unchanged in response to non-skeletonizing feeding or phloem-feeding. Most compounds increased in concentration in plants grown under elevated levels of O-3. Insects feeding on G. max foliage growing under elevated levels of CO2 may derive additional antioxidant benefits from their host plants as a consequence of the change in ratios of flavonoid classes. This nutritional benefit could lead to increased herbivore longevity and increased damage to soybean (and perhaps other crop plants) in the future."

We evaluated the effects of 4 h of exposure to air or ozone (0.6 ?ZA?l/L), on two ecologically relevant behaviors of the toad Bufo marinus. Toads were offered five mealworms at 1, 24, and 48 h after exposure. One hour after exposure, O3-exposed toads ate fewer mealworms than did air-exposed toads (Fisher exact test, p = 0.005). Within 24 h after exposure, all toads ate four or five mealworms. Because movement is a key component of toad feeding behavior, we tested additional toads (n = 25) for voluntary locomotor behavior during three 1-h trials in a 2.9-m??A? open-field arena. Mean (??A? standard deviation) total distance moved was: pre-exposure, 29 ??A? 19.5 m; 1-h postexposure, 13 ??A? 15.6 m; and 24-h postexposure, 17 ??A? 17.4 m. The means were not statistically different by repeated measures analysis of covariance. Therefore, our results suggest that a single 4-h exposure to O3 depresses toad feeding behavior after exposure but had little effect on voluntary locomotor behavior.

Exposure of the lizard, Sceloporus occidentalis, to 0.6 ppm ozone for 4 h at 25 degrees C induced 1.6 degrees C of behavioral hypothermia immediately following exposure, but selected body temperature recovered to control 35.3 degrees C the next day. Lizards exposed at 35 degrees C to 0.6 ppm ozone for 4 h selected body temperatures 1.9 degrees C below controls after exposure, and the behavioral hypothermic response persisted and increased to 3.3 degrees C the following day. Four-hour exposures of the frog, Pseudacris cadaverina, to 0.2 to 0.8 ppm ozone resulted in concentration-dependent alterations of respiration including depression of lung ventilation and oxygen consumption and the adoption of a low profile posture that reduced the exposed body surface. Ozone levels in wilderness habitats downwind of urban sources can potentially have stressful physiological effects on wildlife. Defensive physiological and behavioral reactions to ozone exposure may interfere with routine activities, and oxidant air pollution may be in part responsible for observed wildlife population declines."

The effects of O(3) on other vertebrates have not been studied. Compared to individuals exposed to air (N=34), Bufo marinus toads exposed to O(3) (N=32) for 4 h lost 3.78 g body mass (adjusted mean from analysis of covariance, body mass mean+/-SD, 90.1+/-21.90 g). We tested the thermoregulatory responses of 22 toads in a thermal gradient 1, 24, and 48 h after 4-h exposure to air (N=11) or 0.8 ppm O(3) (N=11). Individual toad thermal preferences were also significantly repeatable across all trials (intraclass correlation=0.66, P <0.001). We did not observe a direct effect of O(3) exposure on the preferred body temperatures (PBT) of toads. However, O(3) exposure did have an indirect effect on selected temperatures. Ozone-exposed toads with higher evaporative water loss rates, in turn, also selected lower PBT, voluntary minimum, and voluntary maximum temperatures 24 h post-exposure. Ozone exposure may thus alter both water balance and thermal preferences in anuran amphibians."

O-3 concentrations in the lower atmosphere (troposphere) are predicted to continue increasing as a result of anthropogenic activity, which will impact strongly on wild and cultivated plants. O-3 affects photosynthesis and induces the development of visible foliar injuries, which are the result of genetically controlled programmed cell death. It also activates many plant defense responses, including the emission of phytogenic VOCs. Plant emitted VOCs play a role in many eco-physiological functions. Besides protecting the plant from abiotic stresses (high temperatures and oxidative stress) and biotic stressors (competing plants, micro- and macroorganisms), they drive multitrophic interactions between plants, herbivores and their natural enemies e.g., predators and parasitoids as well as interactions between plants (plant-to-plant communication). In addition, VOCs have an important role in atmospheric chemistry. They are O-3 precursors, but at the same time are readily oxidized by O-3, thus resulting in a series of new compounds that include secondary organic aerosols (SOAs). Here, we review the effects of O-3 on plants and their VOC emissions. We also review the state of current knowledge on the effects of ozone on ecological interactions based on VOC signaling, and propose further research directions."""

To determine which scent-mediated interactions are likely to be affected, we review existing literature to build a picture of what chemicals are commonly found in such interactions and the spatial scales at which interactions occur. We find that pollination, attraction of natural enemies of plant pests, aggregation pheromones, and mate attraction are likely to be affected. We review the scant literature on this topic and extend the hypothesis to include heretofore unexplored interactions. New research should investigate whether air pollution deleteriously affects populations of organisms that rely on scent plumes. Additionally, we need to investigate whether or not breakdown products created by the reaction of signaling chemicals with pollutants can provide usable signals, and whether or not there has been adaptation on the part of scent emitters or receivers to use either breakdown products or more robust chemical signals. The proposed research will necessarily draw on tools from atmospheric science, evolutionary biology, and ecology in furthering our understanding of the ecological implications of how air pollution modifies the scentscape."

They are used by carnivorous arthropods to locate prey. These compounds are highly reactive with atmospheric pollutants. We hypothesized that elevated ozone (O-3) may affect chemical communication between plants and natural enemies of herbivores by degrading signal compounds. In this study, we have used two tritrophic systems (Brassica oleracea-Plutella xylostella-Cotesia plutellae and Phaseolus lunatus-Tetranychus urticae-Phytoseiulus persimilis) to show that exposure of plants to moderately enhanced atmospheric O-3 levels (60 and 120 nl l(-1)) results in complete degradation of most herbivore-induced terpenes and GLVs, which is congruent with our hypothesis. However, orientation behavior of natural enemies was not disrupted by O-3 exposure in either tritrophic system. Other herbivore-induced volatiles, such as benzyl cyanide, a nitrile in cabbage, and methyl salicylate in lima bean, were not significantly reduced in reactions with O-3. We suggest that more atmospherically stable herbivore-induced volatile compounds can provide important long-distance plant-carnivore signals and may be used by natural enemies of herbivores to orientate in O-3-polluted environments."

These VOCs are involved in the orientation of natural enemies, i.e., predators and parasitoids, toward their herbivore prey or hosts (indirect defense of plants). Terpenes and some GLVs are readily oxidized by ozone (O-3), an important oxidant of the low atmosphere and predicted to increase as a result of anthropogenic activity. It has been recently reported that O-3 degradation of terpenes and GLVs does not affect signaling in two selected tritrophic systems. Natural enemies may have learned to use oxidation products that are more stable in nature to locate their prey. To understand the role of these compounds on the tritrophic system Brassica oleracea-Plutella xylostella-Cotesia plutellae, we assessed the preference of wasps to different combinations of cabbage VOCs (intact vs. herbivore-induced and herbivore-induced vs. herbivore-induced VOCs) in the presence or absence of O-3. We found that C. plutellae preferred P. xylostella-damaged plants at 0 and 120 nl l(-1) O-3 to intact plants at 0 nl l(-1) O-3. However, wasps preferred P. xylostella-damaged plants at 0 nl l(-1) to P. xylostella-damaged plants at 120 nl l(-1) O-3. The results suggest that compounds other than terpenes and GLVs are crucial for the orientation of the wasps, but terpenes and GLVs contribute to the behaviorally active VOC blend of herbivore-damaged cabbages by increasing their attraction to them. The products resulting from oxidation of terpenes and GLVs do not seem to play a role in the host location process as speculated previously."

Many herbivore-induced VOCs react with ozone, which is the most important tropospheric air pollutant in rural areas. We used extrafloral nectar (EFN) secretion as a phenotypic indicator of between-plant communication in Phaseolus lunatus L. (Lima bean) and show that an ozone-rich (80 ppb) atmosphere reduces the distance over which signalling occurs. We found that ozone degrades several herbivore-induced VOCs, a likely mechanism reducing communication distances. Direct exposure to 80-ppb ozone did not affect the VOC emissions from P. lunatus. In addition, we demonstrated that high ozone concentrations, 120 and 160 ppb, induced EFN secretion in exposed plants, whereas more moderate concentrations, 80 and 100 ppb, did not. This suggests that ozone can play a complex role in the indirect defence of P. lunatus."

Besides regulating the relationship between plants and their ecosystems, phytochemicals are involved both in resistance against pathogens and in tolerance towards abiotic stresses, such as atmospheric pollution. Plant defence metabolites arise from the main secondary metabolic routes, the phenylpropanoid, the isoprenoid and the alkaloid pathways. In plants, antibiotic compounds can be both preformed (phytoanticipins) and inducible ( phytoalexins), the former including saponins, cyanogenic glycosides and glucosinolates. Chronic exposure to tropospheric ozone (O-3) stimulates the carbon fluxes from the primary to the secondary metabolic pathways to a great extent, inducing a shift of the available resources in favour of the synthesis of secondary products. In some cases, the plant defence responses against pathogens and environmental pollutants may overlap, leading to the unspecific synthesis of similar molecules, such as phenylpropanoids. Exposure to ozone can also modify the pattern of biogenic volatile organic compounds (BVOC), emitted from plant in response to herbivore feeding, thus altering the tritrophic interaction among plant, phytophagy and their natural enemies. Finally, the synthesis of ethylene and polyamines can be regulated by ozone at level of S-adenosylmethionine (SAM), the biosynthetic precursor of both classes of hormones, which can, therefore, mutually inhibit their own biosynthesis with consequence on plant phenotype."

The acute ozone-exposure and spider mite-infestation induced the emission of two homoterpenes, (E)-4,8-dimethyl-1,3,7-nonatriene and (E,E)-4,8,12-trimethyl-1,3,7,11-tridecatetraene, and (Z)-3-hexenyl acetate. Only plants with spider mite-infestation emitted the monoterpene (E)-beta-ocimene. Predatory mites were equally attracted to ozone-exposed and unexposed plants, but discriminated between spider mite-infested and uninfested plants, when both were exposed to ozone. The similarities between ozone and herbivore-induced VOCs suggest that plant defence against phytotoxic ozone and the production of VOCs for attraction of the natural enemies of herbivores may have adaptive coevolution.

Two circles (radii 1.40 and 4.00 m) of Plutella xylostella-infested potted cabbage plants were placed in the O-3 and ambient plots. Female wasps were released into each plot from the center, and observed 5 times over a 24-h period to assess their host location capability. Thereafter, plants were kept in laboratory conditions until larvae pupation to determine parasitism rates. No significant differences were detected between ambient and O-3-enriched environments either in the number of wasps found in the field, or in the percentages of parasitized larvae.

This paper addresses research in which plant growth was regressed for soybean, wheat, cotton, corn, and sorghum against 613 numerical exposure indices using the Box-Tidwell model. When the minimum sum of squared errors criterion was used, optimum performance was not attained for any single index; however, near optimum performances were achieved by two censored cumulative indices and from a class of indices called the generalized, phenologically weighted, cumulative impact indices (GPWCIs). The top-performing GPWCIs accumulated concentrations, used sigmoid weighting schemes emphasizing O3 concentrations of 0.06 ppm (118 microg m(-3)) or higher, and had phenological weighting schemes with greatest weight occurring 20 to 40 days prior to crop maturity. These findings indicate that (1) peak concentrations are important, but lower concentrations should be included in the calculations, (2) increased plant sensitivity occurs between flowering and maturity, and (3) plants respond to cumulative exposure impact."

Exposure statistics examined included peak (maximum daily hourly) and mean concentrations above specific threshold levels, and concentrations during specific time periods of the day. Peak and mean statistics weighted for ozone concentration and time period statistics weighted for hour of the day were also determined. Polynomial regression analysis was used to relate each of 163 ozone statistics to crop yield. Performance of the various statistics was rated by comparing residual mean square (RMS) values. The analyses demonstrated that no single statistic was best for all crop species. Ozone statistics with a threshold level performed well for most crops, but optimum threshold level was dependent upon crop species and varied with the particular statistics calculated. The data indicated that daily hours of exposure above a critical high-concentration threshold related well to crop yield for alfalfa, market tomatoes, and dry beans. The best statistic for cotton yield was an average of all daily peak ozone concentrations. Several different types of ozone statistics performed similarly for processing tomatoes. These analyses suggest that several ozone summary statistics should be examined in assessing the relationship of ambient ozone exposure to crop yield. Where no clear statistical preference is indicated among several statistics, those most biologically relevant should be selected."

In that context with a revision of the UN (United Nations)-ECE (Economic Commission for Europe) Gothenburg protocol, AOT40 values should be replaced by flux-oriented quantities, i.e. in the end by critical loads. At present, the database for the derivation of critical loads for O3 is extremely inadequate. Furthermore, the currently available flux-response relationships are also derived from open-top chamber experiments. The use of a relationship for spring wheat in a risk assessment for an agricultural site in Hesse, Germany, demonstrates in principle, the applicability of the critical load concept for O3. Comparisons of diurnal variation of stomatal uptake and AOT40 showed that a major part of toxicologically effective stomatal uptake occurred before noon whereas the AOT40 values were dominated by the O3 concentrations during afternoon. In other words, the AOT40 exposure index do not adequately address the O3 burden during hours when plants are sensitive to O3 uptake. However, due to the differences in radiation, air temperature and humidity between the chamber and the ambient microclimates, a derivation of flux-response relationships from chamber experiments is likely to be questionable, especially for species rich ecosystems: Here, without any changes in the pollution climate, significant modifications of species composition as well as an earlier beginning of the growing season has been previously observed. To overcome the problems associated with chamber-derived flux-response relationships, a new experimental and modelling concept, was developed. The approach, briefly described in this paper, combines methods in air pollution toxicology and micrometeorology. As an analogy to the free-air fumigation concept, O3 is released into the air by an injection system above the plant canopy. The assessment of dispersion and surface deposition of O3 released is based on Lagrangian trajectory modelling. Depending on wind direction and velocity, atmospheric stratification and surface roughness, without any disturbance of the microclimate and micrometeorology, several sub-areas can be identified around the source position with differing deposition rates above the ambient level. Taking into account the actual O3 background deposition, deposition rates and vegetation responses observed in these sub-areas can easily be used to derive fluxueffect relationships under ambient conditions and more realistic limiting values to protect our environment."

This review is a critical assessment of the scientific basis of the concepts used to define critical levels for ozone and identifies the key limitations and uncertainties involved. The review focuses on the Level I critical level approach, which provides an environmental standard or threshold to minimise the effects of ozone on sensitive receptors, but does not seek to quantify the impacts of exceeding the critical level under field conditions. The concept of using the AOT (accumulated exposure over a threshold) to define long-term ozone exposure is demonstrated to be appropriate for several economically important species. The use of 40 ppb (giving the AOT40 index) as a threshold concentration gives a good linear fit to experimental data from open-top chambers for arable crops, but it is less certain that it provides the best fit to data for trees or semi-natural communities. Major uncertainties in defining critical level values relate to the choice of response parameter and species; the absence of data for many receptors, especially those of Mediterranean areas; and extrapolation to field conditions from relatively short-term open-top chamber experiments. The derivation of critical levels for long-lived organisms, such as forest trees, may require the use of modelling techniques based on physiological data from experimental studies. The exposure-response data which have been applied to derive critical levels should not be used to estimate the impacts of ozone over large areas, because of the uncertainties associated with extrapolation from the open-top chamber method, especially for forest trees, and because of spatial variation in atmospheric and environmental conditions, which may alter ozone uptake."

Current metrics to estimate ozone exposure for forest trees are derived from atmospheric concentrations and assume that the forest is physiologically active at all times of the growing season. This may be inaccurate in regions with a Mediterranean climate, such as California and the Pacific Northwest, where peak physiological activity occurs early in the season to take advantage of high soil moisture and does not correspond to peak ozone concentrations. It may also misrepresent ecosystems experiencing non-average climate conditions such as drought years. We compared direct measurements of ozone flux into a ponderosa pine canopy with a suite of the most common ozone exposure metrics to determine which best correlated with actual ozone uptake by the forest. Of the metrics we assessed, SUM0 (the sum of all daytime ozone concentrations>0) best corresponded to ozone uptake by ponderosa pine, however the correlation was only strong at times when the stomata were unconstrained by site moisture conditions. In the early growing season (May and June), SUM0 was an adequate metric for forest ozone exposure. Later in the season, when stomatal conductance was limited by drought, SUM0 overestimated ozone uptake. A better metric for seasonally drought-stressed forests would be one that incorporates forest physiological activity, either through mechanistic modeling, by weighting ozone concentrations by stomatal conductance, or by weighting concentrations by site moisture conditions."

Both A and Pg generally declined with cumulative O3 exposure or uptake at all sites. As a response variable Pg was slightly more sensitive than A to cumulative O3 exposure. As a metric, O3 uptake vs exposure permitted slightly better statistical resolution of seasonal response between sites.

Stomatal conductance for O3  was derived from sap flux data and AFst was estimated either neglecting or accounting for the potential influence of non-stomatal leaf surface O3 deposition. Leaf-level AFst (AFstl) was not reduced by elevated CO2. Instead, there was a significant CO2 ? O3 interaction on AFstl, as a consequence of lower values of gs in control plots and the combination treatment than in the two single-gas treatments. In addition, aspen leaves had higher AFstl than birch leaves, and estimates of AFstl were not very sensitive to non-stomatal leaf surface O3 deposition.

been based for a long time on exposure to external
ozone concentration. Doses above a selected threshold
(generally 40 nL L21) have been considered injurious,
and the cumulated exposure to these concentrations
has been the basis of the level I approach to determine
and predict ozone damage to vegetation (Fuhrer et al.,
1997).
In the attempt to improve ozone dose/effect predictions,
a more mechanistic approach has been recently
developed. This approach is based on the flux of ozone
through stomata and on the consequent stomatal uptake
by leaves (Emberson et al., 2000). The flux-based
level II approach has been recommended as a suitable
indicator of ozone damage in Europe (UNECE, 2004).
Yet, in only a few cases has a clear improvement of

In this correspondence, it is shown that ozone uptake
is largely driven by stomatal opening, but evidence
is also presented that ozone uptake is not
necessarily related to ozone sensitivity, as isoprenoids,
and probably other ozone scavenging molecules (e.g.
ascorbate; Eller and Sparks, 2006), may contribute to
increased ozone uptake by leaves. Because isoprenoids
have an important antioxidant action (Loreto and

that a part of the ozone uptake may not be related to

reduced ozone damage in leaves."

Reductions in productivity of crops and trees as seedlings are greater when plants are exposed to higher daytime ozone (O3 ) concentrations (0800-2000 hr standard time) or for longer durations. Primary evidence on the greater role of concentration comes from exposure-response experiments where plants are exposed to a series of pollutant concentrations in open-top chambers under field conditions. These studies demonstrate that the integrated exposure indices that give preferential weight to higher concentrations are better predictors of response than mean or peak indices. Evidence suggesting that mid-range O3 concentrations (0.05-0.09 parts per million, ppm) play a greater role than higher concentrations (>0.09 ppm) in biological response could not be justified. The time of day when O3 concentrations and atmospheric and stomatal conductances of gas exchange are optimal is a key to understanding plant response because plants respond only to O3 entering the leaf via stomata. A turbulent transfer model that describes the resistance of pollutant gas exchange from the atmosphere to the boundary layer of a forest canopy, as a function of micrometeorological variables, is developed to determine when flux of O3 is optimal. Based on meteorological and ambient air quality monitoring data at remote forest sites in the United States, it appears that O3 flux densities to the forest boundary layer are optimal during the 0800-2000 hr window. It is concluded that descriptors of ambient air quality for use in setting a federal standard should (1) cumulate hourly O3 concentrations, (2) give preferential weight to day-time concentrations between 0800 and 2000 hr, and (3) give preferential weight to higher O3 concentrations."

However, implementation of this approach requires the development of appropriate models which need to be rigorously tested against actual data collected under field conditions. This paper describes such an assessment of the stomatal component of the model described by Emberson et al. (2000. Modelling stomatal ozone flux across Europe. Environmental Pollution 110). Model predictions are compared with field measurements of both stomatal conductance (gs) and calculated ozone flux for shoots of mature Norway spruce (Picea abies) growing in the Tyrol Mountains in Austria. The model has been developed to calculate gs as a function of leaf phenology and four environmental variables: photosynthetic flux density (PFD), temperature, vapour pressure deficit (VPD) and soil moisture deficit (SMD). The model was run using climate data measured on site, although the SMD component was omitted since the necessary data were not available. The model parameterisation for Norway spruce had previously been collected from the scientific literature and therefore established independently from the measurement study. Overall, strong associations were found between model predictions and measured values of stomatal conductance to ozone (GO3) and calculated stomatal ozone flux (FO3). Average diurnal profiles of GO3 and FO3 showed good agreement between the field data and modelled values except during the morning period of 1990. The diurnal pattern of ozone flux was determined primarily by PFD and VPD, as there was little diurnal variation in ozone concentration. In general, the model predicted instances of high ozone flux satisfactorily, indicating its potential applicability in identifying areas of high ozone risk for this species."

The model calculates ozone flux using European Monitoring and Evaluation Programme (EMEP) model ozone concentrations in combination with estimates of the atmospheric, boundary layer and stomatal resistances to ozone transfer. The model simulates the effect of phenology, irradiance, temperature, vapour pressure deficit and soil moisture deficit on stomatal conductance. These species-specific microclimatic parameters are derived from meteorological data provided by the Norwegian Meteorological Institute (DNMI), together with detailed land-use and soil type maps assembled at the Stockholm Environment Institute (SEI). Modelled fluxes are presented as mean monthly flux maps and compared with maps describing equivalent values of AOT40 (accumulated exposure over threshold of 40 ppb or nl l-1), highlighting the spatial differences between these two indices. In many cases high ozone fluxes were modelled in association with only moderate AOT40 values. The factors most important in limiting ozone uptake under the model assumptions were vapour pressure deficit (VPD), soil moisture deficit (for Mediterranean regions in particular) and phenology. The limiting effect of VPD on ozone uptake was especially apparent, since high VPDs resulting in stomatal closure tended to co-occur with high ozone concentrations. Although further work is needed to link the ozone uptake and deposition model components, and to validate the model with field measurements, the present results give a clear indication of the possible implications of adopting a flux-based approach for future policy evaluation."

This phenomenon was observed in plants grown both with and without supplemental soil moisture, the latter of which should theoretically mitigate against harmful physiological effects caused by exposure to ozone. Seasonally declining rates of stomatal conductance were found to be substantial and incorporated into models, making them less susceptible to the overestimations of effective exposure that are an inherent source of error in ozone exposure indices.

Calculated ozone uptake differed among open-grown seedlings, forest gap saplings, and canopy trees and between leaves in the upper and lower crown of saplings and canopy trees. On an instantaneous basis, seedling leaves had the greatest ozone uptake rates of all tree size classes due to greater stomatal conductance and higher concentrations of ozone in their local environment. A pattern of higher stomatal conductance of seedlings was consistent with higher incident photosynthetically-active radiation, stomatal density, and predawn xylem water potentials for seedlings relative to larger trees. However, seedlings displayed an indeterminate pattern of shoot growth, with the majority of their leaves produced after shoot growth had ceased for canopy and sapling trees. Full leaf expansion occurred by mid-June for sapling and canopy trees. Because many of their leaves were exposed to ozone for only part of the growing season, seedlings had a lower relative exposure over the course of the growing season, and subsequently lower cumulative uptake, of ozone than canopy trees and a level of uptake similar to upper canopy leaves of saplings. Visible injury symptoms were not always correlated with patterns in ozone uptake. Visible symptoms were more apparent on seedling leaves in concurrence with their high instantaneous uptake rates. However, visible injury was more prevalent on leaves in the lower versus upper crown of canopy trees and saplings, even though lower crown leaves had less ozone uptake. Lower crown leaves may be more sensitive to ozone per unit uptake than upper crown leaves because of their morphology. In addition, the lower net carbon uptake of lower crown leaves may limit repair and anti-oxidant defense processes."

The magnitude of this stimulus will partly depend on interactions with other components of the atmosphere such as tropospheric O-3. Elevated CO2 concentrations often lessen the deleterious effects of O-3, but the mechanisms responsible for this response have received little direct examination. Previous studies have indicated that protection against O-3 injury by elevated CO2 can be attributed to reduced O-3 uptake, while other studies suggest that CO2 effects on anti-oxidant metabolism might also be involved. The aim of this experiment was to test further the roles of O-3 flux and antioxidant metabolism in the suppression of O-3 injury by elevated CO2. In a two-year experiment, soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] was exposed from emergence to maturity to charcoal-filtered air or charcoal-filtered air plus a range of O-3 concentrations in combination with ambient or approximately twice-ambient CO2 concentrations in open-top field chambers. Experimental manipulation of O-3 concentrations and estimates of plant O-3 uptake indicated that equivalent O-3 fluxes that suppressed net photosynthesis, growth, and yield at ambient concentrations of CO2 were generally much less detrimental to plants treated concurrently with elevated CO2. These responses appeared unrelated to treatment effects on superoxide dismutase, glutathione reductase, and peroxidase activities and glutathione concentration. Total ascorbic acid concentration increased by 28-72% in lower canopy leaves in response to elevated CO2 and O-3 but not in upper canopy leaves. Increasing concentrations of atmospheric CO2 will likely ameliorate O-3 damage to many crops due to reduced O-3 uptake, increased carbon assimilation, and possibly as yet undetermined additional factors. The results of this study further suggest that elevated CO2 may increase the threshold O-3 flux for biomass and yield loss in soybean."

There is a growing realization that air quality and climate change issues are strongly connected. To date, the importance of the coupling between O(3) and sulfate has not been fully appreciated, and thus regulations treat each pollutant separately. We show that emissions of O(3) precursors can dramatically affect regional sulfate air quality and climate forcing. At 2030 in an A1B future, increased O(3) precursor emissions enhance surface sulfate over India and China by up to 20% because of increased levels of OH and gas-phase SO(2) oxidation rates and add up to 20% to the direct sulfate forcing for that region relative to the present day. Hence, O(3) precursors impose an indirect forcing via sulfate, which is more than twice the direct O(3) forcing itself (compare -0.61 vs. +0.35 W/m(2)). Regulatory policy should consider both air quality and climate and should address O(3) and sulfate simultaneously because of the strong interaction between these species."

In this paper, we suggest organizing the bar chart according to drivers of change-that is, by economic sector. Climate impacts of tropospheric ozone, fine aerosols, aerosol-cloud interactions, methane, and long-lived greenhouse gases are considered. We quantify the future evolution of the total radiative forcing due to perpetual constant year 2000 emissions by sector, most relevant for the development of climate policy now, and focus on two specific time points, near-term at 2020 and long-term at 2100.

One important factor is how natural biogenic emissions will change in the future. We carry out a sensitivity calculation to address the possible increase in isoprene emissions consequent on increased surface temperature in a future climate. The changes in ozone are significant but depend crucially on the background chemical regime. In these calculations, we find that increased isoprene will increase ozone in the Northern Hemisphere but decrease ozone in the tropics.

A highly specific mechanism must be present in the thrips visual system in order to detect this narrow band of solar radiation, which is at least 30 times less abundant than the UV-A (315-400 nm), to which many insects are sensitive. We constructed an action spectrum of thrips responses to light by studying their behavioural reactions to monochromatic irradiation under confinement conditions. Thrips were maximally sensitive to wavelengths between 290 and 330 nm; human-visible wavelengths (lambda >or= 400 nm) failed to elicit any response. All but six ommatidia of the thrips compound eye were highly fluorescent when exposed to UV-A of wavelengths longer than 330 nm. We hypothesized that the fluorescent compound acts as an internal filter, preventing radiation with lambda > 330 nm from reaching the photoreceptor cells. Calculations based on the putative filter transmittance and a visual pigment template of lambda(max) = 360 nm produced a sensitivity spectrum that was strikingly similar to the action spectrum of UV-induced behavioural response. These results suggest that specific UV-B vision in thrips is achieved by a standard UV-A photoreceptor and a sharp cut-off internal filter that blocks longer UV wavelengths in the majority of the ommatidia."

We first confirmed that the relative UV content is higher in shaded places than in sunny places. We furthermore arranged experimental areas with varying UV contents in the field, where we compared three aspects of male mating behaviour: visual localization of females, female-searching flight and copulation success rate. In all aspects males performed more actively in UV-rich environments: males searched females for longer, approached females preferentially in the shade and copulated there more frequently.

Many effects of UV-B involve the differential regulation of gene expression. The response to UV-B depends on the nature of the UV-B treatment, the extent of adaptation and acclimation to UV-B, and interaction with other environmental factors. Responses to UV-B are mediated by both nonspecific signaling pathways, involving DNA damage, reactive oxygen species, and wound/defense signaling molecules, and UV-B-specific pathways that mediate photomorphogenic responses to low levels of UV-B. Importantly, photomorphogenic signaling stimulates the expression of genes involved in UV-protection and hence promotes plant survival in UV-B. Photomorphogenic UV-B signaling is mediated by the UV-B-specific component UV RESISTANCE LOCUS8 (UVR8). Both UVR8 and CONSTITUTIVE PHOTOMORPHOGENESIS1 (COP1) are required for UV-B-induced expression of the ELONGATED HYPOCOTYL5 (HY5) transcription factor, which plays a central role in the regulation of genes involved in photomorphogenic UV-B responses."

Using the uvr8 mutant, we defined genetically distinct UVR8-dependent and UVR8-independent pathways that stimulate different sets of genes in mature Arabidopsis leaf tissue. Both pathways operate at 1 micromol m(-2) s(-1) UV-B and above, but the UVR8-dependent pathway is able to stimulate UV-protective genes even in response to 0.1 micromol m(-2) s(-1) UV-B. Both pathways function in mutants lacking phytochromes, cryptochromes, or phototropins. Genes encoding the ELONGATED HYPOCOTYL5 (HY5) and HY5 HOMOLOG (HYH) transcription factors are induced at low UV-B fluence rates (0.1 micromol m(-2) s(-1)). Experiments with hy5 and hyh mutants reveal that both these factors mediate responses of the UVR8-dependent pathway, acting with partial or complete redundancy to stimulate expression of particular genes. Furthermore, evidence is presented that all UVR8 pathway genes are likely to be regulated by HY5/HYH and that these transcription factors do not mediate UV-B responses independent of UVR8. Finally, we highlight the functions of HY5 and HYH in UV protection and show that HY5 plays the more critical role. This research provides evidence that, in UV-B signaling, UVR8, HY5, and HYH act together in a photoregulatory pathway and demonstrates a new role for HYH in UV-B responses."

CPD photolyase, which rapidly repairs CPDs, is essential for plant survival under sunlight containing UVB. Our earlier results that the transcription of the cucumber CPD photolyase gene (CsPHR) was activated by light have prompted us to propose that this light-driven transcriptional activation would allow plants to meet the need of the photolyase activity upon challenges of UVB from sunlight. However, molecular mechanisms underlying the light-dependent transcriptional activation of CsPHR were unknown. In order to understand spectroscopic aspects of the plant response, we investigated the wavelength-dependence (action spectra) of the light-dependent transcriptional activation of CsPHR. In both cucumber seedlings and transgenic Arabidopsis seedlings expressing reporter genes under the control of the CsPHR promoter, the action spectra exhibited the most predominant peak in the long-wavelength UVB waveband (around 310 nm). In addition, a 95-bp cis-acting region in the CsPHR promoter was identified to be essential for the UVB-driven transcriptional activation of CsPHR. Thus, we concluded that the photoperception of long-wavelength UVB by UVB photoreceptor(s) led to the induction of the CsPHR transcription via a conserved cis-acting element."

In this study, alkali extraction of cell wall-bound phenolics, combined with methanol extraction of soluble phenolics, was used to determine whether cell wall-bound UV screens explain the greater UV tolerance of C. purpureus. The combined pool of UV screens was similar in B. pseudotriquetrum and C. purpureus, but whilst B. pseudotriquetrum had almost equal concentrations of MeOH-soluble and alkali-extractable cell wall-bound UV-screening compounds, in C. purpureus the concentration of cell wall-bound screening compounds was six times higher than the concentration of MeOH-soluble UV screens. The Antarctic endemic Schistidium antarctici possessed half the combined pool of UV screens of the other species but, as in C. purpureus, these were predominantly cell wall bound. Confocal microscopy confirmed the localization of UV screens in each species. Greater investment in cell wall-bound UV screens offers C. purpureus a more spatially uniform, and potentially more effective, UV screen. Schistidium antarctici has the lowest UV-screening potential, indicating that this species may be disadvantaged under continuing springtime ozone depletion. Cell wall compounds have not previously been quantified in bryophytes but may be an important component of the UV defences of lower plants."

The growth, condition and immune function of the salmon were quantified after treatments. Exposure to enhanced UVB radiation retarded growth, and decreased hematocrit value and plasma protein concentration. Further, enhanced UVB radiation affected plasma immunoglobulin concentration. The results demonstrate that juvenile Atlantic salmon are not able to fully adapt to increased ambient UVB levels in long-term exposures, and the interference with immune system function suggests a negative effect of UVB on disease resistance in Atlantic salmon."

Despite international agreements to phase out harmful ODSs, these substances are persistent, and even under the most optimistic scenarios, stratospheric ozone levels will not return to pre-1980 levels for several decades. Furthermore, climate change may enhance chemical stratospheric ozone depletion. Global phenomena such as climate change, ozone depletion, and acidification of aquatic ecosystems interact to modify dissolved organic carbon levels in aquatic systems, thereby increasing the penetration of UVBR. Since amphibians inhabit both aquatic and terrestrial habitats and have unshelled eggs and permeable skin, they are vulnerable to changes in environmental conditions and habitat quality. Increased exposure of amphibians to UVBR can produce lethal and sublethal effects, especially in individuals that do not possess adequate defense mechanisms to protect themselves. In this article, we discuss worldwide increases in UVBR and the adverse effects of UVBR exposure on amphibians. Specifically, studies on the effects of UVBR on amphibian development and metamorphosis are summarized, and possible mechanisms of thyroid system disruption caused by UVBR exposure are considered."

As the UV-B dose increases with altitude, it has been suggested that high-altitude populations may have an increased tolerance to high levels of UV-B radiation as compared to lowland populations. We tested this hypothesis with the common frog (Rana temporaria) by comparing populations from nine altitudes (from 333 to 2450 in above sea level). Eggs collected in the field were used for laboratory experiments, i.e., exposed to high levels of artificial UV-B radiation. Eggs were reared at 14 +/- 2 degrees C and exposed to UV treatments until hatching. Embryonic developmental rates increased strongly and linearly with increasing altitude, suggesting a genetic capacity for faster development in highland than lowland eggs. Body length at hatching varied significantly with UV-B treatments, being lower when eggs developed under direct UV-B exposure. Body length at hatching also increased as the altitude of populations increased, but UV-B exposure times were shorter as altitude of population increased. However, the body length difference between exposed and non-exposed individuals in each population decreased as altitude of populations increased, suggesting a costly effect of UV exposure on growth. Type of UV exposure did not influence the mean rates of embryonic mortality and deformity, but both mortality and deformity rates increased as the altitude of populations increased (while UV-B exposure duration decreased). The effect of UV-B on body length at hatching, mortality, and deformities suggests that the sensitivity to UV-B varied among populations along the altitudinal gradient. These results are discussed in evolutionary terms, specifically the potential of R. temporaria high-altitude populations to develop local genetic adaptation to high levels of UV-B.

A further area of highly interesting research emphasizes the importance of indirect UV radiation effects on plants, pathogens, herbivoics, soil microbes and ecosystem processes below the surface. Although photosynthesis of higher plants and mosses is seldom affected by enhanced or reduced UV-B radiation in most field studies, effects on growth and morphology (form) of higher plants and mosses are often manifested. This can lead to small reductions in shoot production and changes in the competitive balance of different species. Fungi and bacteria are generally more sensitive to damage by UV-B radiation than are higher plants. However, the species differ in their UV-B radiation sensitivity to damage, some being affected while others may be very tolerant. This can lead to changes in species composition of microbial communities with subsequent influences on processes such as litter decomposition. Changes in plant chemical composition are commonly reported due to UV-B manipulations (either enhancement or attenuation of UV-B in sunlight) and may lead to substantial reductions in consumption of plant tissues by insects. Although sunlight does not penetrate significantly into soils, the biomass and morphology of plant root systems of plants can be modified to a much greater degree than plant shoots. Root mass can exhibit sizeable declines with more UV-B. Also, UV-B-induced changes in soil microbial communities and biomass, as well as altered populations of small invertebrates have been reported and these changes have important implications for mineral nutrient cycling in the soil. Many new developments in understanding the underlying mechanisms mediating plant response to UV-B radiation have emerged. This new information is helpful in understanding common responses of plants to UV-B radiation, such as diminished growth, acclimation responses of plants to UV-B radiation and interactions of plants with consumer organisms such as insects and plant pathogens. The response to UV-B radiation involves both the initial stimulus by solar radiation and transmission of signals within the plants. Resulting changes in gene expression induced by these signals may have elements in common with those elicited by other environmental factors, and generate overlapping functional (including acclimation) responses. Concurrent responses of terrestrial systems to the combination of enhanced UV-B radiation and other global change factors (increased temperature, CO,, available nitrogen and altered precipitation) are less well understood. Studies of individual plant responses to combinations of factors indicate that plant growth can be augmented by higher CO, levels, yet many of the effects of UV-B radiation are usually not ameliorated by the elevated CO,. UV-B radiation often increases both plant frost tolerance and survival under extreme high temperature conditions. Conversely, extreme temperatures sometimes influence, the UV-B radiation sensitivity of plants directly. Plants that endure water deficit stress effectively are also likely to be tolerant of high UV-B flux. Biologically available nitrogen is exceeding historical levels in many regions due to human activities. Studies show that plants well supplied with nitrogen are generally more sensitive to UV-B radiation. Technical issues concerning the use of biological spectral weighting functions (BSWFs) have been further elucidated. The SWFs, which are multiplication factors assigned to different wavelengths giving an indication of their relative biological effectiveness, are critical to the proper conduct and interpretation of experiments in which organisms are exposed to UV radiation, both in. the field and in controlled environment facilities. The characteristics of BSWFs vary considerably among different plant processes, such as growth, DNA damage, oxidative damage and induction of changes in secondary chemicals. Thus, use of a single BSWF for plant or ecosystem response is not appropriate. This brief review emphasizes progress since the previous report toward the understanding of solar ultraviolet radiation effects on terrestrial systems as it relates to ozone column reduction and the interaction of climate change factors."

The effects of UV-B (280-315 nm), which ate dependent on the stratospheric ozone layer, on biogeochemical cycles are often linked to concurrent exposure to UV-A radiation (315-400 nm), which is influenced by global climate change. These interactions involving UV radiation (the combination of UV-B and UV-A) are central to the prediction and evaluation of future Earth environmental conditions. There is increasing evidence that elevated UV-B radiation has significant effects on the terrestrial biosphere with implications for the cycling of carbon, nitrogen and other elements. The cycling of carbon and inorganic nutrients such as nitrogen can be affected by UV-B-mediated changes in communities of soil organisms, probably due to the effects of UV-B radiation on plant root exudation and/or the chemistry of dead plant material falling to the soil. In and environments direct photodegraclation can play a major role in the decay of plant litter, and UV-B radiation is responsible for a significant part of this photodegraclation. UV-B radiation strongly influences aquatic carbon, nitrogen, sulfur and metals cycling that affect a wide range of life processes. UV-B radiation changes the biological availability of dissolved organic matter to microorganisms, and accelerates its transformation into dissolved inorganic carbon and nitrogen, including carbon dioxide and ammonium. The coloured part of dissolved organic matter (CDOM) controls the penetration of UV radiation into water bodies, but CDOM is also photodegraded by solar UV radiation. Changes in CDOM influence the penetration of UV radiation into water bodies with major consequences for aquatic biogeochemical processes. Changes in aquatic primary productivity and decomposition due to climate-related changes in circulation and nutrient supply occur concurrently with exposure to increased UV-B radiation, and have synergistic effects on the penetration of light into aquatic: ecosystems. Future changes in climate will enhance stratification of lakes and the ocean, which will intensify photodegradation of CDOM by UV radiation. The resultant increase in the transparency of water bodies may increase UV-B effects on aquatic biogeochemistry in the surface layer. Changing solar UV radiation and climate also interact to influence exchanges of trace gases, such as halocarbons (e.g., methyl bromide) which influence ozone depletion, and sulfur gases (e.g., dimethylsulfide) that oxidize to produce sulfate aerosols that cool the marine atmosphere. UV radiation affects the biological availability of iron, copper and other trace metals in aquatic environments thus potentially affecting metal toxicity and the growth of phytoplankton and other microorganisms that are involved in carbon and nitrogen cycling. Future changes in ecosystem distribution due to alterations in the physical and chemical climate interact with ozone-modulated changes in UV-B radiation. These interactions between the effects of climate change and UV-B radiation on biogeochemical cycles in terrestrial and aquatic, systems may partially offset the beneficial effects of an ozone recovery."

Cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (CPDs) and (6-4) photoproducts [(6-4)PDs] were quantified in DNA extracts using radioimmunoassays. UVB was lowest in the polar regions and highest near the equator and correlations between UVB and DNA damage were observed. The eukaryotic fraction showed significant CPDs across the entire transect; (6-4)PDs were detected only in the tropics. The bacterial fraction showed no accumulation of (6-4)PDs at any latitude, although residual (6-4)PDs were observed. Bacterial cell volumes were greatest in the sub-Arctic and northern temperate latitudes and lower in the tropics and southern hemisphere, a unique observation that parallels Bergmann's rule. A strong negative correlation was observed between cell volume and CPDs.

Solar UV radiation penetrates to ecological significant depths in aquatic systems and can affect both marine and freshwater systems from major biomass producers (phytoplankton) to consumers (e.g., zooplankton, fish, etc.) higher in the food web. Many factors influence the depth of penetration of radiation into natural waters including dissolved organic compounds whose concentration and chemical composition are likely to be influenced by future climate and UV radiation variability. There is also considerable evidence that aquatic species utilize many mechanisms for photoprotection against excessive radiation. Often, these protective mechanisms pose conflicting selection pressures on species making UV radiation an additional stressor on the organism. It is at the ecosystem level where assessments of anthropogenic climate change and UV-related effects are interrelated and where much recent research has been directed. Several studies suggest that the influence of UV-B at the ecosystem level may be more pronounced on community and trophic level structure, and hence on subsequent biogeochemical cycles, than on biomass levels per se."

Because the incremental emission controls differ according to region, strong spatial variability in O(3) reductions and in corresponding UV radiation increments is seen. The geographically averaged UV increase is 0.11 ? 0.03%, whereas the population-weighted increase is larger, 0.19 ? 0.06%, because O(3) reductions are greater in more densely populated regions. These relative increments in exposure are non-negligible given the already high incidence of UV-related health effects, but are lower by an order of magnitude or more than previous estimates."

Methane and ozone are also important greenhouse gases. Reducing methane emissions therefore decreases surface ozone everywhere while slowing climate warming, but although methane mitigation has been considered to address climate change, it has not for air quality. Here we show that global decreases in surface ozone concentrations, due to methane mitigation, result in substantial and widespread decreases in premature human mortality. Reducing global anthropogenic methane emissions by 20% beginning in 2010 would decrease the average daily maximum 8-h surface ozone by approximately 1 part per billion by volume globally. By using epidemiologic ozone-mortality relationships, this ozone reduction is estimated to prevent approximately 30,000 premature all-cause mortalities globally in 2030, and approximately 370,000 between 2010 and 2030. If only cardiovascular and respiratory mortalities are considered, approximately 17,000 global mortalities can be avoided in 2030. The marginal cost-effectiveness of this 20% methane reduction is estimated to be approximately 420,000 US dollars per avoided mortality. If avoided mortalities are valued at 1 US dollars million each, the benefit is approximately 240 US dollars per tone of CH(4) ( approximately 12 US dollars per tone of CO(2) equivalent), which exceeds the marginal cost of the methane reduction. These estimated air pollution ancillary benefits of climate-motivated methane emission reductions are comparable with those estimated previously for CO(2). Methane mitigation offers a unique opportunity to improve air quality globally and can be a cost-effective component of international ozone management, bringing multiple benefits for air quality, public health, agriculture, climate, and energy."

Methane control is shown here to be viable for ozone management. Identified global abatement measures can reduce ~10% of anthropogenic methane emissions at a cost-savings, decreasing surface ozone by 0.4-0.7 ppb. Methane controls produce ozone reductions that are widespread globally and are realized gradually (~12 yr). In contrast, controls on nitrogen oxides (NOX) and nonmethane volatile organic compounds (NMVOCs) target high-ozone episodes in polluted regions and affect ozone rapidly but have a smaller climate benefit. A coarse estimate of the monetized global benefits of ozone reductions for agriculture, forestry, and human health (neglecting ozone mortality) justifies reducing ~17% of global anthropogenic methane emissions. If implemented, these controls would decrease ozone by ~1 ppb and radiative forcing by ~0.12 W m-2. We also find that climate-motivated methane reductions have air quality-related ancillary benefits comparable to those for CO2. Air quality planning should consider reducing methane emissions alongside NOX and NMVOCs, and because the benefits of methane controls are shared internationally, industrialized nations should consider emphasizing methane in the further development of climate change or ozone policies."

# Network-based approach

For the construction of graph: run graph_construction.py.

For training and testing classifier, run network_based_LR.py.

Constructed graph and pretrained word embeddings: see graph.gml and emb.txt.

## Some tools used in this pipeline:

Graph construction: networkx.

Unsupervised learning: Node2Vec.

Classifier: Logistic regression.

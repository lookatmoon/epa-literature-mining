Over a 15-year period, 3.2% of males and 4.3% of females reported new doctor diagnoses of asthma. For males, we observed a significant relationship between report of doctor diagnosis of asthma and 20-year mean 8-h average ambient ozone concentration (relative risk (RR) = 2.09 for a 27 ppb increase in ozone concentration, 95% CI = 1.03 to 4.16). We observed no such relationship for females. Other variables significantly related to development of asthma were a history of ever-smoking for males (HR = 237, 95% CI = 1.13 to 4.81), and for females, number of years worked with a smoker (RR  1.21 for a 7-year increment, 95% CI = 1.04 to 1.39), age (RH = 0.61 for a 16-year increment, 95% CI = 0.44 to 0.84), and a history of childhood pneumonia or
bronchitis (RH = 2.96, 95% CI = 1.68 to 5.03). Addition of other pollutants (PM10, SO4, NO2, and SO2) to the models did not diminish the relationship between ozone and asthma for males. These data suggest that long-term exposure to ambient ozone is associated with development of asthma in adult males.",4.3.4.1,Personal Exposure to Ozone and Copollutants,3.2.4.1.1,Epidemiologic Studies

We selected two Southern California communities, Upland and several towns located in the San Bernardino mountains, because certain characteristics of those communities were believed to affect personal exposures. On 6 consecutive days during each study month, participant homes were monitored for indoor and outdoor ozone concentrations, and participating children wore a small passive ozone sampler to measure personal exposure. During each sampling period, the children recorded time-location-activity information in a diary. Ambient ozone concentration data were obtained from air quality monitoring stations in the study areas. We present ozone concentration data for she ozone season (June-September 1995 and May 1996) and the nonozone season (October 1995-April 1996). During the ozone season, outdoor and indoor concentrations and personal exposure averaged 48.2, 11.8, and 18.8 ppb in Upland and 60.1, 21.4, and 25.4 ppb in the mountain towns, respectively. During the nonoxone season, outdoor and indoor concentrations and personal exposure averaged 21.1, 3.2, and 6.2 ppb in Upland, and 35.7, 2.8, and 5.7 ppb in the mountain towns, respectively.

The sampler measured simultaneous 24-hr integrated personal exposures to PM25, PM10, SO4 2-, O3, NO2, SO2, and exhaust-related VOCs.

Results of this study showed that longitudinal associations between ambient PM2.5 concentrations and corresponding personal exposures tended to be high in the summer (median Spearman's r = 0.74) and low in the winter (median Spearman's r = 0.25). Indoor ventilation was an important determinant of personal PM2.5 exposures and resulting personal-ambient associations. Associations between personal PM25 exposures and corresponding ambient concentrations were strongest for well-ventilated indoor environments and decreased with ventilation. This decrease was attributed to the increasing influence of indoor PM2 5 sources. Evidence for this was provided by SO4 2-measurements, which can be thought of as a tracer for ambient PM25. For SO4 2-, personal-ambient associations were strong even in poorly ventilated indoor environments, suggesting that personal exposures to PM2.5 of ambient origin are strongly associated with corresponding ambient concentrations. The results also indicated that the contribution of indoor PM2.5 sources to personal PM2.5 exposures was lowest when individuals spent the majority of their time in well-ventilated indoor environments.

Results also indicate that the potential for confounding by PM2.5 co-pollutants is limited, despite significant correlations among ambient pollutant concentrations. In contrast to ambient concentrations, PM2.5 exposures were not significantly correlated with personal exposures to PM2.5-10, PM2.5 of non-ambient origin, O3, NO2, and SO2. Since a confounder must be associated with the exposure of interest, these results provide evidence that the effects observed in the PM2.5 epidemiologic studies are unlikely to be due to confounding by the PM2.5 co-pollutants measured in this study.",4.3.3,Personal-Ambient Concentration Relationships,2.2,Exposure Concepts

For many agents of interest, exposures take place over time and in multiple locations; accurately estimating the relevant exposures for an individual participant in epidemiologic studies is often daunting, particularly within the limits set by feasibility, participant burden, and cost. Researchers have taken steps to deal with the consequences of measurement error by limiting the degree of error through a study's design, estimating the degree of error using a nested validation study, and by adjusting for measurement error in statistical analyses. In this paper, we address measurement error in observational studies of air pollution and health. Because measurement error may have substantial implications for interpreting epidemiologic studies on air pollution, particularly the time-series analyses, we developed a systematic conceptual formulation of the problem of measurement error in epidemiologic studies of air pollution and then considered the consequences within this formulation. When possible, we used available relevant data to make simple estimates of measurement error effects. This paper provides an overview of measurement errors in linear regression, distinguishing two extremes of a continuum-Berkson from classical type errors, and the univariate from the multivariate predictor case. We then propose one conceptual framework for the evaluation of measurement errors in the log-linear regression used for time-series studies of particulate air pollution and mortality and identify three main components of error. We present new simple analyses of data on exposures of particulate matter < 10 ""mu""m in aerodynamic diameter from the Particle Total Exposure Assessment Methodology Study. Finally, we summarize open questions regarding measurement error and suggest the kind of additional data necessary to address them.",4.6,Implications for Epidemiologic Studies,2.5,Copollutant Correlations and Potential for Confounding

The purposes of this study were to identify an exposure-response model for symptoms, to determine  whether response was related to age, and to assess the relationships between symptom and lung function responses to ozone. Four hundred and eighty-five healthy male volunteers (ages 18-35 yrs) were exposed to one of six ozone concentrations at one of three activity levels for 2 h. Symptoms and forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) were assessed at the end of 1 and 2 h. The exposure and response data were fitted by a nonlinear exposure-response model previously found to describe FEV1 response. The proportion of individuals experiencing moderate or severe cough, shortness of breath, and pain on deep inspiration were accurately described as functions of concentration, minute ventilation, and time. Response was inversely related to age for shortness of breath (p=0.0001), pain on deep inspiration (p=0.0002), and cough (p=0.0013). Controlling for exposure differences, symptom responses were significantly but  weakly (correlation coefficient 0.30-0.41) related to the FEV1 response. In conclusion, the exposure-response model did accurately predict symptoms, response was inversely related to age.",6.2.1.1,Controlled Human Exposure,3.1.4.2.1,Controlled Human Exposure Studies

Further, in prolonged exposures, the relationship of body size to FEV1.0 response to a given O3 exposure dose has not been systematically examined. In the present study, 30 young adults were exposed on four occasions for 6 h (during a 6.6-h period) to constant 03 levels of zero (filtered air, FA) or 0.12 parts per million (ppm). At the latter concentration, exercise V(E) was varied in exposures to 17, 20, and 23 l min(-1) m(-2) of BSA, respectively, for each individual to achieve an equivalent ventilation rate, EVR). In the FA exposure, EVR was 23 l min(-1) m2. Percent changes in FEV1.0 for the three 0.12 ppm O3 exposures were significantly greater than that for FA, but did not differ significantly from each other. For the 6.6-h exposures, exercise EVR at or in excess of 17 l min(-1) m(-2), SS values were significantly greater than those observed for the FA protocol. Further, SS values at 6.6 h of exposure to 0.12 ppm O3 for the exercise EVR of 23 l min(-1) m(-2) protocol were significantly greater than for the 0.12 ppm O3 exercise EVR of 17 l min(-1) m(-2) protocol. To achieve a widened EVR, two 1-h exposures to 0.30 ppm O3 with continuous exercise (CE) at a level necessitating an EVR of 17 and approximately 34 l min(-1) m(-2), respectively, were completed by each subject. All postexposure pulmonary function and SS responses were significantly greater for the higher 1-h EVR protocol. In all exposures with significant O3-induced changes in FEV1.0 and SS, it was found that the smaller subjects who exercised at the lowest absolute V(E) had significantly smaller responses than did the larger subjects. These results strongly suggest that for the O3 concentrations and exposure durations used in this study, the effect of V(E) on O3-induced FEV1.0 and SS responses is not body-size-dependent.",6.2.1.1,Controlled Human Exposure,3.1.4.1.1,Controlled Human Exposure Studies

While direct comparison of pulmonary responses to 6.6-h exposures to 0.08 to 0.12 ppm ozone (O(3)) have demonstrated that chamber and face-mask inhalation methods yield closely similar results, no comparative study of responses to 2-h intermittent exercise (IE) exposures to higher O(3) concentrations have been reported. The present study was designed to achieve three primary objectives: (1) to compare pulmonary function and symptoms effects of a 2-h IE exposure to 0.30 ppm O(3) via chamber and via face mask; (2) to compare the pulmonary effects of 6.6-h chamber exposure to 0.08 ppm O(3) to those observed in 2-h IE 0.30 ppm O(3) exposures via chamber and via face mask; and (3) to examine filtered air (FA) recovery pulmonary and symptoms responses following chamber exposures of 6.6 h to 0.08 ppm O(3) and 2 h to 0.30 ppm O(3). A simple regression of postexposure percent change in FEV(1.0) for the 2-h IE, 0.30-ppm O(3) chamber exposure as a function of postexposure percent change in FEV(1.0) for the 2-h IE, 0.30-ppm O(3) exposure with face mask yielded an R(2) of.83. Further, a regression of the postexposure FEV(1.0) response to the chamber 6.6-h, 0.08-ppm O(3) exposure as a function of postexposure FEV(1.0) response to the face mask 2-h IE, 0.30-ppm O(3) exposure (R(2) of.34) was similar to the.40 value obtained for the two chamber exposures FEV(1.0) response comparison. Results of the 1.4-h FA recovery following the two chamber O(3) exposures showed different rates of FEV(1.0) and symptoms rectification that appeared related to the total O(3) dose (product of O(3) concentration, ventilation rate, and duration). More data are needed to clarify short-term recovery of O(3)-induced pulmonary effects and how they may be related to the more abundant data available on the delayed recovery of pulmonary function seen over longer time periods, such as 24 h.",6.2.1.1,Controlled Human Exposure,3.1.4.1.1,Controlled Human Exposure Studies

Daily diaries were compared with ambient ozone levels to evaluate effect modification by demographic and environmental characteristics. Children born > 3 wk prematurely or weighing < 5.5 lb. had greater declines in morning % peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR) (1.8% versus 0.3% per 15 ppb ozone, p < 0.05) and a higher incidence of morning symptoms (odds ratio = 1.42 versus 1.09 per 15 ppb ozone, p < 0.05) than did children who had been full-term infants of normal birthweight. Among children who had been of low birthweight (LBW) or had been premature infants, greater declines were seen among those whose reported baseline medication category was ""no medication"" (3.2% decline) or ""steroids"" (2.7%) as opposed to beta agonists or xanthines (0.8%) or cromolyn without steroids (0.1%). Among the children who had been normal birthweight and full-term infants, the cromolyn without steroids group had the greatest declines in %PEFR (1.3%, versus < 0.5% in each of the other three groups). Nonatopic children also had greater responses to ozone. We conclude that among an asthmatic cohort, children who had had an LBW or a premature birth showed the greatest responses to ozone",6.2,Respiratory Effects,3.1.5.4.3,Epidemiologic Studies
15903,,,,Effects of prolonged simulated ambient ozone dosing patterns on human pulmonary function and symptomatology,"Adams, WC; Ollison, WM",1997,"Because of increased interest in an 8-hour (h) O(3) Federal air quality standard, acute pulmonary function responses to prolonged O(3) exposure between 0.08 and 0.24 parts per million (ppm) have been examined in EPA chamber studies, both in a 6.6-h square wave application and in an 8-h triangular profile application in which the exposure was initiated with 0.00 ppm O(3) and increased steadily to 0.24 ppm during the first 4-h and then steadily decreased back to 0.00 ppm during the last 4-h. These exposures employed quasi-continuous ventilation rates (VE) of about 40 liters per minute (l/mm). However, typical ambient exposures include changing breathing rates and changing O(3) levels that vary both diurnally and as a function of indoor-outdoor behavioral patterns. The latter can be accomplished more readily by a face mask exposure system than in a chamber exposure system. In the present study, 12 young adult subjects were exposed on seven occasions for 6 h (during a 6.6-h period) to both constant and variable O(3) and breathing rate dosing regimens utilizing a newly devised face mask exposure system. Four protocols entailed constant exercise VE (about 40 l/mm) with either constant O(3) levels at zero or 0.12 ppm, or with acute and obtuse triangular O(3) profiles (averaging about 0.12 ppm over 6 h) typical of Los Angeles and New Jersey summer daylight ambient O(3) patterns, respectively. In addition, pulmonary function and symptoms were also measured hourly for three realistic dosing regimens with variable VE and O(3) levels simulating maximally exposed individuals in recent summer camp and outdoor worker studies where activities and breathing rates were continuously monitored. No significant difference in pulmonary function or subjective symptoms responses were observed between the three constant exercise VE protocols in which mean O(3) concentration was 0.12 ppm but the profile varied from constant to acute and obtuse triangular applications. A protocol which employed a constant level 0.12 ppm O(3) exposure but variable work intensity simulating that of an outdoor construction laborer which resulted in a 9% greater mean VE, tended to result in higher pulmonary function impairment than the three constant exercise VE protocols with mean 0.12 ppm O(3) concentration exposure. Subjective symptom responses were similar for these four protocols. Pulmonary function and subjective symptoms responses for these protocols were all significantly different from those observed for the FA exposure. The two exposures simulating VE patterns observed in a child at summer camp and a postal carrier onfoot did not produce pulmonary function or subjective symptoms responses that were significantly different from those for the FA exposure. This was attributed to low mean VE, which was about half that observed for the other four O(3) exposures. It was concluded that less abrupt triangular O(3) exposure applications than that used in an EPA study do not always produce significantly greater pulmonary function responses than those observed in square-wave O(3) exposures at the same mean concentration.",6.2.1.1,Controlled Human Exposure,3.1.4.1.1,Controlled Human Exposure Studies

Exposure of humans to ambient levels of ozone (O(3)) causes inflammatory changes within lung tissues. These changes have been reported for the ""initial"" (1- to 3-h) and ""late"" (18- to 20-h) postexposure periods. We hypothesized that at the late period, when protein and cellular markers of inflammation at the airway surface remain abnormal and the integrity of the epithelial barrier is compromised, bronchial reactivity would be increased. To test this, we measured airway responsiveness to cumulative doses of methacholine (MCh) aerosol in healthy subjects 19+/-1 h after a single exposure to O(3) (130 min at ambient levels between 120 and 240 parts/billion and alternate periods of rest and moderate exercise) or filtered air. Exposures were conducted at two temperatures: mild (22 degrees C) and moderate (30 degrees C). At the late period, bronchial reactivity to MCh increased, i.e., interpolated dose of MCh leading to a 50% fall in specific airway conductance (PC(50)) was less after O(3) than after filtered air. PC(50) for O(3) at 22 degrees C was 27 mg/ml (20% less than the PC(50) after filtered air), and for O(3) at 30 degrees C it was 19 mg/ml (70% less than the PC(50) after filtered air). The forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV(1)) at the late time point after O(3) was slightly but significantly reduced (2.3%) from the preexposure level. There was no relationship found between the functional changes observed early after exposure to O(3) and subsequent changes in bronchial reactivity or FEV(1) at the late time point. These results suggest that bronchial reactivity is significantly altered approximately 1 day after O(3); this injury may contribute to the respiratory morbidity that is observed 1-2 days after an episode of ambient air pollution.",5.3.5,Sensitization of Bronchial Smooth Muscle,3.1.4.1.1,Controlled Human Exposure Studies

17831,,,,Air quality criteria for ozone and related photochemical oxidants,,1996,"The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) promulgates the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) on the basis of scientific information contained in air quality criteria documents. The previous ozone (O3) criteria document, Air Quality Criteria for Ozone and Other Photochemical Oxidants, was released in August 1986 and a supplement, Summary of Selected New Information on Effects of Ozone on Health and Vegetation, was released in January 1992. These documents were used as the basis for a March 1993 decision by EPA that revision of the existing 1-h NAAQS for O3 was not appropriate at that time. That decision, however, did not take into account some of the newer scientific data that became available after completion of the 1986 criteria document. The purpose of this revised air quality criteria document for O3 and related photochemical oxidants is to critically evaluate and assess the latest scientific data associated with exposure to the concentrations of these pollutants found in ambient air. Emphasis is placed on the presentation of health and environmental effects data; however, other scientific data are presented and evaluated in order to provide a better understanding of the nature, sources, distribution, measurement, and concentrations of O3 and related photochemical oxidants and their precursors in the environment.

Natural emissions are responsible for a major portion of the compounds, including non-methane volatile organic compounds (NMVOC), carbon monoxide (CO) and nitric oxide (NO), that determine tropospheric oxidant concentrations. Natural sources include soil microbes, vegetation, biomass burning, and lightning. These sources are strongly influenced by human activities that have led to significant changes in the magnitude and distribution of natural emissions in the past two centuries. The total NMVOC flux of about 84I1012 g of carbon (Tg C) is comprised primarily of isoprene (35%), 19 other terpenoid compounds (25%) and 17 non-terpenoid compounds (40%). Vegetation is predicted to contribute about 98% of the total annual natural NMVOC emission. The estimated annual natural NO emission of 2.1I1012 g of nitrogen (Tg N) from North America is primarily due to soils and lightning, while the estimated 10 Tg C of CO arises from biomass burning and vegetation. Field measurements of ambient concentrations and above canopy fluxes have validated emission estimates for a few compounds from some important landscapes. The uncertainty associated with natural emission estimates ranges from less than 50% for midday summer isoprene emission from some locations to about a factor of 10 for some compounds and landscapes.",3.2.1,Sources of Precursors Involved in O3 Formation,1.3.1.3.2,Biogenic Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs)

Relative to FA exposure, O3 exposure induced no statistically significant changes in cardiac index, ventricular performance, pulmonary artery pressure, pulmonary and systemic vascular resistances, ECG, serum cardiac enzymes, plasma catecholamines and atrial natriuretic factor, and SaO2. The overall results did not indicate major acute cardiovascular effects of O3 in either the hypertensive or the control subjects. However, mean preexposure to postexposure changes were significantly (p < 0.02) larger with O3 than with FA for rate-pressure product (1,353 beats/min/mm Hg) and for heart rate (8 beats/min); these responses were not significantly different between the hypertensive and the control subjects. Significant O3 effects were also observed for mean FEV1 (-6%), and AaPO2 (> 10 mm Hg increase), which were not significantly different between the two groups.

Outcomes included the incidence and prevalence of asthma attacks, nocturnal cough, supplementary use of beta2-agonists, symptoms of airway irritation, and peak expiratory flow (PEF) value and its variability. The statistical methods controlled for the lack of independence between daily health outcomes, temporal trends and pollen and weather conditions. Black smoke and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) were associated with increases in the occurrence of nocturnal cough and respiratory infections. Ozone (O3) was associated with an increase in the occurrence of asthma attacks and respiratory infections and with changes in lung function, as shown by an increase in PEF variability and a decrease in PEF.

O3 levels had a greater effect on additional bronchodilator use and on irritations of the eyes, nose and throat on days on which no steroids were used. Particulate matter was associated with eye irritation only. This study showed that, although within international air quality standards, the prevailing levels of photo-oxidant and particulate pollution in spring and early summer had measurable short-term effects on children with mild-to-moderate asthma.",6.2.1.2,Epidemiology,3.1.1.2,The Role of Season and Temperature on Ozone Associations with Respiratory Health Effects

Cells and fluids obtainable through bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) were examined after exposure to 18O3 to determine whether excess 18O concentrations (presumed to be reaction products of 18O3) could be detected and equated to the O3 dose to the lung. Three O3 effect measurements (increased BAL protein and neutrophils and decreased BAL macrophages) were also made in subjects or animals exposed in parallel to determine whether there was a correspondence between dose and effect measurements. Eight human male volunteers 18 to 35 yr of age were exposed to 18O3 (0.4 ppm for 2 h) with 15-min alternating periods of heavy treadmill exercise and rest. Rats (F344) were exposed identically, except without exercise. 18O3 was generated directly from pure 18O2. BAL cells and centrifugally separable surfactant material were freeze-dried and analyzed by mass spectrometer for excess 18O. Results showed that the exercising humans had four- to fivefold higher 18O concentrations in all of their BAL constituents than did the rats. The humans also had significant increases in all of the effects markers after 0.4 ppm O3, whereas the rats did not. Rats that were exposed to higher concentrations of 18O3 (2.0 ppm) had levels of 18O in BAL that were more comparable to but still lower than those of exercising humans. Changes in all of the effects markers in these rats were comparable or higher than in exercising humans. Therefore, it appears that O3 toxicity in resting rats underestimates effects in exercising humans because rats have a lower than expected dose of O3 to the distal lung. The dose and effect linkage between rats and human should improve extrapolation of animal toxicity data to humans.",5.5.1,Interspecies Dosimetry,3.1.2,"Population, Exposure, Comparison, Outcome, and Study Design (PECOS) Tool"

The objective of this study was to determine the extent of pulmonary function decrements, respiratory discomfort, and increased airway reactivity to methacholine induced by exposure to O3 below 0.12 ppm. Separate 6.6-h chamber exposures to 0.00, 0.08, 0.10, and 0.12 ppm O3 included six 50-min periods of moderate exercise (E = 39 L/min, HR ? 115 bpm, and O2 = 1.5 L/min). Each exercise period was followed by 10 min of rest. A 35-min lunch break was included midway through the exposure. Although not intended as an exact simulation, the overall duration, intensity, and metabolic requirements of the exercise performed were representative of a day of moderate to heavy work or play. Preexposure FEV1 averaged 4.39 L, and essentially no change (+0.03 L) occurred with exposure to 0.00 ppm O3. Significant decreases (p < 0.01) of ?0.31, ?0.30, and ?0.54 L were observed with exposures to 0.08, 0.10, and 0.12 ppm, respectively.

Over a 3-wk period (June-July 1987) children who were attending a summer camp in the San Bernardino mountains of California performed spirometry up to three times per day during their stay at the camp. A total of 43 children were tested a total of 461 times. Ozone, oxides of nitrogen, sulfur dioxide, temperature, and relative humidity were measured continuously. Daily average measurements of total suspended particulate and the PM10 particulate fraction (less than or equal to 10 microns) were also made. Hourly ozone concentrations at the time of testing varied between 20 and 245 ppb. Regressions of each individual's FEV1 and FVC supported the view that high ozone levels reduced these lung function parameters. The average regression coefficient for FEV1 on ozone was -0.39 ml/ppb (SEM = 0.12) and for FVC -0.44 ml/ppb (SEM = 0.15), both of which were significantly different from zero. Statistical allowance for temperature and humidity increased the magnitude of these slopes. Nitrogen dioxide never exceeded 40 ppb during the time of testing and averaged 13 ppb. Sulfur dioxide's highest measurement was 8 ppb and often was at the limit of detection. Neither NO2 nor SO2 was considered in the statistical modeling. Data were divided based on whether each subject had been exposed to levels of ozone in excess of the National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS) during the several hours previous to being tested. Exposures exceeding the NAAQS indicated a significant negative relationship between ozone and FEV1, FVC, and PEFR. Data for nonexceedance periods did not indicate this negative relationship for any of the three lung function parameters, but it could not be determined if this was due to an absence of an ozone effect or to a combination of the increased variability and decreased size of this data subset. These data indicate that lung function changes on a daily basis relate in a negative fashion to ambient ozone levels. The magnitude of the changes are small and are reversed as ambient ozone decreases.",6.2.1.2,Epidemiology,3.1.4.1.3,Epidemiologic Studies

However, the results of a 6.6-h face-mask exposure to 0.08 ppm O3, compared to some previous chamber exposure study results, revealed several small incongruities that may be due primarily to high individual subject ""noise"" in responses to a relatively low O3 exposure. To resolve these differences, it was the primary purpose of this study to compare chamber exposure responses to those elicited via face-mask exposure to 0.08 ppm O3 for 6.6 h with subjects serving as their own controls. Two types of O3 exposure patterns were used: (1) the usual square-wave profile, and (2) an acute triangular profile, in which O3 concentration was increased each hour from 0.03 ppm to 0.15 ppm during h 4 and then decreased each hour to 0.05 ppm (mean = 0.08 ppm). Thirty young adults (15 of each gender) served as subjects. The two exposure methods (i.e., face mask and chamber) yielded near identical total inhaled O3 doses in both the square-wave and triangular exposure profiles, and produced very similar postexposure pulmonary function, symptoms, and exercise ventilatory pattern responses. However, pulmonary function and symptoms responses became statistically significant from preexposure at the end of h 4 (when [O3] = 0.15 ppm) in the triangular protocols, but not until h 6 in the square-wave protocols.

This background is defined as those concentrations that would exist in the absence of North American emissions. Lefohn et al. [2001] have argued that frequent occurrences of O3 concentrations above 50-60 ppbv at remote northern U.S. sites in spring are of stratospheric origin, challenging the EPA background estimate and implying that the current O3 standard (84 ppbv, 8-hour average) may be unattainable. We show that a 3-D global model of tropospheric chemistry reproduces much of the observed variability in U.S. surface O3 concentrations, including the springtime high-O3 events, with only a minor stratospheric contribution (always <20 ppbv). We conclude that the previous interpretations of a stratospheric source for these events underestimated the role of regional and hemispheric pollution. While stratospheric intrusions might occasionally elevate surface O3 at high-altitude sites, our results indicate that these events are rare and would not compromise the O3 air quality standard. We find that the O3 background is generally 15-35 ppbv, with some incidences of 40-50 ppbv in the west in spring at high-elevation sites (>2 km). It declines from spring to summer and further decreases during O3 pollution episodes. The 40 ppbv background assumed by EPA thus actually underestimates the risk associated with O3 during polluted conditions. A better definition would represent background as a function of season, altitude, and total surface O3 concentration. Natural O3 levels are typically 10-25 ppbv and never exceed 40 ppbv. International controls to reduce the hemispheric pollution background would facilitate compliance with an AOT40-type standard (cumulative exposure to O3 above 40 ppbv) in the United States.",3.2.2,Gas Phase Reactions Leading to O3 Formation,1.8.1,Modeling Strategies Applied to Estimate U.S. Background (USB) Ozone

Methods--In this prospective study, we recruited 1759 children (average age, 10 years) from schools in 12 southern California communities and measured lung function annually for eight years. The rate of attrition was approximately 10 percent per year. The communities represented a wide range of ambient exposures to ozone, acid vapor, nitrogen dioxide, and particulate matter. Linear regression was used to examine the relationship of air pollution to the forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) and other spirometric measures. Results--Over the eight-year period, deficits in the growth of FEV1 were associated with exposure to nitrogen dioxide (P=0.005), acid vapor (P=0.004), particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter of less than 2.5 Am (PM2.5) (P=0.04), and elemental carbon (P=0.007), even after adjustment for several potential confounders and effect modifiers. Associations were also observed for other spirometric measures. Exposure to pollutants was associated with clinically and statistically significant deficits in the FEV1 attained at the age of 18 years. For example, the estimated proportion of 18-year-old subjects with a low FEV1 (defined as a ratio of observed to expected FEV1 of less than 80 percent) was 4.9 times as great at the highest level of exposure to PM2.5 as at the lowest level of exposure (7.9 percent vs. 1.6 percent, P=0.002). Conclusions--The results of this study indicate that current levels of air pollution have chronic, adverse effects on lung development in children from the age of 10 to 18 years, leading to clinically significant deficits in attained FEV1 as children reach adulthood.",4.3.4.1,Personal Exposure to Ozone and Copollutants,3.2.4.2.1,Epidemiologic Studies

Exposures consisted of seven 50-min periods of light exercise (V-E = 14.2 and 15.3 l/min/m(2) for ASTH and NONA, respectively), each followed by 10 min rest. A 35-min lunch period followed the third exercise. Following O-3 exposure, decrements in forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV(1)) and FEV(1) divided by forced viral capacity (FVC), corrected for air exposure, for ASTH (-19.4 +/- 3.1 % and 6.2 +/- 2%, respectively) were significantly greater (p = 0.04 and 0.02) than for NONA (-9.8 +/- 1.9% and -1 +/- 1%, respectively). There was no difference (p = 0.33) for decrements in FVC between ASTH (-11.8 +/- 1.9%) and NONA (-8.8 +/- 2.1%). Nine of 17 ASTH experienced wheezing with O-3, while only one experienced wheezing with air (p = 0.004); no NONA experienced wheezing. Six of 17 ASTH requested inhaled P-agonist bronchodilator prior to and/or during O-3 exposure and experienced some temporary alleviation of decrements. At end exposure, however, ASTH who were medicated had greater Os-induced decrements than those who were not medicated. ASTH who had the larger Os-induced decrements had lower baseline FEV(1)/FVC and lower baseline %predicted FEV(1). These data indicate that in ASTH, unlike NONA, some portion of O-3-induced pulmonary decrements experienced was related to bronchoconstriction, and that O-3-responsiveness for ASTH depended upon baseline airway status.",5.3.2,Activation of Neural Reflexes,3.1.5.3.1,Controlled Human Exposure Studies

Although the subgroups of the population that are most susceptible to O3 have not been identified, recent work in our laboratory suggested that methacholine responsiveness might be an important determinant of susceptibility to O3. PATIENTS AND METHODS: To test the hypothesis that methacholine responsiveness is correlated with FEV1 response after O3 exposure, we conducted methacholine challenge tests and O3 (0.20 ppm) and filtered air exposures for 4 h with moderate exercise on 66 healthy individuals. RESULTS: Repeated measures analysis of variance demonstrated significant changes in FEV1 (-0.82 +/- 0.63 L), FVC (-0.69 +/- 0.48 L), and specific airway resistance (SRaw) (+1.5 +/- 1.1 L x cm H2O/L/s) across the O3 exposure that persisted after adjusting for responses to air. Baseline PC100 (the concentration of methacholine that caused a doubling of the baseline SRaw) was weakly associated with O3-induced increases in SRaw (F1.54 = 2.85, p = 0.09), but not O3-induced declines in FEV1 or FVC. There was a weak association (r = -0.29) between O3- induced responses for SRaw and FEV1. The FEV1 responses for O3 were weakly associated with the symptoms of cough (r = -0.37), wheeze (r = - 0.29), chest pain on deep inspiration (r = -0.31), and shortness of breath (r = -0.37), but not with chest discomfort or sputum production. CONCLUSIONS: Although we were unable to find support for our hypothesis, we found, somewhat surprisingly, that respiratory symptoms were weakly associated or unassociated with FEV1 responses after O3 exposure. This finding implies that individuals may experience adverse effects, ie, respiratory symptoms, without large declines in lung function. Conversely, individuals may suffer large declines in lung function without prominent symptoms and, therefore, may remain in an unhealthy environment despite evidence of toxicity.",6.2.1.1,Controlled Human Exposure,3.1.4.1.1,Controlled Human Exposure Studies

The definition of this effect depends upon the study design, disease model parameterization, and the type of analysis. Further limitations are imposed by the nature of exposure and our ability to measure it. We define a plausible exposure model for air pollutants that are relatively nonreactive and discuss how exposure varies. We discuss plausible disease models and show how their parameterizations are affected by different exposure partitions and by different study designs. We then discuss a measurement model conditional on ambient concentrations and incorporate this into the disease model. We use simulation studies to show the impact of a range of exposure model assumptions on estimation of the health effect in the ecologic time series design. This design only uses information from the time-varying ambient source exposure. When ambient and nonambient sources are independent, exposure variation due to nonambient source exposures behaves like Berkson measurement error and does not bias the effect estimates. Variation in the population attenuation of ambient concentrations over time does bias the estimates with the bias being either positive or negative depending upon the association of this parameter with ambient pollution. It is not realistic to substitute measured average personal exposures into time series studies because so much of the variation in personal exposures comes from nonambient sources that do not contribute information in the time series design. We conclude that general statements about the implications of measurement error need to be conditioned on the health effect study design and the health effect parameter to be estimated.",4.6,Implications for Epidemiologic Studies,2.6,Interpreting Exposure Measurement Error for Use in Epidemiology Studies

The study focused on a 2-week episode, 11-24 July 1999, and employed the new integrated and mechanistically consistent source-to-dose modeling framework of MENTOR/SHEDS (Modeling Environment for Total Risk studies/Stochastic Human Exposure and Dose Simulation). The MENTOR/SHEDS application presented here consists of four components involved in estimating population exposure/dose: (1) calculation of ambient outdoor concentrations using emission-based photochemical modeling, (2) spatiotemporal interpolation for developing census-tract level outdoor concentration fields, (3) calculation of microenvironmental concentrations that match activity patterns of the individuals in the population of each census tract in the study area, and (4) population-based dosimetry modeling. It was found that the 50th percentiles of calculated microenvironmental concentrations of PM2.5 and O3 were significantly correlated with census-tract level outdoor concentrations, respectively. However, while the 95th percentiles of O3 microenvironmental concentrations were strongly correlated with outdoor concentrations, this was not the case for PM2.5. By further examining the modeled estimates of the 24-h aggregated PM2.5 and O3 doses, it was found that indoor PM2.5 sources dominated the contributions to the total PM2.5 doses for the upper 5 percentiles, Environmental Tobacco Smoking (ETS) being the most significant source while O3 doses due to time spent outdoors dominated the contributions to the total O3 doses for the upper 5 percentiles. The MENTOR/SHEDS system presented in this study is capable of estimating intake dose based on activity level and inhalation rate, thus completing the source-to-dose modeling sequence. The MENTOR/SHEDS system also utilizes a consistent basis of source characterization, exposure factors, and human activity patterns in conducting population exposure assessment of multiple co-occurring air pollutants, and this constitutes a primary distinction from previous studies of population exposure assessment, where different exposure factors and activity patterns would be used for different pollutants. Future work will focus on incorporating the effects of commuting patterns on population exposure/dose assessments as well as on extending the MENTOR/SHEDS applications to seasonal/annual studies and to other areas in the U.S.",4.5.3,Microenvironment-Based Models,2.3.2.5,Microenvironmental Modeling

Outdoor aeroallergens, O-3, and fine particle concentrations were measured at a central outdoor site, and personal 12-h daytime exposures to O-3 were measured daily. Personal O-3 differed greatly between subjects and was 27% of mean outdoor O-3. In random-effects autoregressionmodels controlling for weekend days and fungal spores, personal O-3 was associated with asthma severity: for a 90th percentile increase in O-3 (25 ppb), symptom scores increased by 25% (95% CI: 0 to 49%) and inhaler use increased by 26% (95% CI: 3 to 48%) over their averages. Outdoor 12-h O-3, but not 1-h maximum O-3, was associated with inhaler use (p lt 0.03).

Ideally, such maps would be based on a dense network of monitoring stations, but this does not exist. Instead, there are two main sources of information for dry deposition levels in the United States: one is pollution measurements at a sparse set of about 50 monitoring stations called CASTNet, and the other is the output of the regional scale air quality models, called Models-3. A related problem is the evaluation of these numerical models for air quality applications, which is crucial for control strategy selection. We develop formal methods for combining sources of information with different spatial resolutions and for the evaluation of numerical models. We specify a simple model for both the Models-3 output and the CASTNet observations in terms of the unobserved ground truth, and we estimate the model in a Bayesian way. This provides improved spatial prediction via the posterior distribution of the ground truth, allows us to validate Models-3 via the posterior predictive distribution of the CASTNet observations, and enables us to remove the bias in the Models-3 output. We apply our methods to data on SO2 concentrations, and we obtain high-resolution SO2 distributions by combining observed data with model output.

The present study was designed to compare the pulmonary function and symptoms of breathing discomfort responses to a 6.6-h square-wave 0.08-ppm O3 chamber exposure to those observed in a triangular O3 exposure profile (mean of 0.08 ppm), as well as to both a 0.06-ppm square-wave and triangular mean 0.06-ppm exposure, and to those observed during a triangular mean 0.04-ppm exposure and to a filtered air (FA) square-wave exposure. Thirty young adults (15 of each gender) served as subjects, each completing all exposures. While the 6.6-h postexposure responses to the acute triangular exposure to a mean O3 concentration of 0.08 ppm did not differ significantly from those observed in the square-wave exposure, forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV)1.0 and total symptoms severity (TSS) were significantly different from preexposure at 4.6 h (when O3 concentration was 0.15 ppm) in the triangular exposure, but not until 6.6 h in the square-wave exposure. Thus, significant pulmonary function and symptoms responses were observed over a longer period in the triangular exposure protocol at a mean O3 concentration of 0.08 ppm. These results support previous evidence that O3 concentration has a greater singular effect in the total inhaled O3 dose than do VE and exposure duration. Subtracting pulmonary function effects consequent to O3 exposure to existent 8-h average background levels (e.g., ~0.04 ppm, rather than those observed in FA exposures) from those observed at higher concentrations (e.g., ~0.08 ppm) represents a means of focusing the regulatory effort on effects that can be controlled. The greatest pulmonary function and symptoms responses observed for a 0.04-ppm triangular exposure were nearly the same as those for the FA square-wave exposure. Thus, results of the present study show that calculating the net pulmonary function effect of exposure to 0.08 ppm with ocorrectiono for FA response, or for that incurred for 0.04 ppm O3, does not result in any statistically significant difference.",6.2.1.1,Controlled Human Exposure,3.1.4.1.1,Controlled Human Exposure Studies

This system has been designed to approach air quality as a whole by including state-of-the-science capabilities for modeling multiple air quality issues, including tropospheric ozone, fine particles, acid deposition, and visibility degradation. CMAQ was also designed to have multiscale capabilities so that separate models were not needed for urban and regional scale air quality modeling. By making CMAQ a modeling system that addresses multiple pollutants and different spatial scales, it has a ""one-atmosphere"" perspective that combines the efforts of the scientific community. To implement multiscale capabilities in CMAQ, several issues (such as scalable atmospheric dynamics and generalized coordinates), which depend on the desired model resolution, are addressed. A set of governing equations for compressible nonhydrostatic atmospheres is available to better resolve atmospheric dynamics at smaller scales. Because CMAQ is designed to handle scale-dependent meteorological formulations and a large amount of flexibility, its governing equations are expressed in a generalized coordinate system. This approach ensures consistency between CMAQ and the meteorological modeling system. The generalized coordinate system determines the necessary grid and coordinate transformations, and it can accommodate various vertical coordinates and map projections. The CMAQ modeling system simulates various chemical and physical processes that are thought to be important for understanding atmospheric trace gas transformations and distributions. The modeling system contains three types of modeling components (Models-3): a meteorological modeling system for the description of atmospheric states and motions, emission models for man-made and natural emissions that are injected into the atmosphere, and a chemistry-transport modeling system for simulation of the chemical transformation and fate. The chemical transport model includes the following process modules: horizontal advection, vertical advection, mass conservation adjustments for advection processes, horizontal diffusion, vertical diffusion, gas-phase chemical reactions and solvers, photolytic rate computation, aqueous-phase reactions and cloud mixing, aerosol dynamics, size distributions and chemistry, plume chemistry effects, and gas and aerosol deposition velocity estimation.

A low-cost face-mask O3 exposure system was developed in this laboratory and found to produce closely similar pulmonary responses to those observed in prolonged exposures by U.S. EPA investigators. The primary purpose of the present study was to investigate the pulmonary function and subjective symptoms effects of 6.6-h square-wave exposure to 0.12 ppm O3 by these two methods using the same group of subjects. In addition, further investigation of pulmonary function and symptoms responses upon 6.6-h exposures to lower levels of O3 (0.04-0.08 ppm) were studied with the face-mask inhalation system. Thirty young adult subjects completed five 6.6-h exposures with six 50-min periods of exercise at an intensity requiring a minute ventilation rate (VE) of ~20 L/min/m2 of body surface area, each followed by 10 min of rest, except following 3 h when the rest period was lengthened for a lunch break. The total O3 doses for the chamber and face-mask exposures to 0.12 ppm O3 were not significantly different from each other, since the additional O3 dose during the 35 min lunch break in the chamber exposure was offset by a slightly lower average exercise VE (i.e., 19.1 L/min/m2). The data convincingly demonstrated that the two methods of exposing young adults to nearly identical total inhaled O3 doses at 0.12 ppm produce very similar pulmonary function, symptoms, and exercise ventilatory pattern responses. On the other hand, results of the 6.6-h face-mask exposures to 0.08 ppm O3 in the present study, compared to similar U.S. EPA exposure study results, revealed several incongruities that may be due primarily to high individual subject variability in responses to a relatively low O3 exposure.

Although numerous time-series studies have estimated associations between day-to-day variation in ozone levels and mortality counts, results have been inconclusive.

Objective: To investigate whether short-term (daily and weekly) exposure to ambient ozone is associated with mortality in the United States.

Design and Setting: Using analytical methods and databases developed for the National Morbidity, Mortality, and Air Pollution Study, we estimated a national average relative rate of mortality associated with short-term exposure to ambient ozone for 95 large US urban communities from 1987-2000. We used distributed-lag models for estimating community-specific relative rates of mortality adjusted for time-varying confounders (particulate matter, weather, seasonality, and long-term trends) and hierarchical models for combining relative rates across communities to estimate a national average relative rate, taking into account spatial heterogeneity.

Main Outcome Measure: Daily counts of total non?injury-related mortality and cardiovascular and respiratory mortality in 95 large US communities during a 14-year period.

Results: A 10-ppb increase in the previous week?s ozone was associated with a 0.52% increase in daily mortality (95% posterior interval [PI], 0.27%-0.77%) and a 0.64% increase in cardiovascular and respiratory mortality (95% PI, 0.31%-0.98%). Effect estimates for aggregate ozone during the previous week were larger than for models considering only a single day?s exposure. Results were robust to adjustment for particulate matter, weather, seasonality, and long-term trends.

Conclusions: These results indicate a statistically significant association between short-term changes in ozone and mortality on average for 95 large US urban communities, which include about 40% of the total US population.

MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Air pollutants were continuously measured in each of the study communities during the 8 years of study follow-up. HMOX-1 ""short"" alleles (<23 repeats) were associated with a reduced risk for new-onset asthma among non-Hispanic whites (hazard ratio [HR], 0.64; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.41-0.99). This protective effect was largest in children residing in low-ozone communities (HR, 0.48; 95% CI, 0.25-0.91) (interaction P value = 0.003). Little evidence for an association with HMOX-1 was observed among Hispanic children. In contrast, Hispanic children with a variant of the CAT-262 ""T"" allele (CT or TT) had an increased risk for asthma (HR, 1.78; P value = 0.01). The effects of these polymorphisms were not modified by personal smoking or secondhand-smoke exposure. CONCLUSIONS: Functional promoter variants in CAT and HMOX-1 showed ethnicity-specific associations with new-onset asthma. Oxidant gene protection was restricted to children living in low-ozone communities.",5.4.2.1,Gene environment Interactions ,3.2.4.1.1,Epidemiologic Studies

Children with asthma in inner-city communities may be particularly vulnerable to adverse effects of air pollution because of their airways disease and exposure to relatively high levels of motor vehicle emissions.

Objective

To investigate the association between fluctuations in outdoor air pollution and asthma morbidity among inner-city children with asthma.

Methods

We analyzed data from 861 children with persistent asthma in 7 US urban communities who performed 2-week periods of twice-daily pulmonary function testing every 6 months for 2 years. Asthma symptom data were collected every 2 months. Daily pollution measurements were obtained from the Aerometric Information Retrieval System. The relationship of lung function and symptoms to fluctuations in pollutant concentrations was examined by using mixed models.

Results

Almost all pollutant concentrations measured were below the National Ambient Air Quality Standards. In single-pollutant models, higher 5-day average concentrations of NO2, sulfur dioxide, and particles smaller than 2.5 ?m were associated with significantly lower pulmonary function. Higher pollutant levels were independently associated with reduced lung function in a 3-pollutant model. Higher concentrations of NO2 and particles smaller than 2.5 ?m were associated with asthma-related missed school days, and higher NO2 concentrations were associated with asthma symptoms.

Conclusion

Among inner-city children with asthma, short-term increases in air pollutant concentrations below the National Ambient Air Quality Standards were associated with adverse respiratory health effects. The associations with NO2 suggest that motor vehicle emissions may be causing excess morbidity in this population.",6.2.1.2,Epidemiology,3.1.5.4.3,Epidemiologic Studies

Under these conditions, an intense, shallow temperature inversion develops in the lowest 100m of the atmosphere, which traps high concentrations of ozone precursors at night. During daytime, photolytic ozone production then leads to the observed high concentrations.

Objective: To assess the impact of ozone and particulate matter exposure on HRV in humans. Methods: Using a cross-over design, 50 subjects (ages 19-48) were randomized to 2-hr controlled
exposures to filtered air (FA), concentrated ambient particles (CAPs), ozone (O3), or combined CAPs and ozone (CAPs+O3). The primary endpoint was change in HRV between the start and

analysis, exposure had no consistent effect on HRV indices. However, there was a suggestion that the dose-response relationship between CAPs mass concentration and HRV indices varied depending on the presence of ozone. This heterogeneity was statistically significant for the lowfrequency component of HRV (p=0.02) and approached significance for the high frequency component and time-domain measures of HRV. Exposure to CAPs+O3 increased diastolic BP
by 2.0 mmHg (SE: 1.2; p=0.02). No other statistically significant changes in BP were observed. Asthmatic status did not modify these effects.

We compare, for Vancouver, Canada, three approaches for estimating within-urban spatiotemporal variability in ambient concentrations: spatial interpolation of monitoring data; an empirical/statistical model based on geographic analyses (?land-use regression?; LUR); and an Eulerian grid model (community multiscale air quality model, CMAQ). Four pollutants are considered?nitrogen oxide (NO), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), carbon monoxide, and ozone?represent varying levels of spatiotemporal heterogeneity. Among the methods, differences in central tendencies (mean, median) and variability (standard deviation) are modest. LUR and CMAQ perform well in predicting concentrations at monitoring sites (average absolute bias: <50% for NO; <20% for NO2). Monitors (LUR) offer the greatest (least) temporal resolution; LUR (monitors) offers the greatest (least) spatial resolution. Of note, the length scale of spatial variability is shorter for LUR (units: km; 0.3 for NO, 1 for NO2) than for the other approaches (3?6 for NO, 4?6 for NO2), indicating that the approaches offer different information about spatial attributes of air pollution.

We examined the potential contribution of exposure to ozone to the risk of death from cardiopulmonary causes and specifically to death from respiratory causes. 

Methods: Data from the study cohort of the American Cancer Society Cancer Prevention Study II were correlated with air-pollution data from 96 metropolitan statistical areas in the United States. Data were analyzed from 448,850 subjects, with 118,777 deaths in an 18-year follow-up period. Data on daily maximum ozone concentrations were obtained from April 1 to September 30 for the years 1977 through 2000. Data on concentrations of fine particulate matter (particles that are 2.5 ?m in aerodynamic diameter [PM2.5]) were obtained for the years 1999 and 2000. Associations between ozone concentrations and the risk of death were evaluated with the use of standard and multilevel Cox regression models. 

Results: In single-pollutant models, increased concentrations of either PM2.5 or ozone were significantly associated with an increased risk of death from cardiopulmonary causes. In two-pollutant models, PM2.5 was associated with the risk of death from cardiovascular causes, whereas ozone was associated with the risk of death from respiratory causes. The estimated relative risk of death from respiratory causes that was associated with an increment in ozone concentration of 10 ppb was 1.040 (95% confidence interval, 1.010 to 1.067). The association of ozone with the risk of death from respiratory causes was insensitive to adjustment for confounders and to the type of statistical model used. 

Conclusions: In this large study, we were not able to detect an effect of ozone on the risk of death from cardiovascular causes when the concentration of PM2.5 was taken into account.

However air quality modeling systems have the potential to alleviate some, although not all, of the limitations of monitoring networks. To investigate this application, exposure estimates were generated for a case study high ozone episode in the Northern Georgia Region of the United States based on measurements and concentration estimates from an air quality modeling system. Hourly estimates for 2268 4-km by 4-km gridcells were generated in a domain that includes only eight ozone monitors. Individual and population-based ozone exposures were estimated using multiple approaches, including area-weighted average of modeled estimates, nearest monitor, and spatial interpolation by inverse distance weighting and kriging. Results based on concentration fields from the air quality modeling system revealed spatial heterogeneity that was obscured by approaches based on the monitoring network. With some techniques, such as spatial interpolation, monitoring data alone was insufficient to estimate exposure for certain areas, especially for rural populations. For locations far from ozone monitors, the estimates from the nearest monitor approach tended to overestimate exposure, compared to modeled estimates. Counties in which one or more monitors were present had statistically higher population density and modeled ozone estimates than did counties without monitors (p-value < 0.05). This work demonstrates the use of air quality modeling to generate higher spatial and temporal resolution exposure estimates, and compares the advantages of this approach to traditional methods that use monitoring data alone. The air quality modeling method faces its own limitations, such as the need to thoroughly evaluate concentration estimates and the use of ambient levels rather than personal exposure.

A recent study provided previously unavailable clinical data for 30 healthy young adults exposed to O(3) at 0.06 ppm.

OBJECTIVES: We conducted this analysis to reevaluate the existing lung function data of the volunteers previously exposed to 0.06 ppm O(3). METHODS: We obtained pre- and postexposure data on forced expiratory volume in 1 sec (FEV(1)) for all subjects who were previously exposed for 6.6 hr to filtered air or to 0.06 ppm or 0.08 ppm O(3). We used standard statistical methods appropriate for paired comparisons to reanalyze FEV(1) responses after exposure to 0.06 ppm O(3) relative to filtered air. RESULTS: Controlling for filtered air responses, 24 of the 30 subjects experienced an O(3)-induced decrement in FEV(1). On average, 0.06 ppm O(3) exposure caused a 2.85% reduction in FEV(1) (p < 0.002), which was consistent with the predicted FEV(1) response from existing models.

exposures have been associated with increased hospital admissions related to
cardiovascular events but to date, no studies have elucidated the potential molecular
mechanisms that may account for exposure-related vascular impacts. Because of the
known pulmonary redox and immune biology stemming from ozone exposure, we
hypothesized that ozone inhalation would initiate oxidant stress, mitochondrial damage, and
dysfunction within the vasculature. Accordingly, these factors were quantified in mice
consequent to a cyclic, intermittent pattern of ozone or filtered air (controls) exposure.
Ozone significantly modulated vascular tone regulation and increased oxidant stress and
mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) damage, which was accompanied by significantly decreased
vascular endothelial nitric oxide synthase protein and indices of nitric oxide production. To
examine influences on atherosclerotic lesion formation, apoE -/- mice were exposed as
above and aortic plaques quantified. Exposure resulted in significantly increased
atherogenesis compared to filtered air controls. Vascular mitochondrial damage was
additionally quantified in ozone- and filtered air-exposed infant macaque monkeys. These
studies revealed that ozone increased vascular mtDNA damage in non-human primates in a
fashion consistent with known atherosclerotic lesion susceptibility in humans. Consequently,
inhaled ozone, in the absence of other environmental toxicants, promotes increased vascular

However, daily metrics of the same pollutant have rarely been systematically compared within a study. In this analysis, we describe the variability of effect estimates attributable to the use of different temporal metrics of daily pollution levels. We obtained hourly measurements of ambient particulate matter (PM2.5), carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), and ozone (O3) from air monitoring networks in 20-county Atlanta for the time period 1993?2004. For each pollutant, we created (1) a daily 1-h maximum; (2) a 24-h average; (3) a commute average; (4) a daytime average; (5) a nighttime average; and (6) a daily 8-h maximum (only for O3). Using Poisson generalized linear models, we examined associations between daily counts of respiratory emergency department visits and the previous day's pollutant metrics. Variability was greatest across O3 metrics, with the 8-h maximum, 1-h maximum, and daytime metrics yielding strong positive associations and the nighttime O3 metric yielding a negative association (likely reflecting confounding by air pollutants oxidized by O3). With the exception of daytime metric, all of the CO and NO2 metrics were positively associated with respiratory emergency department visits. Differences in observed associations with respiratory emergency room visits among temporal metrics of the same pollutant were influenced by the diurnal patterns of the pollutant, spatial representativeness of the metrics, and correlation between each metric and copollutant concentrations. Overall, the use of metrics based on the US National Ambient Air Quality Standards (for example, the use of a daily 8-h maximum O3 as opposed to a 24-h average metric) was supported by this analysis.

We first conducted an n-fold cross-validation of the model using samples of the original EPA data from which the model was developed. We then identified seven more recently published studies with controlled exposures to a wide range of ozone exposure patterns relevant to the current ambient ozone health standard and used the model to calculate the mean predicted responses for the exposure conditions of the individual studies that we compared to the mean observed responses reported in these studies. The n-fold cross-validation indicated good internal agreement between mean predicted and mean observed responses in the original data used to develop the model. The model accurately captured the patterns of response in each of the seven independent studies with a tendency to overpredict the observed responses by about 1 percentage point of FEV1 decrement on average.

Out of 350,000 sudden cardiac deaths each year in the United States, 60,000 deaths have been related to air pollution, suggesting a detrimental role of environmental pollutants in the development of CVD. The present study tested our hypothesis that chronic ozone exposure enhances the sensitivity to ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury in isolated perfused hearts. Sprague-Dawley rats were continuously exposed for 8 h/day for 28 and 56 days to filtered air or 0.8 ppm ozone. Isolated hearts were subjected to 30 min of global ischemia followed by 60 min of reperfusion. Cardiac function after I/R measured as left ventricular developed pressure (LVDP), +dP/dt, -dP/dt, and left ventricular end diastolic pressure (LVEDP) was significantly decreased and increased respectively in ozone-exposed I/R hearts compared to I/R hearts exposed to filtered air. The enhanced sensitivity to I/R injury upon ozone exposure was associated with increased myocardial TNF-alpha levels and lipid peroxidation and decreased myocardial activities of superoxidase dismutase (SOD) and IL-10. These data suggest that ozone-induced sensitivity to myocardial I/R injury may be due to promoting levels of oxidative stress as well as inflammatory mediators.",5.3.8,Systemic Inflammation and Oxidative/Nitrosative Stress,4.1.4.3,Animal Toxicological Studies

Identification of the minimal ozone (O-3) concentration and/or dose that induces measurable lung function decrements in humans is considered in the risk assessment leading to establishing an appropriate National Ambient Air Quality Standard for O-3 that protects public health. Objectives: To identify and/or predict the minimal mean O-3 concentration that produces a decrement in FEV1 and symptoms in healthy individuals completing 6.6-hour exposure protocols. Methods: Pulmonary function and subjective symptoms were measured in 31 healthy adults (18-25 yr, male and female, nonsmokers) who completed five 6.6-hour chamber exposures: filtered air and four variable hourly patterns with mean O-3 concentrations of 60, 70, 80, and 87 parts per billion (ppb). Measurements and Main Results: Compared with filtered air, statistically significant decrements in FEV1 and increases in total subjective symptoms scores (P < 0.05) were measured after exposure to mean concentrations of 70, 80, and 87 ppb O-3. The mean percent change in FEV1 (+/- standard error) at the end of each protocol was 0.80 +/- 0.90, -2.72 +/- 1.48, -5.34 +/- 1.42, -7.02 +/- 1.60, and -11.42 +/- 2.20% for exposure to filtered air and 60, 70, 80, and 87 ppb O-3, respectively. Conclusions: Inhalation of 70 ppb O-3 for 6.6 hours, a concentration below the current 8-hour National Ambient Air Quality Standard of 75 ppb, is sufficient to induce statistically significant decrements in FEV1 in healthy young adults.",6.2.1.1,Controlled Human Exposure,3.1.4.1.1,Controlled Human Exposure Studies

This report is EPA?s latest evaluation of the scientific literature on the potential human health and welfare effects associated with ambient exposures to CO. The development of this document is part of the Agency's periodic review of the national ambient air quality standards (NAAQS) for CO. The recently completed CO ISA and supplementary annexes, in conjunction with additional technical and policy assessments developed by EPA?s Office of Air and Radiation, will provide the scientific basis to inform EPA decisions related to the review of the current CO NAAQS.

Carbon monoxide (CO) is one of six principal (or criteria) pollutants for which EPA has established NAAQS. Periodically, EPA reviews the scientific basis for these standards by preparing an Integrated Science Assessment (ISA) (formerly called an Air Quality Criteria Document). The ISA and supplementary annexes, in conjunction with additional technical and policy assessments, provide the scientific basis for EPA decisions on the adequacy of the current NAAQS and the appropriateness of possible alternative standards. The Clean Air Scientific Advisory Committee (CASAC), an independent science advisory committee whose existence and whose review and advisory functions are mandated by Section 109 (d) (2) of the Clean Air Act, is charged (among other things) with independent scientific review of EPA's air quality criteria.

The first and second drafts of the CO ISA were reviewed at public meetings of the CASAC CO Review Panel on May 12-13, 2009 and November 16-17, 2009, respectively. This final CO ISA has benefited from the expert comments received at the CASAC meetings and from public comments, and it has been revised accordingly.",3.6.2.1,Urban-Focused Variability,1.3.1.1.2,U.S. Anthropogenic Carbon Monoxide

Ozone is known to cause an immediate decrease in lung function and increased airway inflammation. However, it is not known whether GSTM1 modulates these ozone responses in vivo in human subjects. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to determine whether the GSTM1 null genotype modulates ozone responses in human subjects. METHODS: Thirty-five healthy volunteers were genotyped for the GSTM1 null mutation and underwent a standard ozone exposure protocol to determine whether lung function and inflammatory responses to ozone were different between the 19 GSTM1 wild type and 16 GSTM1 null volunteers. RESULTS: GSTM1 did not modulate lung function responses to acute ozone. Granulocyte influx 4 hours after challenge was similar between GSTM1 normal and null volunteers. However, GSTM1 null volunteers had significantly increased airway neutrophils 24 hours after challenge, as well as increased expression of HLA-DR on airway macrophages and dendritic cells. CONCLUSION: The GSTM1 null genotype is associated with increased airways inflammation 24 hours after ozone exposure, which is consistent with the lag time observed between increased ambient air ozone exposure and exacerbations of lung disease.",5.3.6,Modification of Innate/Adaptive Immune System Responses,3.1.4.4.1,Controlled Human Exposure Studies

Using the policy-relevant maximum daily 8-h average ozone (MDA8 O3) statistic, the multi-model ensemble represents the observations well (mean r2=0.57, ensemble bias = +4.1 ppbv for all US regions and all seasons) despite a wide range in the individual model results. Correlations are strongest in the northeastern US during spring and fall (r2=0.68); and weakest in the midwestern US in summer (r2=0.46). However, large positive mean biases exist during summer for all eastern US regions, ranging from 10?20 ppbv, and a smaller negative bias is present in the western US during spring (~3 ppbv). In nearly all other regions and seasons, the biases of the model ensemble simulations are ?5 ppbv. Sensitivity simulations in which anthropogenic O3-precursor emissions (NOx + NMVOC + CO + aerosols) were decreased by 20% in four source regions: East Asia (EA), South Asia (SA), Europe (EU) and North America (NA) show that the greatest response of MDA8 O3 to the summed foreign emissions reductions occurs during spring in the West (0.9 ppbv reduction due to 20% emissions reductions from EA + SA + EU). East Asia is the largest contributor to MDA8 O3 at all ranges of the O3 distribution for most regions (typically ~0.45 ppbv) followed closely by Europe. The exception is in the northeastern US where emissions reductions in EU had a slightly greater influence than EA emissions, particularly in the middle of the MDA8 O3 distribution (response of ~0.35 ppbv between 35?55 ppbv). EA and EU influences are both far greater (about 4x) than that from SA in all regions and seasons. In all regions and seasons O3-precursor emissions reductions of 20% in the NA source region decrease MDA8 O3 the most ? by a factor of 2 to nearly 10 relative to foreign emissions reductions. The O3 response to anthropogenic NA emissions is greatest in the eastern US during summer at the high end of the O3 distribution (5?6 ppbv for 20% reductions). While the impact of foreign emissions on surface O3 in the US is not negligible ? and is of increasing concern given the recent growth in Asian emissions ? domestic emissions reductions remain a far more effective means of decreasing MDA8 O3 values, particularly those above 75 ppb (the current US standard).",3.3.1,Global Scale CTMs,1.8.1.1,Zero Out and Other Source Sensitivity Approaches

As a result of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) State Implementation call, power plant NOx emissions over the eastern United States decreased significantly, as reflected by a 23% decrease in summer surface emissions from our 2004 inventory to the 1999 U.S. EPA National Emissions Inventory. We increase the model lightning NOx source over northern midlatitude continents (by a factor of 10) and the fraction emitted into the free troposphere (FT, from 80% to 98%) to better match the recent observation?based estimates. While these NOx source updates improve the simulation of NOx and O3 compared to the Intercontinental Chemical Transport Experiment?North America aircraft observations, a bias in the partitioning between nitric acid (HNO3) and peroxyacetylnitrate (PAN) remains especially above 8 km, suggesting gaps in the current understanding of upper tropospheric processes. We estimate a model NOy export efficiency of 4%?14% to the North Atlantic in the FT, within the range of previous plume?based estimates (3%?20%) and lower than the 30% exported directly from the continental boundary layer. Lightning NOx contributes 24%?43% of the FT NOy export from the U.S. to the North Atlantic and 28%?34% to the NOy wet deposition over the United States, with the ranges reflecting different assumptions. Increasing lightning NOx decreases the fractional contribution of PAN to total NOy export, increases the O3 production in the northern extratropical FT by 33%, and decreases the regional mean ozone production efficiency per unit NOx (OPE) by 30%. If models underestimate the lightning NOx source, they would overestimate the background OPE in the FT and the fractional contribution of PAN to NOy export. Therefore, a model underestimate of lightning NOx would likely lead to an overestimate of the downwind O3 production due to anthropogenic NOx export. Better constraints on the lightning NOx source are required to more confidently assess the impacts of anthropogenic emissions and their changes on air quality over downwind regions.",3.2.1,Sources of Precursors Involved in O3 Formation,1.3.1.3.4,Lightning Nitrogen Oxides (NOX)

Sulphuric acid concentrations were usually below the detectable limit of 2 ?g/m3. The highest hourly concentrations of 5 ?g/m3 were attained on days of relatively low sulphur concentrations. Due to the low concentrations of SO2 and H2SO4, these environmental variables will not be considered further here.

The environmental factors of interest are PM2.5, SO4=, O3 (one-hour maximum), temperature, and relative humidity, where SO4=, temperature, and relative humidity are averages of continuous measurements over the sampling period. The values of these variables are listed by lung-function testing period in Table 1. Two periods of elevated pollution levels occurred during the study period, the first lasting from 30 June P. M. to 1 July P. M., and the second from 3 July P. M. to 4 July P. M. On four of the nine days, the current Ontario air-quality standard for ozone of 80 ppb (1-hour maximum) was attained or exceeded. A back-trajectory analysis conducted by Environment Canada showed air-mass transport from the Ohio valley on both 30 June and 3 July.

Fifty-two campers, including 23 asthmatics (12 boys and 11 girls) and 29 nonasthmatics (16 boys and 13 girls), completed all components of the study. The mean values of the three lung-function indictors (FVC, FEV1.0, and PEF) for asthmatics and nonasthmatics are given in Table 2 for each of 18 testing periods. The first testing period (29 June P. M.) was considered as a training session and is not included in this presentation. The three lung-function responses tend to follow a similar pattern over time, with the highest responses occurring at the beginning of the camp, followed by a steep decline for several subsequent testing periods. A gradual increase is then observed, with some stabilization occurring near the completion of the camp. The child-specific variation in lung function over time is given in Table 3. There are appreciable differences in the variance of the lung-function measurements between children, with asthmatics tending to exhibit larger variances than their nonasthmatic counterparts.

Table 4 gives the frequency of a positive response to several questions concerning respiratory symptoms for each session for asthmatics and nonasthmatics respectively. Here, a positive response to Cough and Sneeze is defined as an occurrence of these symptoms five or more times since the previous lung-function testing session. The number of children using medication since the last session is also reported.

Objectives: To test whether airway effects occur below the current ozone standard and if they are more pronounced in potentially susceptible individuals, such as those deficient in the antioxidant gene glutathione S-transferase M1. 

Methods: Pulmonary function and subjective symptoms were measured in 59 healthy young adults (19-35 years) immediately before and after exposure to 0.0 (clean air, CA) and 0.06 ppm ozone for 6.6 hours in a chamber while undergoing intermittent moderate exercise. The polymorphonuclear neutrophil (PMN) influx was measured in 24 subjects 16-18 hour post-exposure 

Measurements and Main Results: Subjects experienced a significantly greater (p=0.008) change in FEV1 (?standard error) immediately following exposure to 0.06ppm ozone compared to CA (-1.76?0.50% vs. -0.002?0.46%). The decrement in FVC was also greater (p=0.02) after ozone vs. CA (-2.32?0.41% vs. -1.13?0.34%). Similarly, changes in %PMN were greater after ozone (54.0?4.6%) than CA (38.3?3.7%) exposure (p<0.001). Symptom scores were not different between ozone vs. CA. There were no significant differences in changes in FEV1, FVC and %PMN between subjects with GSTM1-positive and GSTM1-null genotypes. 

Conclusions: Exposure of healthy young adults to 0.06 ppm ozone for 6.6 hours causes a significant decrement of FEV1 and increase in neutrophilic inflammation in the airways.

Besides the well-described respiratory tract inflammation and dysfunctions, there is accumulating evidence indicating that O(3) exposure affects brain functions. However, the mechanisms through which O(3) exerts toxic effects on the brain remain poorly understood. This work aimed at precisely characterizing CNS neuronal activation after O(3) inhalation using Fos staining in adult rat. We showed that, together with lung inflammation, O(3) exposure caused a sustained time- and dose-dependent neuronal activation in the dorsolateral regions of the nucleus tractus solitarius overlapping terminal fields of lung afferents running in vagus nerves. Furthermore, we highlighted neuronal activation in interconnected central structures such as the caudal ventrolateral medulla, the parabrachial nucleus, the central nucleus of the amygdala, the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis and the paraventricular hypothalamic nucleus. In contrast, we did not detect any neuronal activation in the thoracic spinal cord where lung afferents running in spinal nerves terminate. Overall, our results demonstrate that O(3) challenge evokes a lung inflammation that induces the activation of nucleus tractus solitarius neurons through the vagus nerves and promotes neuronal activation in stress-responsive regions of the CNS.",5.3.2,Activation of Neural Reflexes,5.1.2,Biological Plausibility

To assess the risks of maternal inhalation exposure to ozone (O(3)), timed pregnant BALB/c mice were exposed to different concentrations of O(3) (0, 0.4, 0.8, and 1.2?ppm) for 4?h/day for 10 days during gestation (GD9-GD18), and pulmonary inflammation and immune responses were assessed in the offspring at 6 weeks-of-age. Maternal O(3) exposure reduced the number of productive dams by 25% at the highest O(3) concentration (1.2?ppm) and decreased the rate of weight gain in the offspring. Delayed-type hypersensitivity responses to bovine serum albumin were suppressed in the female offspring by maternal exposure to the two highest concentrations of O(3), whereas humoral immune responses to sheep red blood cells were not altered in either sex. Maternal exposure to 1.2?ppm O(3) increased lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activity in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) of the offspring but did not affect the number of inflammatory cells or levels of total protein, IFN-?, IL-17, and IL-4 cytokines in BALF, or CD4(+), CD8(+), CD25(+), and TCR?(+)CD1d(+) T-cells in the spleen. Offspring born from air-exposed dams sensitized early in life (postnatal day [PND] 3) to ovalbumin (OVA) antigen and then challenged as adults developed eosinophilia, elevated levels of LDH activity and total protein in BALF, and increased pulmonary responsiveness to methacholine, compared with animals sensitized at PND42. Maternal O(3) exposure in the 1.2?ppm O(3) group decreased BALF eosinophilia and serum OVA-specific IgE in the female offspring sensitized early in life but did not affect development of allergic airway inflammation by offspring sensitized late in life.

This study investigates short-term effects of outdoor nitrogen dioxide, ozone, sulfur dioxide, particulate matter (PM(10)) and black smoke on exacerbations, respiratory symptoms and lung function in 94 patients with COPD in east London. Methods Patients were recruited from an outpatient clinic and were asked to complete daily diary cards (median follow-up 518&emsp14;days) recording exacerbations, symptoms and lung function, and the amount of time spent outdoors. Outdoor air pollution exposure (lag 1&emsp14;day) was obtained from local background monitoring stations. Results Symptoms but not lung function showed associations with raised pollution levels.

Eulerian chemical transport models (CTMs) have difficulty reproducing these layered structures due to numerical plume dissipation. We show that this dissipation is much faster than would be expected from the order of the advection scheme because of interaction between numerical diffusion and the nonuniformity of the atmospheric flow. The nonuniform flow stretches out the plume, enhancing the effect of numerical diffusion. For sufficiently strong stretching, the numerical decay of the plume is independent of the model grid resolution and is set instead by the flow Lyapunov exponent ?. In this regime, conventional numerical methods are not convergent: upon increasing grid resolution, the plume still decays with the same decay rate. The critical plume size below which the numerical scheme does not converge is set by the geometric mean of the grid spacing and the characteristic length scale l = v/? over which the flow varies, where v is the wind speed. Above this critical plume size the numerically induced decay rate of the plume scales like the square root of the grid spacing. Application to an intercontinental pollution plume in a global CTM with realistic atmospheric flow shows that proper simulation of such a plume would require an impractical increase in grid resolution.

It is intended to provide a baseline for risk and exposure assessments used in setting the National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS). We present here three-year statistics (2006?2008) of PRB ozone over the US calculated using the GEOS-Chem global 3-D model of atmospheric composition with 1/2? ? 2/3? horizontal resolution over North America and adjacent oceans (2? ? 2.5? for the rest of the world). We also provide estimates of the US background (no anthropogenic US emissions) and natural background (no anthropogenic emissions worldwide and pre-industrial methane). Our work improves on previous GEOS-Chem PRB estimates through the use of higher model resolution, 3-year statistics, better representation of stratospheric influence, and updated emissions. PRB is particularly high in the intermountain West due to high elevation, arid terrain, and large-scale subsidence. We present for this region a detailed model evaluation showing that the model is successful in reproducing ozone exceedances up to 70 ppbv. However, the model cannot reproduce PRB-relevant exceptional events associated with wildfires or stratospheric intrusions. The mean PRB estimates for spring?summer are 27 ? 8 ppbv at low-altitude sites and 40 ? 7 ppbv at high-altitude sites. Differences between the PRB simulation and the natural simulation indicate a mean enhancement from intercontinental pollution and anthropogenic methane of 9 ppbv at low-altitude sites and 13 ppbv at high-altitude sites. The PRB is higher than average when ozone exceeds 60 ppbv, particularly in the intermountain West. Our PRB estimates are on average 4 ppbv higher than previous GEOS-Chem studies and we attribute this to higher lighting, increasing Asian emissions, and improved model resolution. Whereas previous studies found no occurrences of PRB exceeding 60 ppbv, we find here some occurrences in the intermountain West.

Impacts of measurement error in epidemiologic studies of ambient air pollution are expected to depend on error type. We characterize measurement error due to instrument imprecision and spatial variability as multiplicative (i.e. additive on the log scale) and model it over a range of error types to assess impacts on risk ratio estimates both on a per measurement unit basis and on a per interquartile range (IQR) basis in a time-series study in Atlanta.<br /><br /> Methods: Daily measures of twelve ambient air pollutants were analyzed: NO2, NOx, O3, SO2, CO, PM10 mass, PM2.5 mass, and PM2.5 components sulfate, nitrate, ammonium, elemental carbon and organic carbon. Semivariogram analysis was applied to assess spatial variability. Error due to this spatial variability was added to a reference pollutant time-series on the log scale using Monte Carlo simulations. Each of these time-series was exponentiated and introduced to a Poisson generalized linear model of cardiovascular disease emergency department visits.<br /><br />Results: Measurement error resulted in reduced statistical significance for the risk ratio estimates for all amounts (corresponding to different pollutants) and types of error. When modelled as classical-type error, risk ratios were attenuated, particularly for primary air pollutants, with average attenuation in risk ratios on a per unit of measurement basis ranging from 18% to 92% and on an IQR basis ranging from 18% to 86%. When modelled as Berkson-type error, risk ratios per unit of measurement were biased away from the null hypothesis by 2% to 31%, whereas risk ratios per IQR were attenuated (i.e. biased toward the null) by 5% to 34%. For CO modelled error amount, a range of error types were simulated and effects on risk ratio bias and significance were observed.<br /><br />Conculsions: For multiplicative error, both the amount and type of measurement error impact health effect estimates in air pollution epidemiology. By modelling instrument imprecision and spatial variability as different error types, we estimate direction and magnitude of the effects of error over a range of error types.",4.6.2.1,Spatial Variability,2.2,Exposure Concepts

PRB enters into the calculation of health risk benefits, and as the US ozone standard approaches background levels, PRB is increasingly important in determining the feasibility and cost of compliance. As PRB is a hypothetical construct, modeling is a necessary tool. Since 2006 EPA has relied on global modeling to establish PRB for their regulatory analyses. Recent assessments with higher resolution global models exhibit improved agreement with remote observations and modest upward shifts in PRB estimates. This paper shifts the paradigm to a regional model (CAMx) run at 12 km resolution, for which North American boundary conditions were provided by a low-resolution version of the GEOS-Chem global model. We conducted a comprehensive model inter-comparison, from which we elucidate differences in predictive performance against ozone observations and differences in temporal and spatial background variability over the US. In general, CAMx performed better in replicating observations at remote monitoring sites, and performance remained better at higher concentrations. While spring and summer mean PRB predicted by GEOS-Chem ranged 20-45 ppb, CAMx predicted PRB ranged 25-50 ppb and reached well over 60 ppb in the west due to event-oriented phenomena such as stratospheric intrusion and wildfires. CAMx showed a higher correlation between modeled PRB and total observed ozone, which is significant for health risk assessments. A case study during April 2006 suggests that stratospheric exchange of ozone is underestimated in both models on an event basis. We conclude that wildfires, lightning NO and stratospheric intrusions contribute a significant level of uncertainty in estimating PRB, and that PRB will require careful consideration in the ozone standard setting process.

Estimates of PRB ozone have had an important role historically in the EPA's human health and welfare risk analyses used in establishing National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS). The margin of safety for the protection of public health in the ozone rulemaking process has been established from human health risks calculated based on PRB ozone estimates. Sensitivity analyses conducted by the EPA have illustrated that changing estimates of PRB ozone concentrations have a progressively greater impact on estimates of mortality risk as more stringent standards are considered. As defined by the EPA, PRB ozone is a model construct, but it is informed by measurements at relatively remote monitoring sites (RRMS).

Wildfires are a source of tropospheric O3, and studies show that wildfires are increasing in North America. In this study, we present a critical review of O3 production from wildfires focusing on three key topics: the influence of wildfire emissions on O3 production; the influence of photochemistry on wildfire O3 production; and regulatory issues associated with wildfire O3 production in the United States. Observations of ?O3/?CO range from approximately ?0.1 to 0.9, and are caused by the interplay of numerous factors including fire emissions, efficiency of combustion, chemical and photochemical reactions, aerosol effects on chemistry and radiation, and local and downwind meteorological patterns. Using average ?O3/?CO ratios for major biomes, we estimate global wildfires produce approximately 170 Tg of O3 per year, which is 3.5% of all global tropospheric O3 production. Areas of uncertainty in wildfire O3 production include the net effect of aerosols on chemical and photochemical reactions within a fire plume, the impact of oxygenated volatile organic compounds and nitrous acid on O3 production, and the interplay of variables that lead to extreme ?O3/?CO values. Because wildfire frequencies are likely increasing and have been shown to contribute to elevated O3 at air quality monitoring sites, it is important to better understand the emissions, photochemistry and impacts of these fires.",3.4.1.2,Contributions from Other Natural Sources ,1.3.1.3.3,Landscape Fires

We find that AM3 with full stratosphere-troposphere chemistry nudged to reanalysis winds successfully reproduces observed sharp ozone gradients above California, including the interleaving and mixing of Asian pollution and stratospheric air associated with complex interactions of midlatitude cyclone air streams. Asian pollution descends isentropically behind cold fronts; at similar to 800 hPa a maximum enhancement to ozone occurs over the southwestern U. S., including the densely populated Los Angeles Basin. During strong episodes, Asian emissions can contribute 8-15 ppbv ozone in the model on days when observed daily maximum 8-h average ozone (MDA8 O-3) exceeds 60 ppbv. We find that in the absence of Asian anthropogenic emissions, 20% of MDA8 O-3 exceedances of 60 ppbv in the model would not have occurred in the southwestern USA. For a 75 ppbv threshold, that statistic increases to 53%. Our analysis indicates the potential for Asian emissions to contribute to high-O-3 episodes over the high-elevation western USA, with implications for attaining more stringent ozone standards in this region.

Such studies have previously reported associations between airborne particulate matter pollution and mortality, and support for a causal relationship has come from controlled-exposure studies that describe pathophysiological mechanisms by which particulate matter could induce acute mortality. In contrast, for ozone, almost no controlled-human-exposure studies have tested whether ozone exposure can modulate the cardiovascular system.<br /><br /><strong>METHODS AND RESULTS: </strong>Twenty-three young healthy individuals were exposed in a randomized crossover fashion to clean air and to 0.3-ppm ozone for 2 hours while intermittently exercising. Blood was obtained immediately before exposure, immediately afterward, and the next morning. Continuous Holter monitoring began immediately before exposure and continued for 24 hours. Lung function was performed immediately before and immediately after exposure, and bronchoalveolar lavage was performed 24 hours after exposure. Immediately after ozone exposure, we observed a 98.9% increase in interleukin-8, a 21.4% decrease in plasminogen activator inhibitor-1, a 51.3% decrease in the high-frequency component of heart rate variability, and a 1.2% increase in QT duration. Changes in interleukin-1B and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 were apparent 24 hours after exposure. In agreement with previous studies, we also observed ozone-induced drops in lung function and an increase in pulmonary inflammation.<br /><br /><strong>CONCLUSIONS: </strong>This controlled-human-exposure study shows that ozone can cause an increase in vascular markers of inflammation and changes in markers of fibrinolysis and markers that affect autonomic control of heart rate and repolarization.

Materials and methods: Existing individual E-R data for 23 human controlled ozone exposure studies with a wide range of concentrations, activity levels, and exposure patterns have been obtained. The data were fit to the original model and to a version of the model that contains a threshold below which no response occurs using a statistical program for fitting nonlinear mixed models.

We investigated the relation between newly-diagnosed asthma and team sports in a cohort of children exposed to different concentrations and mixtures of air pollutants. 
Methods  3535 children with no history of asthma were recruited from schools in 12 communities in southern California and were followed up for up to 5 years. 265 children reported a new diagnosis of asthma during follow-up. We assessed risk of asthma in children playing team sports at study entry in six communities with high daytime ozone concentrations, six with lower concentrations, and in communities with high or low concentrations of nitrogen dioxide, particulate matter, and inorganic-acid vapour. 
Findings  In communities with high ozone concentrations, the relative risk of developing asthma in children playing three or more sports was 3A3 (95% CI 1A9-5A8), compared with children playing no sports. Sports had no effect in areas of low ozone concentration (0A8, 0A4-1A6). Time spent outside was associated with a higher incidence of asthma in areas of high ozone (1A4, 1A0-2A1), but not in areas of low ozone. Exposure to pollutants other than ozone did not alter the effect of team sports.

In field studies, O3 treatments were charcoal filtered air (CF), nonfiltered afr (NF), and two NF treatments with O3 added for 12 h d-1 at proportions of 1.25 and 1.50 times the ambient O3 concentration. In greenhouse studies, constant amounts of O3 were added to CF for 6 h d-1 to achieve mean concentrations ranging from S to 100 nL L-1. For the greenhouse O3 X CO2 experiment, CO2 concentrations were ambient and approximately twice-ambient for 24 h d-1. Plants were exposed to O3 and/or CO2 for ~ 7 d before infestation with mites; daily exposures continued for 14 to 28 d to allow reproduction for at least two generations.

Carbon dioxide enrichment increased shoot growth of both clones by ~33%. Statistical analyses indicated significant O3 effects In some experiments and nonsignificant O3 effects in others. A trend toward increased mite populations with increased Os occurred, however, on NC-S in all trials. No consistent trends occurred with NC-R. With peanut, a significant linear increase in mite population occurred with increased O3. Carbon dioxide enrichment increased the rate of population increase on both clover clones, but more so on NC-R. At 22 to 28 d after infestation, the total population in the twice-ambient CO2 treatment was 65% greater than in the ambient treatment for NC-R and 22% greater than in the ambient treatment for NC-S.

Biomass was evaluated following 3, 5, 7 and 13 wk exposure. Biomass following 13 wk exposure also included weekly harvests of mature tomato fruit beginning week 8. Carbon dioxide enrichment significantly enhanced total vegetative plant d. wt at each harvest, as well as cumulative yield of mature fruit, whereas O3 significantly suppressed total vegetative plant d. wt at each harvest and reduced total cumulative fruit yield. The magnitude of these changes varied with the development of tomato from early growth to mature fruit yield. Carbon dioxide enrichment reduced the detrimental effects of O3 on total vegetative plant d. wt of tomato following 3, 5, 7 and 13 wk exposure. Final mature fruit yield was 24% higher under enriched CO, treatments than in ambient CO2. Ozone suppressed final yield by 31 % following exposure to 80 nmol mol-1 O3 when compared with exposure to charcoal-filtered (CF) air. The impacts of both CO2 and O3 on yield were, however, dependent upon the presence or absence of the other gas. In the absence of O3, yields were very similar for the ambient and elevated CO2 treatments, but in the presence of O3, yields under ambient CO2 were greatly suppressed whereas yields under elevated CO2 were similar to those in the absence of O3. Thus, enriched CO2 ameliorated most of the suppressive effect of O3 on yield of mature fruit.",9.2.2," ?????Indoor,?????

Three clones (216 and 271[(O(3) tolerant] and 259 [O(3) sensitive]) have been characterized for O(3) sensitivity by growth and biomass responses, foliar symptoms, gas exchange, chlorophyll content, epicuticular wax characteristics, and antioxidant production. In this study we compared the responses of these same clones exposed to O(3) under field conditions along a natural O(3) gradient and in a Free-Air CO(2) and O(3) Enrichment (FACE) facility. In addition, we examined how elevated CO(2) affected O(3) symptom development. Visible O(3) symptoms were consistently seen (5 out of 6 years) at two of the three sites along the O(3) gradient and where daily one-hour maximum concentrations were in the range of 96 to 125 ppb.  Clonal differences in O(3) sensitivity were consistent with our OTC rankings. Elevated CO(2) (200 ppm over ambient and applied during daylight hours during the growing season) reduced visible foliar symptoms for all three clones from 31 to 96% as determined by symptom development in elevated O(3) versus elevated O(3) + CO(2) treatments. Degradation of the epicuticular wax surface of all three clones was found at the two elevated O(3) gradient sites. This degradation was quantified by a coefficient of occlusion which was a measure of stomatal occlusion by epicuticular waxes.  Statistically significant increases in stomatal occlusion compared to controls were found for all three clones and for all treatments including elevated CO(2), elevated O(3), and elevated CO(2) + O(3). Our results provide additional evidence that current ambient O(3) levels in the Great Lakes region are causing adverse effects on trembling aspen.

Spreading dogbane (Apocynum androsaemifolium L.) is one of many indigenous herbaceous plant species exhibiting foliar injury that are commonly monitored in ecosystem assessment programs. Details about possible effects of ambient ozone on reproductive components of these species are lacking. For 103 days, from 31 May to 10 September, A. androsaemifolium plants were grown in open-top chambers in either carbon-filtered air (CF), non-filtered air (NF) (approximately 1Iambient), or chamberless ambient air plots (AA). Aspects of sexual reproduction were measured to determine whether impairment occurs in polluted air. Additionally, the ozone protectant chemical ethylenediurea (EDU) was applied to foliage to determine its effect on foliar injury. By the end of the experiment visible foliar injury was absent in CF air and nominal in the NF and AA treatments. Plants grown in CF-chamber air produced significantly more flowers and fruits than those grown in either NF-chamber air or AA plots. Flowers produced by plants grown in CF air also survived to mature fruits at a rate 1.7I greater than plants in NF air and 1.5I greater than plants in AA plots. We were unable to conclude whether EDU protected plants from foliar ozone injury due to the general lack of foliar injury in ozone-exposed plants. The results demonstrate that foliar injury is not necessarily required to elicit negative effects on sexual reproduction in A. androsaemifolium. Implications for the population biology of A. androsaemifolium related to adverse effects of chronic ozone exposure on sexual reproduction are discussed.",9.4.3.3,Reproduction,8.2,Visible Foliar Injury and Biomonitoring

There is considerable evidence that exposure to ozone, even at current ambient levels in many industrialized countries, reduces grain and fruit yields and adversely affects yield quality. It is also well established that sensitivity to ozone may differ not only between species, but also between cultivars and populations of individual species, and that the impact of exposure is highly dependent on ozone concentration and the duration and timing of exposure. However, few studies have attempted to distinguish between the direct effects of air pollutants on reproductive development, and indirect effects mediated by injury to the vegetative organs and associated changes in the supply of assimilates and other essential resources to support reproductive growth, or the levels of endogenous growth regulators. This review considers the impact of ozone on the reproductive biology of agricultural and native species, and examines its direct effects on specific reproductive processes. The extent to which compensatory responses redress the adverse effects of exposure is also explored, with particular reference to recent studies of Brassica napus (oilseed rape), Brassica campestris (Wisconsin Fast Plants), Plantago major (greater plantain) and Triticum aestivum (wheat).",9.4.2,Visible Foliar Injury and Biomonitoring,8.2,Visible Foliar Injury and Biomonitoring

Depending on the genotype, total seasonal O3 exposure in the range of 50-92 ppm-h had negative impacts on stem, retained leaf, and root biomass accumulation and on diameter growth. Leaf abscission generally increased with increasing O3 exposure and was the principal cause of the decrease in leaf biomass of the O3-treated plants. Considerable genetic variation in O3 responses occurred, as shown by differences in sensitivities among clones and among seedlings. However, the responses to O3 of rooted cuttings and seedlings were similar when seedling means were compared with clonal means for leaf abscission, diameter growth, retained leaf biomass, and root biomass. Comparison of a single square-wave treatment (52 ppm-h) with 70 and 92 ppm-h episodic exposures suggested that the plant response to the square-wave exposure was similar to the response to the highest episodic exposure even though the 92 ppm-h episodic exposure was almost twice the square-wave exposure.

The results from two independent approaches ((a) statistical and (b) micrometeorological) were analyzed for understanding cause-effect relationships of the foliar injury responses of tobacco cv Bel-W3 to the exposure dynamics of ambient O(3) concentrations. Similarly, other results from two independent approaches were analyzed in: (1) establishing a micrometeorological relationship between hourly ambient O(3) concentrations and their vertical flux from the air into a natural grassland canopy; and (2) establishing a statistical relationship between hourly ambient O(3) concentrations in long-term, chronic exposures and crop yield reductions. Independent of the approach used, atmospheric conditions appeared to be most conducive and the crop response appeared to be best explained statistically by the cumulative frequency of hourly ambient O(3) concentrations between 50 ppb and 90 ppb (100 and 180 microg m(-3)). In general, this concentration range represents intermediate or moderately enhanced hourly O(3) values in a polluted environment. Further, the diurnal occurrence of this concentration range (often approximately between 0900 and 1600 h in a polluted, agricultural environment) coincided with the optimal CO(2) flux from the atmosphere into the crop canopy, thus high uptake. The frequency of occurrence of hourly O(3) concentrations &gt; 90 ppb (180 microg m(-3)) appeared to be of little importance and such concentrations in general appeared to occur during atmospheric conditions which did not facilitate optimal vertical flux into the crop canopy, thus low uptake. Alternatively, when &gt; 90 ppb (180 microg m(-3)) O(3) concentrations occurred during the 0900-1600 h window, their frequency of occurrence was low in comparison to the 50-90 ppb (100-180 microg m(-3)) range. Based on the overall results, we conclude that if the cumulative frequency of hourly ambient O(3) concentrations between 50-62 ppb (100-124 microg m(-3)) occurred during 53% of the growing season and the corresponding cumulative frequency of hourly O(3) concentrations between 50-74 ppb (100-148 microg m(-3)) occurred during 71% of the growing season, then yield reductions in sensitive crops could be expected, if other factors supporting growth, such as adequate soil moisture are not limiting.",9.2.3,Field Chambers,8.1.2.1.2,Field Chambers

Circulating prolactin (PRL) levels were significantly elevated after exposure. Pituitary TSH and PRL content was considerably increased in ozone-exposed rats; however, only TSH was released significantly above control values in vitro. Thyroid weight was also significantly increased after exposure. The results suggest that the depression of the pituitary-thyroid axis may be an adaptive mechanism during ozone exposure by reducing hypothalamic stimulation via thyrotropin releasing hormone (TRH) and at the same time lifting the hypothalamic catecholamine inhibition on PRL release.

Data obtained under such conditions are needed for validation of models being developed to predict the effects of increasing CO2 and changing climate variables on plants, ecosystems, agricultural productivity and water resources. Setup costs for the FACE systems used in these experiments are similar to the costs of field chamber systems. Although annual operating costs are about three times the cost of field chambers, FACE plots are relatively large, leading to an economy of scale, so that per unit of treated plant material, FACE systems are the least expensive approach for well-integrated field experiments.

All these factors have a spatial nature, and consequently an approach to characterization of ozone risk is presented that places ozone exposure-response functions for species as seedlings and model-simulated tree and stand responses in a spatial context using a geographical information systems (GIS). The GIS is used to aggregate factors considered important in a risk characterization, including: (1) estimated ozone exposures over forested regions, (2) measures of ozone effects on species' and stand growth, and (3) spatially distributed environmental, genetic, and exposure influences on species' response to ozone. The GIS-based risk characterization provides an estimation of the extent and magnitude of the potential ozone impact on forests. A preliminary risk characterization demonstrating this approach considered only the eastern United States and only the limited empirical data quantifying the effect of ozone exposures on forest tree species as seedlings. The area-weighted response of the annual seedling biomass loss formed the basis for a sensitivity ranking: sensitive - aspen and black cherry (14%-33% biomass loss over 50% of their distribution); moderately sensitive - tulip popular, loblolly pine, eastern white pine, and sugar maple (5%-13% biomass loss); insensitive - Virginia pine and red maple (0%-1% loss). In the future, the GIS-based risk characterization will include process-based model simulations of the three- to 5-year growth response of individual species as large trees with relevant environmental interactions and model simulated response of mixed stands.

These studies are based on retrospective statistical analyses of data from the U.S. NCLAN (National Crop Loss Assessment Network) and the EOTCP (European Open-Top Chambers Programme). In these investigations, a sigmoidal O-3 concentration weighting function and/or different types of summation techniques have been used. For example, in the U.S., from a regulatory perspective, one of the descriptors of O-3 exposure is SUM06 (sum of all hourly concentrations above 60 ppb). Based on this statistic, it was predicted that a three month growing season SUM06 value of 26.4 ppm cntdot hours of O-3 would protect 50% of the crops from yield losses of gt 10%. In contrast, in the UN-ECE studies, an exposure index or critical level of AOT40 (Accumulated exposure Over Threshold of 40 ppb) was selected as the best predictor of adverse crop response and has been used to predict yield losses in spring wheat, green beans and clover. Most recently we have also statistically analyzed both the NCLAN and the EOTCP data retrospectively. The results showed that the cumulative frequency of occurrence of intermediate or moderate hourly O-3 concentrations is important in crop yield loss response. While our NCLAN data analysis showed that the cumulative frequency of occurrence of hourly O-3 concentrations between 50 and 87 ppb is the best predictor of crop response in the U.S., the corresponding results from EOTCP showed a range of 35 to 60 ppb as being important in Europe. There is a debate at the present time as to whether peak or moderate O-3 concentrations are critical in causing crop yield reductions. The resolution of this issue is related to O-3 concentrations that occur when both the atmosphere and the phytosphere are sufficiently conductive for optimal O-3 flux (exposure potential) and uptake. In this context, summary results from a number of independent studies are reviewed to further underscore the significance of moderate O-3 concentrations. In addition, results on the relevance of moderate or intermediate O-3 concentrations are explained in this paper with the use of an independent hybrid, statistical-mechanistic (micro-meteorological) approach. Here the concept includes the importance of ambient O-3 concentrations as they relate to the atmospheric conductivity and the physiological and functional properties of the plant. Further, we provide the numerical equations for applying this approach in O-3 measurement networks, the results of which, can be coupled with crop specific biology by using descriptors such as the ""growing degree days."" It is concluded that these types of efforts will be very valuable in significantly reducing the current controversy associated with the presently popular single point, statistical cause-effect models and the scaled uncertainties consequently associated with regional scale assessments of ambient O-3-induced crop loss through the application of such models.",9.2.3,Field Chambers,8.1.2.1.2,Field Chambers

Free-air CO2 enrichment (FACE) was used to elevate concentrations of CO2 (average enrichment concentration 535 Al l-1) and O3 (53 nl l-1) in developing forest stands in 1998 and 1999. Soil respiration, soil pCO2, and dissolved organic carbon in soil solution (DOC) were monitored biweekly. Soil respiration was measured with a portable infrared gas analyzer. Soil pCO2 and DOC samples were collected from soil gas wells and tension lysimeters, respectively, at depths of 15, 30, and 125 cm. Fine-root biomass averaged 263 g m-2 in control plots and increased 96% under elevated CO2. The increased root biomass was accompanied by a 39% increase in soil respiration and a 27% increase in soil pCO2. Both soil respiration and pCO2 exhibited a strong seasonal signal, which was positively correlated with soil temperature. DOC concentrations in soil solution averaged ~12 mg l-1 in surface horizons, declined with depth, and were little affected by the treatments. A simplified belowground C budget for the site indicated that native soil organic matter still dominated the system, and that soil respiration was by far the largest flux. Ozone decreased the above responses to elevated CO2, but effects were rarely statistically significant. We conclude that regenerating stands of northern hardwoods have the potential for substantially greater C input to soil due to greater fine-root production under elevated CO2. Greater fine-root biomass will be accompanied by greater soil C efflux as soil respiration, but leaching losses of C will probably be unaffected.",9.4.3.1,Plant Growth and Biomass Allocation,8.3,Plant Growth

We describe a prototype FACE system currently in operation in forest plots in a maturing loblolly pine(Pinus taeda L.) stand in North Carolina, USA. The system uses feedback control technology to control [CO2] in a 26 m diameter forest plot that is over 10 m tall, while monitoring the 3D plot volume to characterize the whole-stand CO2 regime achieved during enrichment. in the second summer season of operation of the FACE system, atmospheric CO2 enrichment was conducted in the forest during all daylight hours for 96.7% of the scheduled running time from 23 May to 14 October with a preset target [CO2] of 550 mu mol mol(-1), approximate to 200 mu mol mol(-1) above ambient [CO2]. The system provided spatial and temporal control of [CO2] similar to that reported for open-top chambers over trees, but without enclosing the vegetation. The daily average daytime [CO2] within the upper forest canopy at the centre of the FACE plot was 552 +/- 9 mu mol mol-l (mean +/- SD). The FACE system maintained I-minute average [CO2] to within +/- 110 mu mol mol(-1) of the target [CO2] for 92% of the operating time. Deviations of [CO2] outside of this range were short-lived (most lasting &lt; 60 s) and rare, with fewer than 4 excursion events of a minute or longer per day. Acceptable spatial control of [CO2] by the system was achieved,,with over 90% of the entire canopy volume within +/- 10% of the target [CO2] over the exposure season. CO2 consumption by the FACE system was much higher than for open-top chambers on an absolute basis, but similar to that of open-top chambers and branch bag chambers on a per unit volume basis. CO2 consumption by the FACE system was strongly related to windspeed, averaging 50 g CO2 m(-3) h(-1) for thestand for an average windspeed of 1.5 m s(-1) during summer. The [CO2] control results show that the free-air approach is a tractable way to study long-term and short-term alterations in trace gases, even within entire tall forest ecosystems.

The symptom response of black cherry was most clearly correlated with ozone exposure. The best-fit regression model describing the relationship between cumulative ozone exposures and foliar injury was quadratic (y= a + bx2 + e); the most significant relationships were foliar injury versus the cumulative ozone concentrations of ?=60 ppb and the cumulative ozone concentrations weighted by a sigmoidal function. These observations suggest that higher ozone exposures are more important to foliar symptom development, but cumulatively all exposures contribute to the effect. In 1992, the progression of symptom development on10 black cherry trees at each site was observed and related to cumulative ozone; there was an exponential increase of foliar injury with cumulative ozone throughout the summer. In 1993, eight subplots of five black cherry saplings were established, and ozone-induced symptom incidence and severity was compared with those on overstory trees at associated trend plots. There was no significant difference in symptom expression between overstory and sapling trees; therefore, Park Service personnel can use the more accessible saplings instead of overstory trees to monitor ozone symptoms in the Park.",9.4.2,Visible Foliar Injury and Biomonitoring,8.2,Visible Foliar Injury and Biomonitoring

Lint and seed yields were significantly reduced by O3 in OW and SO plots, while SS cotton showed no yield reductions, except at 0.111 ?L L?1. Yield reductions were primarily attributable to fewer numbers of bolls. Regression equations for lint yield in relation to seasonal 12-h O3 means and total seasonal irrigation predicted yield losses at ambient O3 concentrations relative to a background O3 level of 0.025 ?L L?1 of 26.2% for OW, 19.8% for SO, and 4.7% for SS cotton. The relative similarity in responses of OW and SO cotton was attributed to adaptation to drought stress by SO plants, which maintained the sensitivity of moderately stressed cotton to O3.

Seedlings of three species of conifers, Table Mountain pine (Pinus pungens), Virginia pine (Pinus virginiana), and eastern hemlock (Tsuga canadensis), were exposed to various levels of ozone in open-top chambers for one to three seasons in Great Smoky Mountains National Park in Tennessee, USA. A combination of episodic profiles (1988) and modified ambient exposure regimes (1989-92) were used. Episodic profiles simulated an average 7-day period from a monitoring station in the Park. Treatments used in 1988 were: charcoal-filtered (CF), 1.0I ambient, 2.0I ambient, and ambient airuno chamber (AA). In 1989 a 1.5I ambient treatment was added, and in 1990, additional chambers were made available, allowing a 0.5I ambient treatment to be added. Height, diameter, and foliar injury were measured most years. Exposures were 3 years for Table Mountain pine (1988-90), 3 years for hemlock (1989-91), and 1 and 2 years for three different sets of Virginia pine (1990, 1990-91, and 1992). There were no significant (p<0.05) effects of ozone on any biomass fraction for any of the species, except for older needles in Table Mountain and Virginia pine, which decreased with ozone exposure.

Therefore, a series of multiple linear regressions were used to identify the most explanatory model based on principal components derived from the following independent variables: Diameter at breast height, total height, height to the live crown, percent slope, and a number of competition indices based on the diameter and distance to competitors. These regressions were then tested for different intercepts and slopes between the sensitive and nonsensitive trees.

Injury from ozone was found more often on biomonitoring sites in the eastern Unites States than in the interior or west-coast areas. Further results from the northeast reveal that in any year, there is a higher percentage of ozone-injured plants with more severe symptoms in areas with relatively high ozone concentrations than in areas with relatively low ozone. In very dry years (e.g., 1999) the percentage of injured plants and injury severity estimates are both sharply reduced even though ambient ozone exposures are high.

It was revealed that ozone is the main cause of foliar injury manifested as chlorotic mottle and premature needle senescence. Various morphological, physiological and biochemical alterations in the affected plants have been reported over a period of about 40 years of multidisciplinary research. Recently, the focus of research has shifted from studying the effects of ozone to multiple pollutant effects. Recent studies have indicated that the combination of ozone and nitrogen may alter biomass allocation in pines towards that of deciduous trees, accelerate litter accumulation, and increase carbon sequestration rates in heavily polluted forests. Further study of the effects of multiple pollutants, and their long-term consequences on the mixed conifer ecosystem, cannot be adequately done using the original San Bernardino Mountains Air Pollution Gradient network. To correct deficiencies in the design, the new site network is being configured for long-term studies on multiple air pollutant concentrations and deposition, physiological and biochemical changes in trees, growth and composition of over-story species, biogeochemical cycling including carbon cycling and sequestration, water quality, and biodiversity of forest ecosystems. Eleven sites have been re-established. A comparison of 1974 stand composition with data from 2000 stand composition indicate that significant changes in species composition have occurred at some sites with less change at other sites. Moist, high-pollution sites have experienced the greatest amount of forest change, while dryer low-pollution sites have experienced the least amount of stand change.

Concentrations are predicted to continue to rise over much of the globe during the next 50 years. Although these low levels of ozone may not induce visible symptoms on most vegetation, they can result in substantial losses of production and reproductive output. Establishing the vulnerability of vegetation to rising background ozone is complicated by marked differences in findings between individual studies. Ozone effects are influenced by exposure dynamics, nutrient and moisture conditions, and the species and cultivars that are investigated. Meta-analytic techniques provide an objective means to quantitatively summarize treatment responses. Soybean has been the subject of many studies of ozone effects. It is both the most widely planted dicotyledonous crop and a model for other C3 annual plants. Meta-analytic techniques were used to quantitatively summarize the response of soybean to an average, chronic ozone exposure of 70 p.p.b., from 53 peer-reviewed studies. At maturity, the average shoot biomass was decreased 34% and seed yield was 24% lower. Even in studies where [O3] was < 60 p.p.b., there was a significant decrease in biomass and seed production. At low [O3], decreased production corresponded to a decrease in leaf photosynthesis, but in higher [O3] the larger loss in production was associated with decreases in both leaf photosynthesis and leaf area. The impact of ozone increased with developmental stage, with little effect on vegetative growth and the greatest effect evident at completion of seed filling. Other stress treatments, including UV-B and drought, did not alter the ozone response.

Canopy development in OTCs supplied with non-filtered air (NF) and in ambient (AA) plots was followed by measuring leaf area index (LAI). The dry matter yield was determined after three growth periods in each of two consecutive seasons. Boundary layer conductance (gbw) and wind speed (u) were measured along a vertical profile, and day-time flux were measured along a vertical profile, and day-time flux of O3 was estimated throughout the experiment on the basis of a mass balance. The vertical profile of u showed values in the range 1-1 2 m s-1 at the top of the canopy, and maximum gbw was 20-25 mm s-1. Average reduction in global radiation in OTCs was 25%, and volumetric soil water content was reduced by about 5%. Daily mean Tair was increased by 1 3 C, mean daily maximum svpd by 0 08 kPa, and the temperature sum (degree days with base temperature of +5 C) by 12%. Fluctuations in the difference in daily mean Tair and svpd during the daytime between OTCs and ambient air were related to canopy structure. Differences were largest after each cut and declined with increasing LAI. A small effect of changes in LAI on Tair and svpd occurred during periods with low soil water content. The flux of O3 in OTCs was largest (>100 Ag m-2 min-1) before and smallest (<20 Ag m-2 min-1) after each cut. Calculated deposition veloties for O3 (vd) in the range 0-3 cm s-1 were generally higher than those measured under most field conditions. Overall, in OTCs the deficit in soil and atmospheric moisture was larger than in the open field, and the increase in daily mean Tair was strongly influenced by the stage of canopy development. Changes in microclimate and incoming radiation affected pasture development. LAI was slightly reduced in OTCs as compared to AA plots. The total accumulated dry matter yield for all six growth periods was only about 7% lower in OTCs, but the contribution of clover to total forage mass declined during the experiment. OTCs had no significant effect on weeds. The results indicate that OTCs reduced the competitiveness of clover, and that the increase in growth of grasses compensates for the loss in clover yield.

A novel free-air fumigation system was designed for multi-year exposures of semi-natural grassland plots to either ambient or elevated ozone concentrations at a Swiss sub-alpine site. The system operates by releasing ozone-enriched air from either one of two 120  sectors, placed in each of the two main wind directions. Ozone-enriched air is rapidly mixed with ambient air behind a small transparent windscreen mounted at canopy height around the 7-m diameter circular plots. Ozone generation and dispensing during daylight hours is PC controlled and depends upon wind speed, wind direction and ambient ozone. In 2001, from April to October fumigation was possible during 85% of the time. The ozone-enrichment factor (EF, [O3]enriched/[O3]control) in ozone plots relative to control plots averaged 1.48 (?0.24 SD), and EF was highest with winds of around 2 m s-1. The seasonal cumulative ozone exposure (AOT40) at canopy level was 5 ppm h in the control and 30 ppm h in the ozone-treated plots, with less than 10% variation between replicates, and 13 ppm h in ambient air at 2 m. Variation in ozone across the plot-diameter was <5% for 24-h mean concentrations, but differed by a maximum of 20% in terms of AOT40. There was no difference in microclimatic conditions between experimental plots and ambient conditions. It is concluded that the system is suitable for long-term ozone experiments at relatively low running costs, but that the variation in ozone distribution across the plots may lead to systematic differences in cumulative exposure over longer periods of time which need to be taken into account when relating exposure to biological effects.",9.2.4,Plume and FACE-Type Systems,8.1.2.1.3,Free Air Carbon Dioxide/Ozone Enrichment (FACE) and Plume Type Systems

Objectives: Generally, studies use Poisson regression, with complicated modeling strategies, to control for season and weather, raising concerns that the results may be sensitive to these modeling protocols. For studies of ozone, weather control is a particular problem because high ozone days are generally quite hot. 
Methods: The case-crossover approach converts this problem into a case-control study, where the control for each person is the same person on a day near in time, when he or she did not die. This method controls for season and individual risk factors by matching. One can also choose the control day to have the same temperature as the event day. 
Measurements: I have applied this approach to a study of over one million deaths in 14 US cities. 
Main Results: I found that, with matching on temperature, a 10 ppb increase in maximum hourly ozone concentrations was associated with a 0.23% (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.01%, 0.44%) increase in the risk of dying. This finding was indistinguishable from the risk when only matching on season and controlling for temperature with regression splines (0.19%; 95% CI 03%, 0.35%). Control for suspended particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter of 10Am or less (PM10) did not change this risk. However, the association was restricted to the warm months (0.37% increase; 95% CI 0.11%, 0.62%), with no effect in the cold months.

METHODS: We gathered 71 time-series studies relating ozone to all-cause mortality, and we selected 48 estimates from 28 studies for the metaregression. Metaregression covariates included the relationship between ozone concentrations and concentrations of other air pollutants, proxies for personal exposure-ambient concentration relationships, and the statistical methods used in the studies. For our metaregression, we applied a hierarchical linear model with known level-1 variances. RESULTS: We estimated a grand mean of a 0.21% increase (95% confidence interval = 0.16-0.26%) in mortality per 10-microg/m increase of 1-hour maximum ozone (0.41% increase per 10 ppb) without controlling for other air pollutants. In the metaregression, air-conditioning prevalence and lag time were the strongest predictors of between-study variability. Air pollution covariates yielded inconsistent findings in regression models, although correlation analyses indicated a potential influence of summertime PM2.5.

In particular, no data are available concerning the behavioral development of mouse offspring after maternal exposure, despite the fact that increasing use is made of this species in behavioral teratology studies for reasons both of economy and in order to increase the effectiveness of subsequent higher-tier studies (e.g., of treatment-genotype interactions). In the present work, female CD-1 mice were exposed during pregnancy (Days 7-17) to different O3 concentrations (0, 0.4, 0.8, or 1.2 ppm); to avoid confounding by postnatal maternal effects, all litters were assigned shortly after birth to foster dams neither treated nor handled during pregnancy. The dams' food and water intake and body weight gain were depressed in a concentration-dependent fashion. Tolerance to these effects developed during continuing exposure; such tolerance was faster in the case of food than water intake. Several measures of reproductive performance, such as proportion of pregnancies carried to term, litter size, sex ratio, frequency of stillbirth, and neonatal mortality, failed to show differences between control and O3 animals. Postnatal body weight gain was slightly but significantly depressed in the 1.2 ppm offspring. Otherwise, the somatic development of O3 pups was indistinguishable from that of controls, save for a delay in eye opening; this effect, however, failed to show a significant concentration dependence. Negative results were obtained in a wide range of assessments concerning (i) the development of various reflexes and responses (""Fox battery"") from birth to Day 18; (ii) ultrasonic emissions on Postnatal Days 3, 7, and 11; and (iii) activity, habituation, response to an unfamiliar object, and hyperactivity produced by a monoaminergic stimulant (d-amphetamine) at 60-61 days. The present data differ from those of a previous study on rats raised by their biological mothers after gestational exposure to O3 (1 and 1.5 ppm), which showed a substantial impairment in somatic and neurobehavioral development (R. Kavlock, E. Meyer, and C. T. Grabowski, 1980, Toxicol. Lett. 5, 3-9). This difference, be it due to species factors, to postnatal maternal effects, or to the time of occurrence of maximal O3 effects (e.g., on food and water intake) after the onset of exposure and before adaptation or tolerance, may provide significant cues for the understanding of O3 effects in pregnant and developing organisms.",7.4.2,Effects on Reproduction,7.1.2.3.2,Toxicological Evidence of Effects on Female Reproduction

Two separate sets of seedlings were each exposed to various concentrations of ozone (charcoal-filtered; 0.5 x (not used in 1989), 1.0 x, 1.5 x, and 2.0 x modified ambient) in two different seasons. Seasonal indices of exposure (SUM00, SUM06 and AOT40) for the 1.0 x treatments were 39.2, 1.9, and 1.62 ppm h respectively, in 1989, and 63.1, 0.9, and 0.78 ppm h, respectively, in 1992. No significant chamber effects were noted, except for reduced height growth in open plots compared with 1.0 x chambers in 1992. In both years, the 2.0 x treatment reduced total, leaf, root, and shoot+root biomass, although some of these changes were only marginally significant in 1992. Stem biomass was significantly reduced in 1989, but not 1992. Leaf area, count and weight were all highly correlated, and showed significant reductions in both years. The leaf area ratio (leaf area/total weight) was reduced in 1989, but not in 1992. Height was not affected by ozone, but diameter was reduced only in 1989. Chamber-to-chamber variation for biomass and leaf variates was greater in 1992, and as a result, significance levels were lower. Weibull functions were fitted to chamber means, and showed significant near-linear declines for most components when log-transformed data were plotted against the SUM06 and AOT40 indices. Individual Weibull models for the 1989 and 1992 data sets, and combined models over both years, were developed. Combined models were adequate for describing ozone responses for all biomass components, as determined by the likelihood ratio test. The data show that the two years of exposure produced similar, but not identical effects, despite large differences in initial size of the seedlings and in seasonal ozone dynamics. Leaf and root biomass were most sensitive to ozone (as determined by the slope of decrease with increasing SUM06), whereas stem biomass was least sensitive. Black cherry seedlings are shown to be among the most sensitive to elevated ozone of the 21 tree species examined to date in Great Smoky Mountains National Park.",9.2.3,Field Chambers,8.2,Visible Foliar Injury and Biomonitoring

In fact, these results suggest that when treated under open-air conditions yield losses may be even greater than the large losses already reported in earlier chamber studies.

At all sites, gas exchange was under tight stomatal control during the growing season. Stomatal conductance was strongly correlated with leaf water potential (R-2 = 0.82), which decreased over the growing season with decreasing soil water content (R-2 = 0.60). Ozone uptake, carbon uptake, and transpirational water loss closely followed the dynamics of stomatal conductance. Peak ozone and CO2 uptake occurred in early summer and declined progressively thereafter. As a result, periods of maximum ozone uptake did not correspond to periods of peak ozone concentration, underscoring the inaropriateness of using current metrics based on concentration (e.g., SUM0, W126 and AOT40) for assessing ozone exposure risk to plants in this climate region. Both J(max) (maximum CO2-saturated photosynthetic rate, limited by electron transport) and V-cmax (maximum rate of Rubisco-limited carboxylation) increased toward the middle of the growing season, then decreased in September. Intrinsic water-use efficiency rose with increasing drought stress, as expected. The ratio of J(max) to V-cmax was similar to literature values of 2.0. Nighttime respiration followed a Q(10) of 2.0, but was significantly higher at the high-ozone site.

METHODS: Long term concurrent trends, temperature, humidity, day of the week, influenza epidemic of 1989, and cyclical covariations with periodicity > 20 days in daily measures of pollution and admissions for 1987-94 were allowed for. 

RESULTS: There were 373556 admissions. No association was found between O3 and circulatory diseases. Four other pollutants were associated with acute myocardial infarction and circulatory diseases combined. P values and attributable cases (95% confidence intervals) for acute myocardial infarction were: black smoke P = 0.003, 2.5% (0.8% to 4.3%); NO2 P = 0.002, 2.7% (0.8% to 4.6%); CO P = 0.001, 2.1% (0.7% to 3.5%); and SO2 P = 0.0006, 1.7% (0.7% to 2.6%).

Acute myocardial infarction was the only diagnosis for which there were significant associations with and without adjustment for cyclical terms. The associations with acute myocardial infarction were significant only in the cool season.

We investigated the associations between fine particulate pollution (PM2.5) and blood pressure during 631 repeated visits for cardiac rehabilitation in 62 Boston residents with cardiovascular disease. METHODS AND RESULTS: Blood pressure, cardiac risk factor, and exercise data were abstracted from records of rehabilitation visits between 1999 and 2001. We applied mixed-effect models, controlling for body mass index, age, gender, number of visits, hour of day, and weather variables. For an increase from the 10th to the 90th percentile in mean PM2.5 level during the 5 days before the visit (10.5 microg/m3), there was a 2.8-mm Hg (95% CI, 0.1 to 5.5) increase in resting systolic, a 2.7-mm Hg (95% CI, 1.2 to 4.3) increase in resting diastolic, and a 2.7-mm Hg (95% CI, 1.0 to 4.5) increase in resting mean arterial blood pressure.

OBJECTIVE: Our cross-sectional study was intended to analyse the associations between long-term exposure to background air pollution and atopic and respiratory outcomes in a large population-based sample of schoolchildren. METHODS: Six thousand six hundred and seventy-two children aged 9-11 years recruited from 108 randomly schools in six French cities underwent a clinical examination including a skin prick test (SPT) to common allergens, exercise-induced bronchial reactivity (EIB) and skin examination for flexural dermatitis. The prevalence of asthma, allergic rhinitis (AR) and atopic dermatitis was assessed by a standardized health questionnaire completed by the parents. Three-year-averaged concentrations of air pollutants (NO2, SO2, PM10 and O3) were calculated at children' schools using measurements of background monitoring stations. RESULTS: After adjusting for confounders, EIB, lifetime asthma and lifetime AR were found to be positively related to an increase in the exposure to SO2, PM10 and O3. The adjusted odds ratios (aOR) per increase of 5 microg/m3 of SO2 was 1.39 (95% confidence interval (CI)=1.15-1.66) for EIB and 1.19 (1.00-1.41) for lifetime asthma. The aOR for lifetime AR per increase of 10 microg/m3 of PM10 was 1.32 (CI=1.04-1.68). Moreover, SPT positivity was associated with O3 (aOR=1.34; CI=1.24-1.46). Associations with past year symptoms were consistent, even if not always statistically significant. Results persisted in long-term resident (current address for at least 8 years) children. However, no consistent positive association was found with NO2. CONCLUSIONS: A moderate increase in long-term exposure to background ambient air pollution was associated with an increased prevalence of respiratory and atopic indicators in children.

Hospital readmissions were recorded in 1992 to 2001. Ambient nitrogen dioxide, carbon monoxide, ozone, and mass of particles <10 microm (PM10) were measured. Particle number concentrations were estimated as a proxy for ultrafine particles. Short-term effects of air pollution on hospital readmissions for myocardial infarction, angina pectoris, and cardiac causes (myocardial infarction, angina pectoris, dysrhythmia, or heart failure) were studied in city-specific Poisson regression analyses with subsequent pooling.

In the presence of differing levels of measurement error across pollutants under consideration, however, they can be biased and as misleading as single-pollutant models. Their appropriate interpretation depends on the relationships among the pollutant measurements and the outcomes in question. In situations where two or more pollutant variables may be acting as surrogates for the etiologic agent(s), multipollutant models can help identify the best surrogate, but the risk estimates may be influenced by inclusion of a second variable that is not itself an independent risk factor for the outcome in question. In this paper, these issues will be illustrated in the context of an ongoing study of emergency visits in Atlanta. Emergency department visits from 41 of 42 hospitals serving the twenty-county Atlanta metropolitan area for the period 1993-2004 (n=10,206,389 visits) were studied in relation to ambient pollutant levels, including speciated particle measurements from an intensive monitoring campaign at a downtown station starting in 1998. Relative to our earlier publications, reporting results through 2000, the period for which the speciated data are now available is now tripled (six years in length). Poisson generalized linear models were used to examine outcome counts in relation to three-day moving average concentrations of pollutants of a priori interest (ozone, nitrogen dioxide, carbon monoxide, sulfur dioxide, oxygenated hydrocarbons, PM10, coarse PM, PM2.5, and the following components of PM2.5: elemental carbon, organic carbon, sulfate, water-soluble transition metals.) In the present analysis, we report results for two outcome groups: a respiratory outcomes group and a cardiovascular outcomes group. For cardiovascular visits, associations were observed with CO, 3 NO2, and PM2.5 elemental carbon and organic carbon. In multipollutant models, CO was the strongest predictor. For respiratory visits, associations were observed with ozone, PM10, CO and NO2 in single-pollutant models. In multipollutant models, PM10 and ozone persisted as predictors, with ozone the stronger predictor.

Pathways by which particles may act involve autonomic nervous system dysfunction or inflammation, which can affect cardiac rate and rhythm. The importance of these pathways may vary by particle component or source. In an eastern US location with significant regional pollution, the authors examined the association of air pollution and odds of cardiac arrhythmia in older adults. 
Methods: Thirty two non-smoking older adults were evaluated on a weekly basis for 24 weeks during the summer and autumn of 2000 with a standardised 30 minute protocol that included continuous electrocardiogram measurements. A central ambient monitoring station provided daily concentrations of fine particles (PM2.5, sulfate, elemental carbon) and gases. Sulfate was used as a marker of regional pollution. The authors used logistic mixed effects regression to examine the odds of having any supraventricular ectopy (SVE) or ventricular ectopy (VE) in association with increases in air pollution for moving average pollutant concentrations up to 10 days before the health assessment. 
Results: Participant specific mean counts of arrhythmia over the protocol varied between 0.1-363 for SVE and 0-350 for VE. The authors observed odds ratios for having SVE over the length of the protocol of 1.42 (95% CI 0.99 to 2.04), 1.70 (95% CI 1.12 to 2.57), and 1.78 (95% CI 0.95 to 3.35) for 10.0 microg/m3, 4.2 microg/m3, and 14.9 ppb increases in five day moving average PM2.5, sulfate, and ozone concentrations respectively. The other pollutants, including elemental carbon, showed no effect on arrhythmia. Participants reporting cardiovascular conditions (for example, previous myocardial infarction or hypertension) were the most susceptible to pollution induced SVE.

Objectives: To investigate whether biological mechanisms linking air pollution to cardiovascular events occurred concurrently in human subjects exposed to urban air pollutants. 

Methods: We recruited a panel of 76 young, healthy students from a university in Taipei. Between April and June of 2004 or 2005, three measurements were made in each participant of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG), plasminogen activator fibrinogen inhibitor-1 (PAI-1), tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA) in plasma, and heart rate variability (HRV). Gaseous air pollutants were measured at one air-monitoring station inside their campus, and particulate air pollutants were measured at one particulate matter supersite monitoring station 1 km from their campus. We used linear mixed-effects models to associate biological endpoints with individual air pollutants averaged over 1- to 3-day periods before measurements were performed. 

Measurements and Main Results: We found that increases in hs-CRP, 8-OHdG, fibrinogen, and PAI-1, and decreases in HRV indices were associated with increases in levels of particles with aerodynamic diameters less than 10 Am and 2.5 Am, sulfate, nitrate, and ozone (O3) in single-pollutant models. The increase in 8-OHdG, fibrinogen, and PAI-1, and the reduction in HRV remained significantly associated with 3-day averaged sulfate and O3 levels in two-pollutant models. There were moderate correlations (r = -0.3) between blood markers of hs-CRP, fibrinogen, PAI-1, and HRV indices. 

Conclusions: Urban air pollution is associated with inflammation, oxidative stress, blood coagulation and autonomic dysfunction simultaneously in healthy young humans, with sulfate and O3 as two major traffic-related pollutants contributing to such effects.",6.3.2.2,Heart Rate/Heart Rate Variability,4.1.11.1,Epidemiologic Panel Studies

The present study aims at estimating the association between particles with diameter < 10 mum (PM SUB 10), nitrogen dioxide (NO SUB 2) and ozone and hospitalizations for cardiovascular diseases in eight French cities during the 1998-2003 period. 

METHODS: The daily number of hospitalizations in each city was extracted from the French hospital information system (PMSI) for cardiovascular diseases, cardiac diseases, ischemic heart diseases and stroke. Excess relative risks (ERRs) of hospitalization associated with a 10 mug/m SUP 3 increase in pollutant levels were estimated in each city by fitting a Poisson regression model, controlling for well-known confounding factors and temporal trends. City-specific results were then combined by inverse variance weighting. 

RESULTS: Daily number of hospitalizations for cardiovascular diseases was associated with PM SUB 10 levels (for a 10 mug/m SUP 3 increase, ERR = 0.8%, 95% CI: [0.2, 1.5]), with NO SUB 2 (1.1%, [0.6, 1.6]) but not with ozone (0.1% [- 0.2%, 0.5%]). Associations were stronger in people aged 65 years and over, and when only hospitalizations for ischemic heart diseases were considered. No association was found between strokes and air pollution levels. 

DISCUSSION: Our study suggests that the ambient levels of air pollutants currently experienced in the eight French cities, which are close to European air quality guidelines, are yet linked to a short term increase of hospitalizations for cardiovascular diseases.

RESULTS: Analysis was hindered by data availability. In the 93 communities with PM10 data, only 25.0% of study days had data on both ozone and PM10. In the 91 communities with PM2.5 data, only 9.2% of days in the study period had data on ozone and PM2.5. Neither PM measure was highly correlated with ozone at any level of ozone or PM. National and community-specific effect estimates of the short-term effects of ozone on mortality were robust to inclusion of PM10 or PM(2.)5 in time-series models. The robustness remains even at low ozone levels (< 10 ppb) using a subset approach.CONCLUSIONS: Results provide evidence that neither PM10 nor PM(2.)5 is a likely confounder of observed ozone and mortality relationships.

Elevated CO2 increased both male and female flower production, while elevated O3 increased female flower production compared to trees in control rings. Interestingly, very little flowering has yet occurred in combined treatment. Elevated CO2 had significant positive effect on birch catkin size, weight, and germination success rate (elevated CO2 increased germination rate of birch by 110% compared to ambient CO2 concentrations, decreased seedling mortality by 73%, increased seed weight by 17%, increased root length by 59%, and root-to-shoot ratio was significantly decreased, all at 3 weeks after germination), while the opposite was true of elevated O3 (elevated O3 decreased the germination rate of birch by 62%, decreased seed weight by 25%, and increased root length by 15%). Under elevated CO2, plant dry mass increased by 9 and 78% at the end of 3 and 14 weeks, respectively. Also, the root and shoot lengths, as well as the biomass of the seedlings, were increased for seeds produced under elevated CO2, while the reverse was true for seedlings from seeds produced under the elevated O3.

Coupled climate-carbon cycle models suggest that global warming will act to limit the land-carbon sink, but these first generation models neglected the impacts of changing atmospheric chemistry. Emissions associated with fossil fuel and biomass burning have acted to approximately double the global mean tropospheric ozone concentration, and further increases are expected over the twenty-first century. Tropospheric ozone is known to damage plants, reducing plant primary productivity and crop yields, yet increasing atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations are thought to stimulate plant primary productivity. Increased carbon dioxide and ozone levels can both lead to stomatal closure, which reduces the uptake of either gas, and in turn limits the damaging effect of ozone and the carbon dioxide fertilization of photosynthesis. Here we estimate the impact of projected changes in ozone levels on the land-carbon sink, using a global land carbon cycle model modified to include the effect of ozone deposition on photosynthesis and to account for interactions between ozone and carbon dioxide through stomatal closure. For a range of sensitivity parameters based on manipulative field experiments, we find a significant suppression of the global land-carbon sink as increases in ozone concentrations affect plant productivity. In consequence, more carbon dioxide accumulates in the atmosphere. We suggest that the resulting indirect radiative forcing by ozone effects on plants could contribute more to global warming than the direct radiative forcing due to tropospheric ozone increases.",9.4.3.4,Ecosystem Productivity and Carbon Sequestration,8.8.3,Terrestrial Carbon Sequestration

However, linkages between growth and ambient ozone concentrations in the field are not well established for forest trees. Ambient ozone concentrations have been shown to cause foliar injury on a number of tree species throughout much of the eastern USA. Symptom expression is influenced by endogenous and exogenous factors and, therefore, ozone-exposure/tree-response relationships have been difficult to confirm. Clearly defined, cause-effect relationships between visible injury and growth losses due to ozone have not been validated. Generalizations of sensitivity of forest trees to ozone are complicated by tree development stage, microclimate, leaf phenology, compensatory processes, within-species variation and other interacting stresses. In general, decreases in above-ground growth at ambient ozone levels in the eastern USA appear to be in the range of 0-10% per year. However, these conclusions are based on a small number of tree species, with the vast majority of studies involving individual tree seedlings in a non-competitive environment. Comparative studies of small and large trees indicate that seedlings are, not suitable surrogates for predicting responses of mature trees to ozone. Process-level modelling is a promising methodology that has been recently utilized to assess ozone effects on a stand to regional scale, indicating that ozone is affecting forest growth in the eastern USA. The extent and magnitude of the response is variable and depends on many edaphic and climatic factors. It is imperative when conducting assessment exercises, however, that forest biologists constantly keep in mind the tremendous variability that exists within natural systems. Scaling of single site/physiological response phenomena from an individual tree to an ecosystem and/or region necessitates further research.",9.4.2.1,Biomonitoring,8.2,Visible Foliar Injury and Biomonitoring

The harvesting hypothesis posits that the deaths associated with an exposure are occurring in people who are dying already, and the effect of exposure is merely to move the death from one day to an earlier day, and has no other effects that would influence deaths.

Objectives: The aim of this study was to analyze the effect of ozone on mortality, and the extent to which this is due to short-term mortality displacement in 48 U.S. cities between 1989 and 2000.

Methods: Time series of mortality and ozone were investigated with a generalized linear model during the June?August months, controlling for season, day of the week, and apparent temperature. We examined an unconstrained and a smooth distributed lag with 21 lags of ozone, and effect modification for city-specific characteristics.

Measurements and Main Results: We found a 0.3% (95% confidence interval, 0.2?0.4) increase in total mortality for a 10-ppb increase in 8-hour ozone at lag 0 during summer months. The effect increased to 0.5% (95% confidence interval, 0.05?0.96) when looking at the unconstrained distributed lag. The shape of the distributed lag indicates that all the effect is in the first week.

Conclusions: We did not find mortality displacement due to ozone; rather, the effect size estimate when looking at 21 days of ozone was larger than when using a single day's ozone concentration. Therefore, these results indicate that risk assessments using the single day of ozone exposure are likely to underestimate, rather than overestimate, the public health impact.",6.2.8,Respiratory Mortality,6.3.1,Short Term Ozone Exposure and Mortality: Data Tables

Plants can limit ozone-induced damages by various defence mechanisms. In this work, changes in the concentrations of antioxidant phenolic compounds induced by slightly elevated levels of ozone were deter-mined in red clover leaves by high-performance liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry. 31 different phenolics were identified and the most abundant isoflavones and flavonoids were biochanin A glycoside malonate (G-M), formononetin-G-M and quercetin-G-M. Elevated ozone (mean 32.4 ppb) increased the total phenolic content of leaves and also had minor effects on the concentrations of individual compounds. Elevated ozone increased the net photosynthesis rate of red clover leaves before visible injuries by 21-23%. This study thus suggests that the concentrations of phenolics in red clover leaves change in response to slightly elevated ozone levels. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

OBJECTIVES: We addressed the question of whether the ozone-mortality relationship is entirely a reflection of the adverse effect of ozone, or whether it is, at least in part, an effect of other secondary pollutants.

METHODS: Separate time-series models were fit to 3-6 years of data between 2000 and 2005 from 18 U.S. communities. The association between nonaccidental mortality was examined with ozone alone and with ozone after adjustment for fine particle mass, sulfate, organic carbon, or nitrate concentrations. The effect estimates from each of these models were pooled using a random-effects meta-analysis to obtain an across-community average.

RESULTS: We found a 0.89% [95% confidence interval (CI), 0.45-1.33%] increase in nonaccidental mortality with a 10-ppb increase in same-day 24-hr summertime ozone across the 18 communities. After adjustment for PM(2.5) (particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter <or= 2.5 microm) mass or nitrate, this estimate decreased slightly; but when adjusted for particle sulfate, the estimate was substantially reduced to 0.58% (95% CI, -0.33 to 1.49%).

CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate that the association between ozone and mortality is confounded by particle sulfate, suggesting that some secondary particle pollutants could be responsible for part of the observed ozone effect.",6.6.2,Associations of Mortality and Short-Term O3 Exposure ,6.3.1,Short Term Ozone Exposure and Mortality: Data Tables

These studies often considered other gaseous co-pollutants also as potential confounders, including nitrogen dioxide (NO2), sulfur dioxide (SO2), and carbon monoxide (CO). However, because each of these air pollutants can have different seasonal patterns and chemical interactions, the estimation and interpretation of each pollutant's individual risk estimates may not be straightforward. Multi-collinearity among the air pollution and weather variables also leaves the possibility of confounding and over- or under-fitting of meteorological variables, thereby potentially influencing the health effect estimates for the various pollutants in differing ways. To investigate these issues, we examined the temporal relationships among air pollution and weather variables in the context of air pollution health effects models. We compiled daily data for PM less than 2.5 mum (PM2.5), ozone, NO2, SO2, CO, temperature, dew point, relative humidity, wind speed, and barometric pressure for New York City for the years 1999-2002. We conducted several sets of analyses to characterize air pollution and weather data interactions, to assess different aspects of these data issues: (1) spatial/temporal variation of PM2.5 and gaseous pollutants measured at multiple monitors; (2) temporal relationships among air pollution and weather variables; and (3) extent and nature of multi-collinearity of air pollution and weather variables in the context of health effects models. The air pollution variables showed a varying extent of intercorrelations with each other and with weather variables, and these correlations also varied across seasons. For example, NO2 exhibited the strongest negative correlation with wind speed among the pollutants considered, while ozone's correlation with PM2.5 changed signs across the seasons (positive in summer and negative in winter). The extent of multi-collinearity problems also varied across pollutants and choice of health effects models commonly used in the literature. These results indicate that the health effects regression need to be run by season for some pollutants to provide the most meaningful results. We also find that model choice and interpretation needs to take into consideration the varying pollutant concurvities with the model co-variables in each pollutant's health effects model specification. Finally, we provide an example for analysis of associations between these air pollutants and asthma emergency department visits in New York City, which evaluate the relationship between the various pollutants' risk estimates and their respective concurvities, and discuss the limitations that these results imply about the interpretability of multi-pollutant health effects models.",6.2.7.1,Summary of Findings from 26 O3 AQCD,3.1.5.2,Emergency Department (ED) Visits

Objectives: To examine the neurobehavioral effects associated with long-term exposure to ambient PM and ozone in adults.
Methods:We conducted a secondary analysis of the Neurobehavioral Evaluation System-2 (NES2) data (including a simple reaction time test [SRTT] measuring motor response speed to a visual stimulus; a symbol-digit substitution test [SDST] for coding ability; and a serial-digit learning test [SDLT] for attention and short-term memory) from 1764 adult participants (aged 37.5 ? 10.9 years) of the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey in 1988?1991. Based on ambient PM10 (PM with aerodynamic diameter <10 ?m) and ozone data from the EPA Aerometric Information Retrieval System database, estimated annual exposure prior to the examination were aggregated at the centroid of each census-block group of geocoded residences, using distance-weighted averages from all monitors in the residing and adjoining counties. Generalized linear models were constructed to examine the associations, adjusting for potential confounders.
Results:In age- and sex-adjusted models, PM10 predicted reduced CNS functions, but the association disappeared after adjustment for sociodemographic factors. There were consistent associations between ozone and reduced performance in NES2. In models adjusting for demographics, socioeconomic status, lifestyle, household and neighborhood characteristics, and cardiovascular risk factors, ozone predicted high scores in SDST and SDLT, but not in SRTT.

The reduced carbon storage would then require further reductions in fossil fuel emissions to meet a given CO2 concentration target, thereby increasing the cost of meeting the target. Simulations with the Terrestrial Ecosystem Model (TEM) for the historical period (1860?1995) show the largest damages occur in the Southeast and Midwestern regions of the United States, eastern Europe, and eastern China. The largest reductions in carbon storage for the period 1950?1995, 41%, occur in eastern Europe. Scenarios for the 21st century developed with the MIT Integrated Global Systems Model (IGSM) lead to even greater negative effects on carbon storage in the future. In some regions, current land carbon sinks become carbon sources, and this change leads to carbon sequestration decreases of up to 0.4 Pg C yr?1 due to damage in some regional ozone hot spots. With a climate policy, failing to consider the effects of ozone damage on carbon sequestration would raise the global costs over the next century of stabilizing atmospheric concentrations of CO2 equivalents at 550 ppm by 6 to 21%. Because stabilization at 550 ppm will reduce emission of other gases that cause ozone, these additional benefits are estimated to be between 5 and 25% of the cost of the climate policy.

(Populus deltoides) grew twice as large in New York, New York, USA, compared to surrounding rural  
environments and that soils, temperature, CO2, nutrient deposition, and microclimatic variables  
could not account for the greater urban plant biomass. Correlations between final season biomass  
and cumulative O-3 exposures, combined with twofold growth reductions in an open-top chamber  
experiment provided strong evidence that higher cumulative O-3 exposures in rural sites reduced  
growth in the country. Here, we assess the field gas exchange, growth and development, and  
allocation responses underlying the observed growth differences and compare them with isolated  
O-3 responses documented in the open-top chamber experiment. Cottonwoods showed no visible foliar  
injury, reduced photosynthesis of recently expanded foliage, early leaf senescence, protective  
reduction in stomatal conductance, or compensatory allocation to shoot relative to root biomass  
for either the chamber or field experiment. Instead, O-3-impacted chamber plants had  
significantly higher conductance and reduced photosynthesis of older foliage that led to reduced  
leaf area production and a twofold biomass reduction in the absence of visible injury. Rural- 
grown field plants showed the same pattern of significantly higher conductance in the absence of  
concomitant increases in photosynthesis that was indicative of a loss of stomatal control.  
Incremental changes in foliar production were also significantly inversely related to  
fluctuations in ambient O-3 exposures. The similarity in biomass, gas exchange, phenological, and  
allocation responses between chamber and field experiments indicate that mechanisms accounting  
for reduced growth at rural sites were consistent with those in the open-top chamber O-3  
experiment. This study shows the limitation of visible symptoms as a sole diagnostic factor for  
documenting detrimental O-3 impacts and points toward a new approach to show O-3 impacts when  
visible injury is not present. Namely, O-3-impacted vegetation showed an unusual inverse  
relationship of increased conductance with lower photosynthesis of older foliage that was  
indicative of a loss of stomatal control. This increased stomatal conductance Of O-3-impacted

Scenarios for the year 2100 included elevated [CO2] and [O-3] (+385 ppm and +20 ppb, respectively), warming (+4 degrees C), and increased winter precipitation (+20% November-March). Simulations were run with and without adjustments for experimentally observed physiological and biomass adjustments. Initial simplistic model runs for single-factor changes in CO2 and temperature predicted substantial increases (+191% or 508 g C m(-2) yr(-1)) or decreases (-206% or -549 g C m(-2) yr(-1)), respectively, in mean annual net ecosystem carbon exchange (NEE(a)approximate to 266 +/- 23 g C m(-2) yr(-1) from 1993 to 2003). Conversely, single-factor changes in precipitation or O-3 had comparatively small effects on NEEa (0% and -35%, respectively). The combined influence of all four environmental changes yielded a 29% reduction in mean annual NEEa. These results suggested that future CO2-induced enhancements of gross photosynthesis would be largely offset by temperature-induced increases in respiration, exacerbation of water deficits, and O-3-induced reductions in photosynthesis. However, when experimentally observed physiological adjustments were included in the simulations (e.g. acclimation of leaf respiration to warming), the combined influence of the year 2100 scenario resulted in a 20% increase in NEEa not a decrease.

Symptoms include visible lesions on the leaf surface, reduced growth and a hypothesized reduction in allocation of carbohydrate to roots. The generality of this latter phenomenon has not been demonstrated. Here, a meta-analysis is performed of all available experimental data, to test the hypotheses that O-3 exposure of the shoot inhibits biomass allocation below ground (the root/shoot allometric coefficient, k) and inhibits whole-plant growth rate [relative growth rate (RGR)]. Both k and RGR were significantly reduced by O-3 (5.6 and 8.2%, respectively). Variability in k was greater than in RGR, and both exhibited some positive as well as mostly negative responses. The effects on k were distinct from the effects on RGR. In some cases, k was reduced while RGR was unaffected. Slow-growing plants (small RGR) exhibited the largest declines in k. These observations may have mechanistic implications regarding O-3 phytotoxicity. There were no effects of type of exposure chamber on sensitivity to O-3. The analyses indicate that the O-3 inhibition of allocation to roots is real and general, but variable.

However, ozone-sensitive bioindicators need to be identified for use in field surveys to detect ozone-induced symptoms. To identify such bioindicators, 28 plant selections were exposed to ozone within greenhouse chambers during 2003 and 2004. Plants most sensitive to ozone included Asclepias incarnata (swamp milkweed), Asclepias syriaca (common milkweed), Cephalanthus occidentalis (buttonbush), Platanus occidentalis (American sycamore), Salix x cotteti (Bankers dwarf willow), Salix lucida (shining willow), Salix nigra (black willow), Salix sericea (silky willow), and Symphoricarpos albus (snowberry).

The incidence and severity of ozone-induced symptoms varied with species, ozone concentration, and length of exposure. Pigmented adaxial leaf surface stipple, bifacial necrosis, and premature defoliation were common foliar symptoms induced by ozone; leaf reddening, bronzing, and chlorosis occurred less frequently. Species that produced classic ozone-induced stipple in this study may serve as useful bioindicators in field surveys to confirm that ozone injury occurs in many parts of the country.

This meta-analysis estimated the magnitude of the impacts of current [O-3] and future [O-3] on the biomass, growth, physiology and biochemistry of trees representative of northern hemisphere forests. Current ambient [O-3] (40 ppb on average) significantly reduced the total biomass of trees by 7% compared with trees grown in charcoal-filtered (CF) controls, which approximate preindustrial [O-3]. Above- and belowground productivity were equally affected by ambient [O-3] in these studies. Elevated [O-3] of 64 ppb reduced total biomass by 11% compared with trees grown at ambient [O-3] while elevated [O-3] of 97 ppb reduced total biomass of trees by 17% compared with CF controls. The root-to-shoot ratio was significantly reduced by elevated [O-3] indicating greater sensitivity of root biomass to [O-3]. At elevated [O-3], trees had significant reductions in leaf area, Rubisco content and chlorophyll content which may underlie significant reductions in photosynthetic capacity. Trees also had lower transpiration rates, and were shorter in height and had reduced diameter when grown at elevated [O-3]. Further, at elevated [O-3], gymnosperms were significantly less sensitive than angiosperms. There were too few observations of the interaction of [O-3] with elevated [CO2] and drought to conclusively project how these climate change factors will alter tree responses to [O-3]. Taken together, these results demonstrate that the carbon-sink strength of northern hemisphere forests is likely reduced by current [O-3] and will be further reduced in future if [O-3] rises. This implies that a key carbon sink currently offsetting a significant portion of global fossil fuel CO2 emissions could be diminished or lost in the future.",9.4.3.1,Plant Growth and Biomass Allocation,8.3,Plant Growth

If current global emission trends continue, surface [031 is projected to rise a further 50% over this century, with larger increases in many locations including Northern Hemisphere forests. This review uses statistical meta-analysis to determine mean effects, and their confidence limits, of both the current and projected elevations Of [031 on light-saturated photosynthetic CO2 uptake (As,) and stomatal conductance (gs) in trees. In total, 348 measurements of As., from 61 studies and 266 measures of gs from 55 studies were reviewed. Results suggested that the elevation Of [031 that has occurred since the industrial revolution is depressing As., and gs by 11% (CI 9-13%) and 13% (CI 11-15%), respectively, where CI is the 95% confidence interval. In contrast to angiosperms, gymnosperms were not significantly affected. Both drought and elevated [CO2] significantly decreased the effect of ambient [O-3]. Younger trees (<4 years) were affected less than older trees. Elevation Of [03] above current levels caused progressively larger losses of As, and gs, including gymnosperms. Results are consistent with the expectation that damage to photosynthesis depends on the cumulative uptake of ozone (03) into the leaf. Thus, factors that lower gs lessen damage. Where both g, and [03] were recorded, an overall decline in A(sat) of 0.21% per mmol m(-2) of estimated cumulative 03 uptake was calculated.

This work was undertaken as the first comparative study of the effects of O3 on the photosynthetic processes and yield of three snap bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) genotypes with known differences in sensitivity to O3 (S156, R123 and R331). Previous information showed R123 and R331 to be tolerant and S156 sensitive. The purpose was to identify physiological subsystems that may mediate those differences in sensitivity. Plants were grown in environmentally controlled field chambers with four levels of O3 (0, 15, 30 and 60 nmol mol?1). Net assimilation (A) and fluorescence were measured throughout the growing season and yield data were collected at physiological maturity. All genotypes were tolerant of low O3 (<30 nmol mol?1) but the highest O3 significantly reduced the yield in all three, with R331 and S156 being equally sensitive on a unit exposure basis. Yield reductions were correlated with A, especially during pod filling. No genotype showed any significant response of stomatal conductance (gs) indicating equal O3 fluxes into the leaves in all genotypes. Mesophyll conductance (gm) was affected in S156 only, where it was reduced by 55% at 60 nmol mol?1 O3. There was an upward trend in F0, and a downward trend in the variable fluorescence ratio (Fv/Fm) with increasing O3 for S156 but not for the other genotypes. S156 was the only genotype to show significant decreases in photochemical quenching (qp) and R123 the only one to show significant decreases in non-photochemical quenching (qn). The sequence of loss of Rubisco content and/or activity and changes in gm, F0, and Fv/Fm could not be resolved in time and may all have been the result of generalized tissue destruction rather than sequential attack on individual subsystems. S156 had the highest photosynthetic rate in clean air but appeared to have no significant capacity to protect Rubisco from attack or to up-regulate Rubisco activity at high O3, thus there was no reserve capacity, while R123 was able to maintain both Rubisco activity and A within narrow ranges. These data suggest that S156 has comparatively little anti-oxidant capacity and/or is deficient in its ability to regulate Rubisco activity. For future studies the best contrasts for resolving questions of physiological sensitivity to O3 would be obtained from R123 and S156.",9.2.3,Field Chambers,8.1.2.1.2,Field Chambers

OBJECTIVES: Our aim was to study the association of the variation in local concentrations of airborne particulate matter (PM) with aerodynamic diameter < 10 mum, carbon monoxide, nitrogen monoxide, nitrogen dioxide, and ozone with platelet aggregation, thrombin generation, fibrinogen, and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels in healthy individuals. 

METHODS: From 40 healthy volunteers, we collected 13 consecutive blood samples within a 1-year period and measured light-transmittance platelet aggregometry, thrombin generation, fibrinogen, and CRP. We performed regression analysis using generalized additive models to study the association between the hemostatic and inflammatory variables, and local environmental concentrations of air pollutants for time lags within 24 hr before blood sampling or 24-96 hr before blood sampling. 

RESULTS: In general, air pollutants were associated with platelet aggregation [average, +8% per interquartile range (IQR), p < 0.01] and thrombin generation (average, +1% per IQR, p < 0.05). Platelet aggregation was not affected by in vitro incubation of plasma with PM. We observed no relationship between any of the air pollutants and fibrinogen or CRP levels.

In the productive San Joaquin Valley (SJV) of California, these species also confront high levels of ozone (O3) air pollution. It is often assumed that C4 species will exhibit tolerance to O3, relative to C3 species, based on limited crop yield-loss data and on responses to a contrasting gaseous air pollutant, sulfur dioxide (SO2). Tolerance to O3 of high-biomass C4 crops such as sugarcane (Saccharum spp.) has not been demonstrated. Here we tested the hypothesis that a clone of sugarcane currently grown on a small commercial scale in the O3?impacted SJV will exhibit tolerance to O3. The hypothesis was disproven. Biomass production declined by over one-third and allocation to roots declined by over two-thirds, over a range of O3 exposures (4, 58, and 114 ppb, 12-h means). These responses are comparable to responses previously reported for O3?sensitive C3 crop species. Greater O3 tolerance may be required to maximize the potential viability of bioethanol production using tall tropical grasses such as sugarcane (for sucrose) or energy canes (for cellulose) in O3?impacted western valleys.

In the vitamin E groups, the testes were comparable to the controls, excluding the 0.5-mg-dose vitamin E group in which perivascular fibrosis and intertubular hyalinization were observed. In the vitamin C groups, intertubular hyalinization, partial arrested spermatogenesis, and desquamation of the seminiferous epithelium appeared proportionall to the vitamin dose. Additionally, premature spermiation was found at a vitamin C dose of 50-mg.

Methods: We applied a case-crossover design in 48 US cities to examine the ozone effect by season, by month and by age groups, particularly focusing on whether there was an adaptation effect.

Results: We found that the same day ozone effect was highest in summer with a 0.5% (95% CI: 0.38, 0.62) increase in total mortality for 10 ppb increase in 8-hr ozone, whilst the effect decrease to null in autumn and winter.

RESULTS: 24-hour average concentrations of CO and NO2 lag 0 days exhibited the most consistent associations with cardiac conditions (2.1% (95% CI, 0.0-4.2%) and 2.6% (95% CI, 0.2-5.0%) increase in visits for myocardial infarction/angina per 0.7 ppm CO and 18.4 ppb NO2 respectively; 3.8% (95% CI, 0.7-6.9%) and 4.7% (95% CI, 1.2-8.4%) increase in visits for heart failure). Ozone (lag 2 days) was most consistently associated with respiratory visits (3.2% (95% CI, 0.3-6.2%), and 3.7% (95% CI, -0.5-7.9%) increases in asthma and COPD visits respectively per 18.4 ppb). Associations tended to be of greater magnitude during the warm season (April - September). In particular, the associations of PM 10 and PM2.5 with asthma visits were respectively nearly three- and over fourfold larger vs. all year analyses (14.4% increase in visits, 95% CI, 0.2-30.7, per 20.6 microg/m3 PM 10 and 7.6% increase in visits, 95% CI, 5.1-10.1, per 8.2 microg/m3 PM2.5). No consistent associations were observed between three hour average pollutant concentrations and same-day three hour averages of ED visits. 

CONCLUSION: In this large multicenter analysis, daily average concentrations of CO and NO2 exhibited the most consistent associations with ED visits for cardiac conditions, while ozone exhibited the most consistent associations with visits for respiratory conditions. PM 10 and PM2.5 were strongly associated with asthma visits during the warm season.",6.2.7.1,Summary of Findings from 26 O3 AQCD,3.1.5.2,Emergency Department (ED) Visits

However, few have examined the possible confounding influence of aeroallergens, or reported findings among very young children. METHODS: A time stratified case-crossover design was used to examine 57,912 ED asthma visits among individuals two years of age and older in the census metropolitan area of Edmonton, Canada between April 1, 1992 and March 31, 2002. Daily air pollution levels for the entire region were estimated from three fixed-site monitoring stations. Similarly, daily levels of aeroallergens were estimated using rotational impaction sampling methods for the period between 1996 and 2002. Odds ratios and their corresponding 95% confidence intervals were estimated using conditional logistic regression with adjustment for temperature, relative humidity and seasonal epidemics of viral related respiratory disease. RESULTS: Positive associations for asthma visits with outdoor air pollution levels were observed between April and September, but were absent during the remainder of the year. Effects were strongest among young children. Namely, an increase in the interquartile range of the 5-day average for NO2 and CO levels between April and September was associated with a 50% and 48% increase, respectively, in the number of ED visits among children 2 - 4 years of age (p < 0.05). Strong associations were also observed with these pollutants among those 75 years of age and older. Ozone and particulate matter were also associated with asthma visits. Air pollution risk estimates were largely unchanged after adjustment for aeroallergen levels. CONCLUSION: Our findings, taken together, suggest that exposure to ambient levels of air pollution is an important determinant of ED visits for asthma, particularly among young children and the elderly.",6.2.7.1,Summary of Findings from 26 O3 AQCD,3.1.5.2,Emergency Department (ED) Visits

We investigated whether obesity and airways hyperresponsiveness (AHR) modify the acute effects of ozone on lung function in the elderly. METHODS: We studied 904 elderly men from the Normative Aging Study whose lung function (FVC, FEV1) was measured approximately every 3 years from 1995 to 2005. We defined obesity as a body mass index of at least 30 kg/m2. Using a standardized methacholine challenge test, we defined AHR as a FEV1 decline of 20% after inhalation of a cumulative dosage of 0 to 8.58 micromol of methacholine. Ambient ozone in the Greater Boston area was measured continuously. We estimated effects using mixed linear models, adjusting for known confounders. RESULTS: An increase in ozone of 15 parts per billion during the previous 48 h was associated with a greater decline in FEV1 in the obese (-2.07%; 95% confidence interval [CI], -3.25 to -0.89%) than in the nonobese (-0.96%; 95% CI, -1.70 to - 0.20%). The same exposure was also associated with a greater decline in FEV1 for those with AHR (-3.07%; 95% CI, -4.75 to -1.36%) compared to those without AHR (-1.32%; 95% CI, -2.06 to -0.57%). A three-way interaction trend test demonstrated a multiplicative effect of those two risk factors (p < 0.001). We found similar associations for FVC. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that both obesity and AHR modify the acute effect of ozone on lung function in the elderly, with evidence of interaction between AHR and obesity that causes a greater than additive effect.",6.2.1.2,Epidemiology,3.1.6.2.1,Lung Function

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has concluded that children with asthma continue to be susceptible to ozone-associated adverse effects on their disease. OBJECTIVES: This study was designed to evaluate time trends in associations between declining warm-season O(3) concentrations and hospitalization for asthma in children. METHODS: We undertook an ecologic study of hospital discharges for asthma during the high O(3) seasons in California's South Coast Air Basin (SoCAB) in children who ranged in age from birth to 19 years from 1983 to 2000. We used standard association and causal statistical analysis methods. Hospital discharge data were obtained from the State of California; air pollution data were obtained from the California Air Resources Board, and demographic data from the 1980, 1990, and 2000 U.S. Census. SoCAB was divided into 195 spatial grids, and quarterly average O(3), sulfurdioxide, particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter < or = 10 microm, nitrogen dioxide, and carbon monoxide were assigned to each unit for 3-month periods along with demographic variables. RESULTS: O(3) was the only pollutant associated with increased hospital admissions over the study period. Inclusion of a variety of demographic and weather variables accounted for all of the non-O(3) temporal changes in hospitalizations. We found a time-independent, constant effect of ambient levels of O(3) and quarterly hospital discharge rates for asthma. We estimate that the average effect of a 10-ppb mean increase in any given mean quarterly 1-hr maximum O(3) over the 18-year median of 87.7 ppb was a 4.6% increase in the same quarterly outcome. CONCLUSIONS: Our data indicate that at current levels of O(3) experienced in Southern California, O(3) contributes to an increased risk of hospitalization for children with asthma.",7.2.2,Asthma Hospital Admissions and ED Visits,3.2.4.5.1,Epidemiologic Studies

The aim was to examine the relationship between air pollution concentrations and total IgE levels in adult asthmatics. METHODS: The present study relates to the 369 asthmatic adults from the French Epidemiological study on Genetics and Environment of Asthma (EGEA), with availability of data on both total serum IgE measurements and air pollution concentrations. Geo-statistical models were performed on 4 x 4 km grids to assess individual outdoor air pollution exposure. Annual outdoor concentrations of ozone (O(3)), nitrogen dioxide (NO(2)), sulphur dioxide (SO(2)), and particulate matter smaller than 10 microm size (PM(10)), and concentrations of summer ozone were assigned to subject's home address. RESULTS: The geometric mean of total IgE was 161 IU/ml and the average of O(3) exposure was 44.9 +/- 9.5 microg/m(3). Ozone concentrations were positively related to total IgE levels and an increase of 10 microg/m(3) of O(3) resulted in an increase of 20.4% (95% CI = 3.0-40.7) in total IgE levels. Adjustment for age, gender, smoking habits and previous life in the countryside did not change the results, and an increase of 19.1% (2.4-38.6) in total IgE was observed with O(3). Negative associations observed between NO(2) and total IgE levels disappeared after including O(3) in the models. Neither SO(2) nor PM(10) were correlated with total IgE levels.

Effects of observed VPD differences (Delta VPD) between OTCs and the ambient air (AA) on stomatal conductance (g(s)) were simulated using 10 model functions from the literature. The dataset originated from 17 OTC crop experiments performed in Belgium, Germany and Sweden. Delta VPD is the resulting difference between the OTC effect on e(s)(T), which is the temperature-dependent saturation pressure of water vapour and the OTC effect on e(a), which is the prevailing partial pressure of water vapour in the air (Delta VPD = Delta e(s)(T) - Delta e(a)). Both Delta e(s)(T) and Delta e(a) were positive during daylight hours. Delta VPD was small in comparison and sensitive to changes in Delta e(s)(T) or Delta e(a). Delta VPD was negative between 07:30 and 10:30 and positive thereafter with a maximum at 20:30 (local time). The positive afternoon Delta VPD was due to an early decrease in Delta e(a), probably caused by ceased transpiration, while the positive Delta e(s)(T) persisted throughout the evening, most likely because of restrained cooling in the OTCs. Both the negative morning Delta VPD and the positive evening Delta VPD were more pronounced during clear, warm and dry weather. Circumstances when VPD had a stronger limiting effect on g(s) inside the OTCs compared to in the ambient air coincided with high ambient ozone concentrations ([O-3]). Calculated wheat O-3 uptake over an [O-3] threshold of 40 nmol mol(-1) was reduced by 8.7% in OTCs, assuming that VPD was the only factor limiting gs and that g(s) was the only resistance for O-3 uptake. VPD is one factor of considerable importance for g(s) and the OTC impact on VPD may contribute to an underestimation of O-3 effects expressed in relation to the external O-3 exposure.

Ambient fine particles (particular matter <2.5 ?m diameter [PM2.5]) and ozone exacerbate respiratory conditions including asthma. There is little documentation determining whether children are more vulnerable to the effects of ambient pollution than adults, or whether pollution causes life-threatening episodes requiring intensive care unit (ICU) admission.

Objective
We investigate the relationship between severe asthma morbidity and PM2.5 and ozone in the warm season, and determine whether there is an age-related susceptibility to pollution.

Methods
Daily time-series analysis of 6008 asthma ICU admissions and 69,375 general (non-ICU) asthma admissions in 4 age groups (<6, 6-18, 19-49, and 50+ years) in 74 New York City hospitals for the months April to August from 1999 to 2006. The regression model adjusted for temporal trends, weather, and day of the week. Risks were estimated for interquartile range increases in the a priori exposure time window of the average of 0-day and 1-day lagged pollutants.

Results
Age was a significant effect modifier for hospitalizations, and children age 6 to 18 years consistently had the highest risk. Among children age 6 to 18 years, there was a 26% (95% CI, 10% to 44%) increased rate of ICU admissions and a 19% increased rate of general hospitalizations (95% CI, 12% to 27%) for each 12-?g/m3 increase in PM2.5.

Interleukin-6 (IL-6) and fibrinogen are biomarkers of systemic inflammation that are independent risk factors for cardio-vascular disease.

OBJECTIVE: We investigated the association between ambient air pollution and systemic inflammation using baseline measurements of IL-6 and fibrinogen from controlled human exposure studies.

METHODS: In this retrospective analysis we used repeated-measures data in 45 nonsmoking subjects. Hourly and daily moving averages were calculated for ozone, nitrogen dioxide, sulfur dioxide, and particulate matter <or= 2.5 microm in aerodynamic diameter (PM2.5). Linear mixed-model regression determined the effects of the pollutants on systemic IL-6 and fibrinogen. Effect modification by season was considered.

RESULTS: We observed a positive association between IL-6 and O3 [0.31 SD per O3 interquartile range (IQR); 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.080.54] and between IL-6 and SO2 (0.25 SD per SO2 IQR; 95% CI, 0.060.43).

Methods: Eligible subjects were SJV residents (CHIS 2001) who reported physician-diagnosed asthma (n=1,502, 14.6%). We considered two outcomes indicative of uncontrolled asthma: (1) daily or weekly asthma symptoms, and (2) asthma-related ED visits or hospitalization in the past year.

Outcomes included sperm concentration, total sperm per ejaculate (count), and morphology, as well as DNA integrity and chromatin maturity. Exposures to O3 and PM2.5 were evaluated for the 90-day period before sampling. We used multivariable linear regression, which included different levels of adjustment (i.e., without and with season and temperature) to assess the relationship between exposure to air pollutants during key periods of sperm development and adverse sperm outcomes.Results: Sperm concentration and count were not associated with exposure to PM2.5, but there was evidence of an association (but not statistically significant) with O3 concentration and decreased sperm concentration and count. Additionally, a significant increase in the percentage of sperm cells with cytoplasmic drop [beta = 2.64; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.215.06] and abnormal head (beta = 0.47; 95% CI, 0.030.92) was associated with PM2.5 concentration in the base model. However, these associations, along with all other sperm outcomes, were not significantly associated with either pollutant after controlling for season and temperature. Overall, although we found both protective and adverse effects, there was generally no consistent pattern of increased abnormal sperm quality with elevated exposure to O3 or PM2.5.Conclusions: Exposures to O3 or PM2.5 at levels below the current National Ambient Air Quality Standards were not associated with statistically significant decrements in sperm outcomes in this cohort of fertile men. However, some results suggested effects on sperm concentration, count, and morphology. Editor's SummaryAdverse effects of air pollution on sperm quality have been reported, but few studies have evaluated ambient exposures consistent with U.S. regulatory guidelines. Hansen et al. (p. 203) studied levels of ozone (O3) and PM2.5 (particulate matter < 2.5 microm in aerodynamic diameter) in association with semen outcomes among 228 presumed-fertile men residing in three southeastern U.S. counties. Exposures were classified based on measurements averaged across fixed monitoring stations in each county during the 90 days before sample collection. Outcomes included sperm concentration, count (per ejaculate) and morphology, and proxy measures of DNA integrity (sperm chromatin structure assay) and chromatin maturity (CMA assay). Associations with exposures during key time windows of sperm development were estimated using multivariable linear regression. The authors report crude inverse associations for O3 and sperm concentration and count, and positive associations for PM2.5 and the proportion of sperm cells with cytoplasmic drop and abnormal heads; however, associations did not persist after adjustment for season and temperature.

The aim of this study was to measure the association between chronic exposure to outdoor air pollutants and adult lung function.

Methods: The relationship between measures of lung function (forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1) and FEV1 as a percentage of forced vital capacity (FVC)) and average exposure to particulate matter ,10 mm in diameter, nitrogen dioxide, sulfur dioxide and ozone was examined in four representative cross-sectional surveys of the English population aged >16 in 1995, 1996, 1997 and 2001. Year-specific estimates were pooled using fixed effects meta-analysis.

Results: Greater exposure to particulate matter ,10 mm in diameter, nitrogen dioxide and sulfur dioxide was associated with lower adult FEV1. The size of the effect on population mean FEV1 was about 3% for particulate matter ,10 mm, and 0.7% for nitrogen dioxide and sulfur dioxide, for a 10 mg/m3 increase in pollutant concentration. The effects were most marked in men, older adults and ex-smokers. FEV1 was not associated with ozone concentration. No associations were found between the pollutants and FEV1 as a percentage of FVC.

A multi-year study was conducted in outdoor sunlit-controlled environment mesocosm containing ponderosa pine seedlings growing in a reconstructed soil-litter system. The study used a 2 x 2 factorial design with two concentrations of CO2 (ambient and elevated), two levels of O-3 (low and high) and three replicates of each treatment. The objective of this study was to assess the effects of chronic exposure to elevated CO2 and O-3, alone and in combination, on daily ET. This study evaluated three hypotheses: (i) because elevated CO2 stimulates stomatal closure, O-3 effects on ET will be less under elevated CO2 than under ambient CO2; (ii) elevated CO2 will ameliorate the long-term effects of O-3 on ET; and (iii) because conductance (g) decreases with decreasing SM, the impacts of elevated CO2 and O-3, alone and in combination, on water loss via g will be greater in early summer when SM is not limiting than to other times of the year. A mixed-model covariance analysis was used to adjust the daily ET for seasonality and the effects of SM and photosynthetically active radiation when testing for the effects of CO2 and O-3 on ET via the vapor pressure deficit gradient. The empirical results indicated that the interactive stresses of elevated CO2 and O-3 resulted in a lesser reduction in ET via reduced canopy conductance than the sum of the individual effects of each gas. CO2-induced reductions in ET were more pronounced when trees were physiologically most active. O-3-induced reductions in ET under ambient CO2 were likely transpirational changes via reduced conductance because needle area and root biomass were not affected by exposures to elevated O-3 in this study.",9.2.3,Field Chambers,8.1.2.1.2,Field Chambers

Objective:We aimed to examine whether variants in these genes
are associated with asthma and whether atopy and exposures to
smoking and air pollution influence the associations.
Methods: Among non-Hispanic and Hispanic white participants
of the Children?s Health Study (n 5 2946), we characterized
variation in each locus (including promoter region) with 6 tag
single nucleotide polymorphisms for ARG1 and 10 for ARG2.
Asthma was defined by parental report of physician-diagnosed
asthma at study entry.
Results: Both ARG1 and ARG2 genetic loci were significantly
associated with asthma (global locus level P 5 .02 and .04,
respectively). Compared with the most common haplotype
within each locus, 1 ARG1 haplotype was associated with
reduced risk (odds ratio [OR] per haplotype copy, 0.55; 95% CI,

Pollutant levels correlated significantly with one another, with higher levels of primary particles,
SO2 and NO2 being associated with lower ozone levels. Regression models showed that
estimated higher exposure to ozone was associated with worse gas transfer and more severe
emphysema. Regression parameters suggested that significance from other pollutants was due to
collinearity with ozone. The 2006 pollutant levels showed linear relationships with cumulative
years, thus validating the model.

We hypothesized that declining air quality during in vitro fertilization (IVF) would adversely affect live birth rates. 

METHODS: Data from US Environmental Protection Agency air quality monitors and an established national-scale, log-normal kriging method were used to spatially estimate daily mean concentrations of criteria pollutants at addresses of 7403 females undergoing their first IVF cycle and at the their IVF labs from 2000 to 2007 in the Northeastern USA. These data were related to pregnancy outcomes. 

RESULTS: Increases in nitrogen dioxide (NO2) concentration both at the patient's address and at the IVF lab were significantly associated with a lower chance of pregnancy and live birth during all phases of an IVF cycle from medication start to pregnancy test [most significantly after embryo transfer, odds ratio (OR) 0.76, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.66?0.86, per 0.01 ppm increase]. Increasing ozone (O3) concentration at the patient's address was significantly associated with an increased chance of live birth during ovulation induction (OR 1.26, 95% CI 1.10?1.44, per 0.02 ppm increase), but with decreased odds of live birth when exposed from embryo transfer to live birth (OR 0.62, 95% CI 0.48?0.81, per 0.02 ppm increase). After modeling for interactions of NO2 and O3 at the IVF lab, NO2 remained negatively and significantly associated with live birth (OR 0.86, 95% CI 0.78?0.96), whereas O3 was non-significant. Fine particulate matter (PM2.5) at the IVF lab during embryo culture was associated with decreased conception rates (OR 0.90, 95% CI 0.82?0.99, per 8 ?g/m3 increase), but not with live birth rates. No associations were noted with sulfur dioxide or larger particulate matter (PM10). 

CONCLUSIONS: The effects of declining air quality on reproductive outcomes after IVF are variable, cycle-dependent and complex, though increased NO2 is consistently associated with lower live birth rates.

To advance understanding of these relationships, further characterization of the dose-response and pollutant lag effects are needed, as are investigations of pollutant species beyond the commonly measured criteria pollutants. Objectives: Investigate short-term associations between ambient air pollutant concentrations and emergency department visits for pediatric asthma. Methods: Daily counts of emergency department visits for asthma or wheeze among children age 5 to 17 were collected from 41 Metropolitan Atlanta hospitals during 1993-2004 (n = 91,386 visits). Ambient concentrations of gaseous pollutants and speciated particulate matter were available from stationary monitors during this time period. Rate ratios for the warm season (May-October) and cold season (November-April) were estimated using Poisson generalized linear models in the framework of a case-crossover analysis. Measurements and Main Results: Both ozone and primary pollutants from traffic sources were associated with emergency department visits for asthma or wheeze; evidence for independent effects of ozone and primary pollutants from traffic sources were observed in multipollutant models. These associations tended to be of the highest magnitude for concentrations on the day of the emergency department visit and were present at relatively low ambient concentrations. Conclusions: Even at relatively low ambient concentrations, ozone and primary pollutants from traffic sources independently contributed to the burden of emergency department visits for pediatric asthma.",6.2.7.1,Summary of Findings from 26 O3 AQCD,3.1.1.2,The Role of Season and Temperature on Ozone Associations with Respiratory Health Effects

However, only a few studies have focused on subgroups of the population especially vulnerable to these effects. OBJECTIVES: To estimate the association between exposure to ozone and cause-specific mortality, and to evaluate whether individual socio-demographic characteristics as well as chronic conditions confer greater susceptibility to the adverse effects of ozone. METHODS: A case-crossover analysis was conducted in 10 Italian cities. Data on mortality were collected for the period 2001-2005 (April to September), for 127,860 deceased subjects. Information was retrieved on cause of death, socio-demographic characteristics, chronic conditions from previous hospital admissions, and location of death. Daily ozone concentrations were collected from background fixed monitors. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: We estimated a 1.5% (95% confidence interval, 0.9-2.1) increase in total mortality for a 10 mug/m(3) increase in ozone (8-hour, lag 0-5). The effect lasted several days for total, cardiac and respiratory mortality (lag 0-5) and it was delayed for cerebrovascular deaths (lag 3-5). In the subgroup analysis, the effect was more pronounced in elderly people over 85 years of age (3.5%, 95% confidence interval 2.4-4.6) than in 35-64 year-old subjects (0.8%, 95% confidence interval -0.8-2.5), in women (2.2%, 95% confidence interval 1.4-3.1) than in men (0.8%, 95% confidence interval -0.1-1.8), and for out-of-hospital deaths (2.1%, 95% confidence interval 1.0-3.2), especially among diabetics (5.5%, 95% confidence interval 1.4-9.8).

Methods: Daily levels of O3 were measured at a background measurement station in 1998-2004 in Helsinki, Finland. All analyses were a priori restricted to the warm season.

We also analyzed data on associations between O3 and asthma emergency room visits among children (<15 years). We adjusted all models for PM2.5, and used Poisson regression for the analyses. 
Results: We found a positive association between O3 and asthma-COPD admissions among the elderly (9.6%; 95% CI, 2.0 ? 17.8, at 0-day lag for 25?g/m3 increase in O3). We found also consistent associations between O3 and asthma emergency room visits among children (e.g. 12.6%; 0.8 - 25.1, 0-day lag).

Seventy-eight patients with mild/moderate asthma had their inhaled steroid therapy withdrawn until LOC occurred or for a maximum of 6 wk. Sixty (77.9%) developed LOC. There were highly significant correlations between the changes in eNO and symptoms (p < 0.0001), FEV(1) (p < 0.002), sputum eosinophils (p < 0.0002), and saline PD(15) (p < 0.0002), and there were significant differences between LOC and no LOC groups. Both single measurements and changes of eNO (10 ppb, 15 ppb, or an increase of > 60% over baseline) had positive predictive values that ranged from 80 to 90% for predicting and diagnosing LOC.

Elevated levels of exhaled levels of exhaled NO in asthma and other inflammatory lung diseases lead to many studies examining NO as potential markers of airway inflammation, enabling repeated noninvasive and standardized monitoring of airway inflammation. In airway inflammation, NO is not merely a marker but may have anti-inflammatory and pro-inflammatory effects. Significant correlation has been found between exhaled NO and skin test scores in steroid naive asthmatic patients, allowing to discriminate patients with and without airway responsiveness. Exhaled NO is significantly elevated in acute asthma, or steroid-resistant severe asthma, or when the maintenance dose of inhaled steroids is reduced, and quickly reduced down to the levels in patients with stable asthma after steroid treatment. Exhaled NO has been successfully used to monitor anti-inflammatory treatment with inhaled corticosteroids in asthma. Exhaled NO is extremely sensitive and rapid marker of the dose-dependent effect of steroid treatment, or asthma deterioration, which is increased to any changes in lung function, provocative concentration causing a 20% fall in forced expiratory volume, sputum eosinophilia or asthma symptoms. Exhaled NO is not increased in stable chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), but patients with unstable COPD, or bronchiectasis have high NO levels. Exhaled and nasal NO are diagnostically low in cystic fibrosis and primary pulmonary dyskinesia.

However the evidence regarding the association between air pollution and acute cardiac events, such as out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, is inconsistent.

Methods: We investigated the association between particulate matter (PM) air pollution and out-of-hospital cardiac arrest using a case-crossover study of adults (age, 35+ years) in Melbourne, Australia. We included 8434 cases identified through the Victorian Cardiac Arrest Registry from 2003 through 2006. We excluded arrests with an obvious preceding noncardiac event such as trauma, poisoning, or drowning, leaving only those events that were presumed to have cardiac etiology. Air pollution concentrations obtained from a central monitoring site were used for day of the arrest and for lag 1, lag 2, and lag 3, including the average lag 0-1. 

Results: An interquartile range increase of 4.26 mu g/m(3) in PM(2.5) over 2 days (lag 0-1) was associated with an increase in risk for an out-of-hospital cardiac arrest of 3.6% (95% confidence interval = 1.3% to 6.0%).

With CB exposure, young B6 and older 129 mice show significant (P<0.01) reductions in fractional shortening (FS) compared to FA. With O3 exposure, FS was significantly (P<0.01) diminished in young 129, which was attributable to significant increases in end-systolic left ventricular diameter. With O3 and CB combined, notable (P<0.01) declines in heart rate and end-systolic posterior wall thickness occurred in young 129 mice. The IVH measurements showed striking (P<0.05) compromises in cardiac function after CB and O3 exposure; however, strain differences were undetectable. These results suggest that PM and O3 exposures, alone and combined, lead to different cardiac functional changes, and these unique changes are age-specific and dependent on Nppa and Npr1 genes.",6.3.3,Toxicology,4.1.4.3,Animal Toxicological Studies

A delay in stomatal responses (i.e., `sluggish? responses) to variable light was found to be both an effect of O3 exposure and a reason for increased O3  sensitivity in snap bean cultivars, as it implied higher O3  uptake during times of disequilibrium. Sluggishness increased the time to open (thus limiting CO2 uptake) and close stomata (thus increasing transpirational water loss) after abrupt changes in light level.

We examined effects of prenatal ambient pollution exposure on average birth weight and risk of low birth weight in full-term births.
Methods: We estimated average ambient air pollutant concentrations throughout pregnancy in the neighborhoods of women who delivered term singleton live births between 1996 and 2006 in California. We adjusted effect estimates of air pollutants on birth weight for infant characteristics, maternal characteristics, neighborhood socioeconomic factors, and year and season of birth.
Results: 3,545,177 singleton births had monitoring for at least one air pollutant within a 10 km radius of the tract or ZIP Code of the mother's residence. In multivariate models, pollutants were associated with decreased birth weight; -5.4 grams (95% confidence interval -6.8 g, -4.1 g) per ppm carbon monoxide, -9.0 g (-9.6 g, -8.4 g) per pphm nitrogen dioxide, -5.7 g (-6.6 g, -4.9 g) per pphm ozone, -7.7 g (-7.9 g, -6.6 g) per 10 ?g/m3 particulate matter under 10 ?m, -12.8 g (-14.3 g, -11.3 g) per 10 ?g/m3 particulate matter under 2.5 ?m, and -9.3 g (-10.7 g, -7.9 g) per 10 ?g/m3 of coarse particulate matter. With the exception of carbon monoxide, estimates were largely unchanged after controlling for co-pollutants. Effect estimates for the third trimester largely reflect the results seen from full pregnancy exposure estimates; greater variation in results is seen in effect estimates specific to the first and second trimesters.
Conclusions: This study indicates that maternal exposure to ambient air pollution results in modestly lower infant birth weight. A small decline in birth weight is unlikely to have clinical relevance for individual infants, and there is debate about whether a small shift in the population distribution of birth weight has broader health implications. However, the ubiquity of air pollution exposures, the responsiveness of pollutant levels to regulation, and the fact that the highest pollution levels in California are lower than those regularly experienced in other countries suggest that precautionary efforts to reduce pollutants may be beneficial for infant health from a population perspective.",7.4.3,Birth Weight,7.1.3.1,Biological Plausibility

Methods: We conducted secondary analyses of data on blood pressure and blood biochemistry markers from the Social Environment and Biomarkers of Aging Study in Taiwan and air pollution data from the Taiwan Environmental Protection Administration in 2000. Associations of 1-year averaged criteria air pollutants (particulate matter with aerodynamic diameters <10??m (PM(10)) and <2.5??m (PM(2.5)), ozone (O(3)), nitrogen dioxide (NO(2)), sulfur dioxide and carbon monoxide) with systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, total cholesterol, triglycerides, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, fasting glucose, haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), interleukin 6 (IL-6) and neutrophils were explored by applying generalised additive models. 

Results: After controlling for potential confounders, we observed that increased 1-year averaged particulate air pollutants (PM(10) and PM(2.5)) and NO(2) were associated with elevated blood pressure, total cholesterol, fasting glucose, HbA1c, IL-6 and neutrophils. Associations of increased 1-year averaged O(3) with elevated blood pressure, total cholesterol, fasting glucose, HbA1c and neutrophils were also observed. In particular, our two-pollutant models showed that PM(2.5) was more significantly associated with end-point variables than two gaseous pollutants, O(3) and NO(2).

We previously found that markers of primary (combustion-related) organic aerosols and gases were positively associated with circulating biomarkers of inflammation and ambulatory blood pressure in the present cohort panel study of elderly subjects with coronary artery disease.

Objectives: We specifically aimed to evaluate whether exposure markers of primary organic aerosols and ultrafine particles were more strongly associated with ST-segment depression of ? 1 mm than were secondary organic aerosols or PM2.5 (particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter ? 2.5 ?m) mass.

Methods: We evaluated relations of air pollutants to ambulatory electrocardiographic evidence of cardiac ischemia over 10 days in 38 subjects without ST depression on baseline electrocardiographs. Exposures were measured outdoors in retirement communities in the Los Angeles basin, including daily size-fractionated particle mass and hourly markers of primary and secondary organic aerosols and gases. Generalized estimating equations were used to estimate odds of hourly ST-segment depression (? 1 mm) from hourly air pollution exposures and to estimate relative rates of daily counts of ST-segment depression from daily average exposures, controlling for potential confounders.

Results: We found significant positive associations of hourly ST-segment depression with markers ?of combustion-related aerosols and gases averaged 1-hr through 3-4 days, but not secondary (photochemically aged) organic aerosols or ozone.

OBJECTIVES: To determine whether sequence variation in genes in the glutathione synthesis pathway alters susceptibility to air pollution effects on lung function. METHODS: In this prospective study, 14,821 lung function measurements were taken on 2,106 children from 12 Southern California cities. Tagging single-nucleotide polymorphisms in glutathione metabolism pathway genes GSS, GSR, GCLM, and GCLC were genotyped by GoldenGate assay (Illumina, San Diego, CA). Mixed regression models were used to determine whether particular haplotypes were associated with FEV(1), maximal mid-expiratory flow rate, and FVC and whether any of the genetic associations varied with levels of exposure to air pollutants.

Methods: Daily levels of urban O3 pollution, the incidence of first-ever, recurrent, fatal and non-fatal ischaemic cerebrovascular events (ICVE) and myocardial infarction (MI) were correlated using a case-crossover design. The authors analysed 1574 ICVE and 913 MI that occurred in Dijon, France (150?000 inhabitants) from 2001 to 2007. Sulfur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), carbon monoxide (CO) and particulate matter with an aerodiameter of ?10??g/m3 (PM10) were used to create bi-pollutant models. Using the adjusted OR, the effects of O3 exposure were calculated for every 10??g/m3 increase in pollutants in multivariate logistic models adjusted for temperature, humidity, flu outbreaks and holidays.

Results: The authors found a significant association between exposure to O3 and recurrent ICVE with a 3-day lag (OR=1.115; 95% CI 1.027 to 1.209). The direction and magnitude of the association between exposure to O3 and recurrent MI were similar but not statistically significant. For incident events, the authors detected only a non-significant association for ICVE with a 2-day lag (OR=1.041; 95% CI 0.996 to 1.089). In the subgroup analysis for ICVE, the authors observed an increased association with cardiovascular risk factors (OR=1.523; 95% CI 1.149 to 2.018).

The specific factors underlying this differential susceptibility are unknown but may be related to air pollutant-induced nasal alterations during postnatal development that impair the normal physiological functions (e.g., filtration and mucociliary clearance) serving to protect the more distal airways from inhaled xenobiotics. In adult animal models, chronic ozone exposure is associated with adaptations leading to a decrease in airway injury. The purpose of our study was to determine whether cyclic ozone exposure induces persistent morphological and biochemical effects on the developing nasal airways of infant monkeys early in life. Infant (180-day-old) rhesus macaques were exposed to 5 consecutive days of O(3) [0.5 parts per million (ppm), 8 h/day; &quot;1-cycle&quot;] or filtered air (FA) or 11 biweekly cycles of O(3) (FA days 1-9; 0.5 ppm, 8 h/day on days 10-14; &quot;11-cycle&quot;). The left nasal passage was processed for light microscopy and morphometric analysis. Mucosal samples from the right nasal passage were processed for GSH, GSSG, ascorbate (AH(2)), and uric acid (UA) concentration. Eleven-cycle O(3) induced persistent rhinitis, squamous metaplasia, and epithelial hyperplasia in the anterior nasal airways of infant monkeys, resulting in a 39% increase in the numeric density of epithelial cells. Eleven-cycle O(3) also induced a 65% increase in GSH concentrations at this site. The persistence of epithelial hyperplasia was positively correlated with changes in GSH.

OBJECTIVE: We investigated whether ozone was associated with survival in four cohorts of persons with specific diseases in 105 US cities, treating ozone as a time varying exposure. METHODS: We used Medicare data (1985-2006), and constructed cohorts of persons hospitalized with chronic conditions that might predispose to ozone effects: chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), diabetes, congestive heart failure (CHF), and myocardial infarction (MI). Yearly warm-season average ozone was merged to the individual follow up in each city. We applied Cox's proportional hazard model for each cohort within each city, adjusting for individual risk factors, temperature and city specific long term trends.

Fine-mode and coarse-mode particles differ in sources, composition, and properties. The overlap of fine-mode and coarse-mode particles in PM2.5 may cause difficulty in interpretation of the data. The hypothesis is advanced that the intrusion of coarse-mode material into the fine mode will cause more problems than the intrusion of fine-mode material into the course mode.

Clinical studies in which humans were repeatedly exposed to ozone have revealed that lung function decrement decreases after each additional exposure event. Ozone concentrations in the ambient atmosphere show strong seasonal, episodic, and diurnal fluctuations. Accordingly, in quantitative risk analysis a model is needed, which accounts for the time dependence of the lung function decrement on observed exposure patterns. This paper presents a toxico-dynamic model predicting lung function and cellular injury and repair over time. Any ozone exposure pattern can be used as an input to the model, to predict the development of lung function decrement in time. The model incorporates the biological mechanisms generally believed to play a role in the lung function decrement due to ozone exposure. A comparison was made of the model's predictions and observed lung function decrements in seven different clinical studies.

Analysis of chamber results showed that the proportion of hosts parasitised and the searching efficiency of the parasitoids were both significantly reduced with O3 fumigation, but not with NO2 or SO2 fumigations. O3 fumigation reduced percentage parasitism by approximately 10%. Parasitoids were able to avoid patches with no hosts, both in filtered air controls and when exposed to pollutants. However in the O3 and NO2 treatments they appeared less able to discriminate between different host densities, suggesting that pollutants may interfere with the olfactory responses of the parasitoids. These results indicate the potential for air pollutants, particularly O3, to negatively influence the searching behaviour of parasitoids, and hence reduce the efficiency of natural enemy control of many pest species.",9.4.9.3,Indirect Effects on Wildlife,8.7.3,Plant Attraction of Natural Enemies of Herbivores

Under dry canopy conditions gc < gsurf indicating a significant residual conductance of a non-stomatal pathway for ozone deposition (gr), possibly reflecting reaction of O3 with nitric oxide emitted from fertilized soil. Dewfall reduced ozone deposition and eliminated gr. However, gr may actually have been increased by dew in amphistomatous cotton, as it was in hypostomatous grape during CODE. If so, canopy wetness reduced the stomatal pathway (gc) by occlusion of adaxial pores sufficiently to offset both the nitric oxide titration and the true wetness enhancement of gr. We conclude that ozone deposition to cotton is largely controlled by stomatal responses. Stomatal responses may readily be modelled, potentially providing sufficient information to infer ozone deposition. In contrast to the case for hypostomatous grape, ozone uptake (particularly by the stomatal pathway) is reduced by leaf surface wetness in amphistomatous cotton. Alternative models of single leaf stomatal conductance and expected errors of ? 20% in model parameters did not affect these conclusions.",9.5.4,Ozone Uptake/Dose Modeling for Vegetation,8.13.1,Exposure Indices

Thus, tobacco plants, Nicotiana tabacum L, were exposed to 4 concentrations of O3 in open-top chambers at the U. S. Department of Agriculture, Agricultural Research Service, Air Quality Research Unit at Raleigh, NC. The O3 treatments were charcoal-filtered air (CF), nonfiltered air (NF), and NF with O3 added for 12 h/d (0900-2100 hours EST) to obtain proportions of O3 ~ 1.4 times ambient (NF1) and 1.7 times ambient (NF2). After plants had been exposed to ozone for at least 5 d, eggs from tobacco hornworm moths, Manduca sexta (L.), were counted and removed daily from the plants. Hornworm moths oviposited significantly more eggs on plants grown in the highest O3 treatment (NF2). However, when plants were removed from the chambers, or when the O3 was turned off in the chambers, there were no differences in ovipositional preferences of Al. sexta females. Tobacco plants in treatments with enhanced O3 had lower levels of total cuticular cembranoid diterpenes, which are important ovipositional stimulants for Al. sexta. Therefore, observed changes in leaf-surface chemistry (i.e., lowered cembranoid diterpenes) do not explain the higher oviposition rates by M. sexta moths on plants grown in chambers with enhanced O3.",9.4.9.3,Indirect Effects on Wildlife,8.6.3,Summary and Causality Determination

We use a three dimensional global model of tropospheric chemistry driven by assimilated meteorological observations to investigate the origin of this background and to quantify its contribution to total surface O3 on both average and highly polluted summer days. The model simulation is evaluated with a suite of surface and aircraft observations over the United States from the summer of 1995. The model reproduces the principal features in the observed distributions of O3 and its precursors, including frequency distributions of O3 concentrations and the development of regional high-O3 episodes in the eastern United States. Comparison of simulations with 1995 versus 1980 global fossil fuel emissions indicates that the model captures the previously observed decrease in the high end of the O3 probability distribution in surface air over the United States (reflecting reduction of domestic hydrocarbon emissions) and the increase in the low end (reflecting, at least in the model, rising Asian emissions). In the model, background O3 produced outside of the North American boundary layer contributes an average 25-35 ppbv to afternoon O3 concentrations in surface air in the western United States. and 15-30 ppbv in the eastern United States during the summer of 1995. This background generally decays to below 15 ppbv during the stagnation conditions conducive to exceedances of the 8-hour 0.08 ppmv (80 ppbv) National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS) for O3. A high background contribution of 25-40 ppbv is found during 9% of these exceedances, reflecting convective mixing of free tropospheric O3 from aloft, followed by rapid production within the U.S. boundary layer. Anthropogenic emissions in Asia and Europe are found to increase afternoon O3 concentrations in surface air over the United States by typically 4-7 ppbv, under both average and highly polluted conditions. This enhancement is particularly large (up to 14 ppbv) for O3 concentrations in the 50-70 ppbv range, and would represent a major concern if the NAAQS were to be tightened.",0,0,1.8.1.2,Source Apportionment Approaches

Seedlings or ramets of the four species were subjected to chronic O3 exposures and designated leaves harvested periodically from emergence to senescence. Gas exchange was analysed, and concentrations of total soluble protein and ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase were measured as indicators of leaf senescence. Total antioxidant potential and ascorbate peroxidase and glutathione reductase activities also were determined. Black cherry and hybrid poplar exhibited O3-induced accelerated leaf senescence, whereas sugar maple and northern red oak did not. When the O3 effects were related to cumulative uptake of the gas, black cherry was the most sensitive of the four species. Although hybrid poplar exhibited similar symptoms of O3-induced accelerated senescence after the same exposure period as did black cherry, this species took up much greater quantities of O3 to achieve the same response. The O3-induced increase in glutathione reductase activity in hybrid poplar was consistent with the capacity of this species to take up high concentrations of the gas. Relative tolerance of northern red oak and sugar maple could be explained only in part by lower cumulative O3)> uptake and lower rate of uptake. Sugar maple had the highest antioxidant potential of all four species, which may have contributed to O3 tolerance of this species. Ascorbate peroxidase activity, when expressed on a fresh weight basis, could not account for differential sensitivity among the four species.",9.4.5,Water Cycling,8.2,Visible Foliar Injury and Biomonitoring

The assessment of the impact of O3 is facilitated by the use of a family of dose response models that covers the range of responses observed in field O3 dose response studies. The Weibull dose response model is a flexible, biologically realistic, model that has been found useful for this purpose. The purposes of this study are i) to discuss analyses of dose response data using the Weibull model and its extensions, ii) to identify some of the problems inherent in the use of a nonlinear dose response model, and iii) to show application of the model to two sets of experimental data. The basic Weibuil model is a modification of the Weibull probability distribution function. Extensions of the basic model allow for class variables and other continuous variables in the experimental design. A bivariate form of the Weibull allows for independent effects of two pollutants. The use of the Weibull model with class variables (cultivars) is demonstrated using a 1977 winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) experiment grown at Raleigh, NC involving four cultivars exposed to four levels of O3 pollution. Tests of homogeneity over cultivars of the proportional yield responses show differential cultivar response to O3. The bivariate Weibull model is demonstrated using a 1981 soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] experiment involving one cultivar exposed to the factorial set of treatments consisting of six levels of O3 and four levels of SO2 pollution. The test of lack of fit of the bivariate Weibuil model was nonsignificant, supporting the hypothesis that O3 and SO2 were acting independently.

An initial application of this model is illustrated for two species, wheat and beech. The model calculates ozone flux using European Monitoring and Evaluation Programme (EMEP) model ozone concentrations in combination with estimates of the atmospheric, boundary layer and stomatal resistances to ozone transfer. The model simulates the effect of phenology, irradiance, temperature, vapour pressure deficit and soil moisture deficit on stomatal conductance. These species-specific microclimatic parameters are derived from meteorological data provided by the Norwegian Meteorological Institute (DNMI), together with detailed land-use and soil type maps assembled at the Stockholm Environment Institute (SEI). Modelled fluxes are presented as mean monthly flux maps and compared with maps describing equivalent values of AOT40 (accumulated exposure over threshold of 40 ppb or nl l-1), highlighting the spatial differences between these two indices. In many cases high ozone fluxes were modelled in association with only moderate AOT40 values. The factors most important in limiting ozone uptake under the model assumptions were vapour pressure deficit (VPD), soil moisture deficit (for Mediterranean regions in particular) and phenology. The limiting effect of VPD on ozone uptake was especially apparent, since high VPDs resulting in stomatal closure tended to co-occur with high ozone concentrations. Although further work is needed to link the ozone uptake and deposition model components, and to validate the model with field measurements, the present results give a clear indication of the possible implications of adopting a flux-based approach for future policy evaluation.",9.5.4,Ozone Uptake/Dose Modeling for Vegetation,8.13.1,Exposure Indices

Reductions in productivity of crops and trees as seedlings are greater when plants are exposed to higher daytime ozone (O3 ) concentrations (0800-2000 hr standard time) or for longer durations. Primary evidence on the greater role of concentration comes from exposure-response experiments where plants are exposed to a series of pollutant concentrations in open-top chambers under field conditions. These studies demonstrate that the integrated exposure indices that give preferential weight to higher concentrations are better predictors of response than mean or peak indices. Evidence suggesting that mid-range O3 concentrations (0.05-0.09 parts per million, ppm) play a greater role than higher concentrations (>0.09 ppm) in biological response could not be justified. The time of day when O3 concentrations and atmospheric and stomatal conductances of gas exchange are optimal is a key to understanding plant response because plants respond only to O3 entering the leaf via stomata. A turbulent transfer model that describes the resistance of pollutant gas exchange from the atmosphere to the boundary layer of a forest canopy, as a function of micrometeorological variables, is developed to determine when flux of O3 is optimal. Based on meteorological and ambient air quality monitoring data at remote forest sites in the United States, it appears that O3 flux densities to the forest boundary layer are optimal during the 0800-2000 hr window. It is concluded that descriptors of ambient air quality for use in setting a federal standard should (1) cumulate hourly O3 concentrations, (2) give preferential weight to day-time concentrations between 0800 and 2000 hr, and (3) give preferential weight to higher O3 concentrations.",9.5.3.2,Diurnal and Seasonal Exposure,8.13.2,Exposure Response

The results are based on experimental data and on simulations with a Lagrangian tracer model. The model, employing analyzed meteorological data, advects a passive stratospheric ozone tracer through the calculation of a large number of three-dimensional trajectories. In two case studies, the model is evaluated using a comprehensive set of observation data, consisting of water vapor satellite images, total column ozone measurements, ozone soundings, and measurements of ozone, beryllium 7 and meteorological parameters at three high Alpine sites and at the highest peak in the northern Apennines. During the two episodes considered, stratospheric air was detectable in the whole Alpine area with peak ozone mixing ratios in the 70u90 ppb range and even penetrated into some valleys. During one episode, stratospheric air also reached the northern Apennines, which highlights the large extension of the affected region. At the end of this episode, as shown by the model, the air was a mixture of tropospheric air with air originating from three different stratospheric intrusions. For three high Alpine sites, the frequency of stratospheric intrusions and its seasonal variation is derived using ozone, beryllium 7 and humidity measurements. The periods covered by this climatology are 1991 to 1997 for Zugspitze, and 1996 to 1998 for Jungfraujoch and Sonnblick. Another short climatology was established from a three-year (1995u1997) model simulation. Good agreement between the two approaches is found for Zugspitze and Sonnblick: the simulated ozone tracer mixing ratios are significantly higher on ""intrusion days"", identified from the observations, than on ""non-intrusion days"". For Jungfraujoch, the agreement is less good, which could partly be due to the coarser time resolution of the beryllium 7 measurements at this site. The absolute frequency of stratospheric air intrusions as identified from the observations depends critically on the specification of threshold values for ozone, beryllium 7 and humidity, while the relative shape of the annual cycle is rather insensitive to threshold variations. At Zugspitze and Sonnblick, it shows a maximum in October, a secondary maximum in January and February, and a deep summer minimum. For Jungfraujoch, where the frequency of intrusions is higher than at Zugspitze and Sonnblick throughout most of the year, no clear seasonal variation is found. Simulated ozone tracer mixing ratios in the Alps are found to peak in late-winter/early-spring, when ozone concentrations are at a maximum in the stratosphere, but are almost at the same level in autumn, due to somewhat higher frequency of stratospheric intrusions in that season. Similar to the observations, there is a deep minimum in summer, when the model showed practically no intrusions with a tropospheric age of less than four days.",0,0,1.3.2.1,Tropopause Folding

No attempt has been made to determine which exposure-response models best fit the data sets examined. Hourly mean O3 concentration data, based on two-three measurements per hour, were used to develop indices of exposure from soybean and winter wheat experiments conducted in open-top chambers at the Boyce Thompson Institute, Ithaca, New York NCLAN field site. The comparative efficacy of cumulative indices (i.e. number of occurrences equal to or above specific hourly mean concentrations, sum of all hourly mean concentrations equal to or above a selected level, and the weighted sum of all hourly mean concentrations) and means calculated over an experimental period to describe the relationship between exposure to O3 and reductions in the yield of agricultural crops was evaluated. None of the exposure indices consistently provided a best fit with the Weibull and linear models tested. The selection of the model appears to be important in determining the indices that best describe the relationship between exposure and response. The focus of selecting a model should be on fitting the data points as well as on adequately describing biological responses. The investigator should be careful to couple the model with data points derived from indices relevant to the length of exposure. While we have used a small number of data sets, our analysis indicates that exposure indices that weight peak concentrations differently than lower concentrations of an exposure regime can be used in the development of exposure-response functions.

However, implementation of this approach requires the development of appropriate models which need to be rigorously tested against actual data collected under field conditions. This paper describes such an assessment of the stomatal component of the model described by Emberson et al. (2000. Modelling stomatal ozone flux across Europe. Environmental Pollution 110). Model predictions are compared with field measurements of both stomatal conductance (gs) and calculated ozone flux for shoots of mature Norway spruce (Picea abies) growing in the Tyrol Mountains in Austria. The model has been developed to calculate gs as a function of leaf phenology and four environmental variables: photosynthetic flux density (PFD), temperature, vapour pressure deficit (VPD) and soil moisture deficit (SMD). The model was run using climate data measured on site, although the SMD component was omitted since the necessary data were not available. The model parameterisation for Norway spruce had previously been collected from the scientific literature and therefore established independently from the measurement study. Overall, strong associations were found between model predictions and measured values of stomatal conductance to ozone (GO3) and calculated stomatal ozone flux (FO3). Average diurnal profiles of GO3 and FO3 showed good agreement between the field data and modelled values except during the morning period of 1990. The diurnal pattern of ozone flux was determined primarily by PFD and VPD, as there was little diurnal variation in ozone concentration. In general, the model predicted instances of high ozone flux satisfactorily, indicating its potential applicability in identifying areas of high ozone risk for this species.",9.5.4,Ozone Uptake/Dose Modeling for Vegetation,8.13.1,Exposure Indices

Nonlinear functions such as the Weibull function have been used extensively to model the effect of ozone (O3) exposure on yield of several crop species. The usual nonlinear regression model, which assumes independent errors, is not appropriate for data from nested or split-plot designs in which there is more than one source of random variation. The nonlinear model with variance components combines a nonlinear model for the mean with additive random effects to describe the covariance structure. We propose an estimated generalized least squares (EGLS) method of estimating the parameters for this model. This method is demonstrated and compared with results from ordinary nonlinear least squares for data from the National Crop Loss Assessment Network (NCLAN) program regarding the effects of O3 on soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.]. In this example, all methods give similar point estimates of the parameters of the Weibull function. The advantage of estimated generalized least squares is that it produces proper estimates of the variances of the parameters, estimated yields, and relative yield losses, which take the covariance structure into account. Model selection, hypothesis testing, and construction of confidence intervals are also demonstrated. A computer program that fits the nonlinear model with variance components by the EGLS method is available from the authors.

Considerable information from field studies conducted in the past decade indicate that there is poor functional correspondence between agricultural production and the air quality index of the current secondary NAAQS for O3. Because the current O3 NAAQS is based on data for extreme values of air quality, the index (or form) of the NAAQS ignores key features of hourly exposure data that are desirable and important to minimizing the risk of crop damage. Previous analyses of existing vegetation effects data indicate that exposure indices that cumulated the hourly O3  concentrations over the season, as well as preferentially weighted the higher concentrations appear to have major advantages over the mean and peak indices on the basis of statistical fits to the data. The peak-weighted, cumulative indicators whose form and level are determined from crop studies were found useful in achieving a target production level that is higher than that of the current O3 NAAQS indicator with fewer violations.

Old ozone measurements obtained at the Pic du Midi Observatory (3000 m high, southwestern France) were recently rediscovered. Four sets of data available at this station are presented herein: (1) 1874-1881 and (2) 1881-1909 by the Schonbein method and (3) 1982-1984 and (4) 1990-1993 by UV absorption analyzers. The results show an increase in ozone by a factor of 5 since the beginning of the twentieth century, corresponding to an exponential increase of 1.6% per year, although this trend is probably higher (2.4% per year) for the last few decades. A stable 10 ppb ozone mixing ratio is observed during the first 20 years of the series, which is representative of the preindustrial era ozone level. The increase is seen to start around 1895. Other data, obtained at various European high-altitude stations between 1920 and 1980, tie in closely with the Pic du Midi observations. A tentative evaluation of the impact of tropospheric ozone on radiative forcing confirms that ozone is currently the second most significant greenhouse gas, responsible for 22% and 13% of radiative forcing changes since 1800 in the Northern and Southern Hemispheres, respectively. If these rates were to be maintained in the future, ozone would continue to evolve differently in the two hemispheres (maximum level in the Northern Hemisphere) and could make an even more significant contribution to the radiative forcing of the Northern Hemisphere.",1.3.1,Background,9.1.1,Summary from the 213 Ozone ISA

The radiative impacts of NOx emissions were dependent on the location chosen for the emission pulse, whether at the surface or in the upper troposphere or whether in the northern or southern hemispheres. Global warming potentials were derived for each of the short-lived tropospheric ozone precursor species by integrating the methane and tropospheric ozone responses over a 100-year time horizon. Indirect radiative forcing due to methane and tropospheric ozone changes appear to be significant for all of the tropospheric ozone precursor species studied.Whereas the radiative forcing from methane changes is likely to be dominated by methane emissions, that from tropospheric ozone changes is controlled by all the tropospheric ozone precursor gases, particularly NOx emissions.

We present a first application of the model to the calculation of radiative forcing from tropospheric ozone since preindustrial times. Longwave and shortwave radiation fluxes are computed every 5 hours in the GCM using the locally simulated ozone fields. In this manner, the model resolves synoptic-scale correlations between ozone and meteorological variables. A simulation for present-day conditions is compared to a preindustrial atmosphere ( similar to 1800 A.D.) with no fossil fuel combustion, 10% of present-day biomass burning, and 0.7 ppm methane. The two simulations use the same meteorological fields; the radiative forcing does not feed back into the GCM. The model reproduces well the observed distributions of ozone and its precursors in the present-day atmosphere. Increases in ozone since preindustrial times are 20-200% depending on region and season. The global mean, instantaneous radiative forcing from anthropogenic ozone is 0.44 W m(2) (0.35 longwave, 0.09 shortwave). The model reveals large shortwave forcings (0.3-0.7 W m(2) ) over polar regions in summer. The total forcing is greater than 1.0 W m(2) over large areas, including the Arctic, during Northern Hemisphere summer. The normalized radiative forcing per unit of added ozone column varies globally from -0.01 to 0.05 W m(2) . This variance can be explained in large part by the temperature difference between the surface and the tropopause; clouds are an additional factor, particularly at low latitudes. An off-line radiative calculation using the same ozone fields but averaged monthly shows nearly identical forcings, with differences less than plus or minus 2% over most of the Earth. The similarity between the off-line and on-line simulations suggests that the common use of off-line ozone fields is acceptable in radiative forcing calculations. Addition of the direct forcings from anthropogenic sulfate aerosol and tropospheric ozone computed with the same GCM shows compensating effects, with sulfate dominating at northern midlatitudes and ozone usually dominating elsewhere.",1.3.3.2,The Effect of Surface Albedo on O3 Radiative Forcing,9.1.1,Summary from the 213 Ozone ISA

Aphid growth and development (relative growth rate (RGR), development time, adult weight, embryo number and the birth weight of newborn nymphs) were unaffected by CO2 and O3. Aphid fecundity decreased on trees grown at elevated CO2, O3 and CO2 + O3. Neither nymphal performance nor adult size were reliable indicators of future fecundity at elevated CO2 and/or O3. Aphid populations protected from natural enemies were unaffected by elevated CO2. but increased significantly at elevated O3. Individual fecundity in elevated CO2 and O3 atmospheres did not predict population growth rates, probably because of changes in the strength of intraspecific competition or the ability of the aphids to induce nutrient sinks. Natural aphid, predator and parasitoids populations (Year 2) showed few significant responses to CO2 and O3, although CO2 and O3 did affect the timing of aphid and natural enemy peak abundance. Elevated CO2 and O3 affected aphid and natural enemy populations independently: no CO2 x O3 interactions were observed.

Westman (1979, 1981) suggested that air pollution induced successional changes that were occurring in the coastal sage scrub communities of southern California. Air pollution differentially affects the survival, growth, and reproduction of the species making up a plant community. These impacts influence the competitive relationships among the species. Our ability to predict successional changes and eventual steady-state communities under conditions of chronic oxidant air pollution has been limited by the relatively short period that ecologists have had to observe this phenomenon. We are also limited in our ability to predict how patterns of plant succession will change in the future once chronic air pollution has been eliminated. It is important that we grapple with these questions to understand the potential impacts of the current episode of air pollution on the forests of southern California. An understanding of these impacts can inform forest managers and conservation biologists of the need to develop management strategies for the protection of vulnerable species and vegetation types.

The fully coupled gas-aerosol unified GCM allows one to evaluate the extent to which global burdens, radiative forcing, and eventually climate feedbacks of ozone and aerosols are influenced by gas-aerosol chemical interactions. Estimated present-day global burdens of sea salt and mineral dust are 6.93 and 18.1 Tg with lifetimes of 0.4 and 3.9 days, respectively. The GCM is applied to estimate current top of atmosphere (TOA) and surface radiative forcing by tropospheric ozone and all natural and anthropogenic aerosol components. The global annual mean value of the radiative forcing by tropospheric ozone is estimated to be +0.53 W m-2 at TOA and +0.07 W m-2 at the Earth's surface. Global, annual average TOA and surface radiative forcing by all aerosols are estimated as -0.72 and -4.04 W m-2, respectively. While the predicted highest aerosol cooling and heating at TOA are -10 and +12 W m-2, respectively, surface forcing can reach values as high as -30 W m-2, mainly caused by the absorption by black carbon, mineral dust, and OC. We also estimate the effects of chemistry-aerosol coupling on forcing estimates based on currently available understanding of heterogeneous reactions on aerosols. Through altering the burdens of sulfate, nitrate, and ozone, heterogeneous reactions are predicted to change the global mean TOA forcing of aerosols by 17% and influence global mean TOA forcing of tropospheric ozone by 15%.",1.3.3.2,The Effect of Surface Albedo on O3 Radiative Forcing,9.1.1,Summary from the 213 Ozone ISA

Using a general circulation model, we have carried out a pair of equilibrium climate simulations with realistic present-day and preindustrial ozone distributions. We find that the instantaneous radiative forcing of 0.49 W m(-2) due to the increase in tropospheric ozone since preindustrial times results in an increase in global mean surface temperature of 0.28degreesC. The increase is nearly 0.4degreesC in the Northern Hemisphere and about 0.2degreesC in the Southern Hemisphere. The largest increases (&gt;0.8degreesC) are downwind of Europe and Asia and over the North American interior in summer. In the lower stratosphere, global mean temperatures decrease by about 0.2degreesC due to the diminished upward flux of radiation at 9.6 mum. The largest stratospheric cooling, up to 1.0degreesC, occurs over high northern latitudes in winter, with possibly important implications for the formation of polar stratospheric clouds. To identify the characteristics of climate forcing unique to tropospheric ozone, we have conducted two additional climate equilibrium simulations: one in which preindustrial tropospheric ozone concentrations were increased everywhere by 18 ppb, producing the same global radiative forcing as present-day ozone but without the heterogeneity; and one in which CO2 was decreased by 25 ppm relative to present day, with ozone at present-day values, to again produce the same global radiative forcing but with the spectral signature of CO2 rather than ozone. In the first simulation (uniform increase of ozone), the global mean surface temperature increases by 0.25degreesC, with an interhemispheric difference of only 0.03degreesC, as compared with nearly 0.2degreesC for the heterogeneous ozone increase. In the second simulation (equivalent CO2), the global mean surface temperature increases by 0.36degreesC, 30% higher than the increase from tropospheric ozone. The stronger surface warming from CO2 is in part because CO2 forcing (obscured by water vapor) is shifted relatively poleward where the positive ice-albedo feedback amplifies the climate response and in part because the magnitude of the CO2 forcing in the midtroposphere is double that of ozone. However, we find that CO2 is far less effective than tropospheric ozone in driving lower stratospheric cooling at high northern latitudes in winter.",1.3.2.1,Climate Change in the Recent Past,9.1.1,Summary from the 213 Ozone ISA

We examined how the dynamics of nutrient release from leaf litter responded to two important atmospheric changes: rising atmospheric CO2 and tropospheric O3. We evaluated the independent and combined effects of these gases on foliar litter nutrient dynamics in aspen (Populus tremuloides Michx) and birch (Betula papyrifera Marsh)/aspen communities at the Aspen FACE Project in Rhinelander, WI. Naturally senesced leaf litter was incubated in litter bags in the field for 735 days. Decomposing litter was sampled six times during incubation and was analyzed for carbon, and both macro (N, P, K, S, Ca, and Mg) and micro (Mn, B, Zn and Cu) nutrient concentrations. Elevated CO2 significantly decreased the initial litter concentrations of N (?10.7%) and B (?14.4%), and increased the concentrations of K (+23.7%) and P (+19.7%), with no change in the other elements. Elevated O3 significantly decreased the initial litter concentrations of P (?11.2%), S (?8.1%), Ca (?12.1%), and Zn (?19.5%), with no change in the other elements.

As such processes may differ among experimental plots there is a risk that effects of experimental treatments are confounded. Here we report on a free-air ozone-exposure experiment in permanent semi-natural grassland that suggested strong ozone effects on community productivity after 5 years. We tested ozone effects and investigated the potential of confounding due to changes in nutrient management. Repeated-measure ANOVA revealed mainly negative temporal trends for frequency of abundant productive plant species. Constrained ordination additionally showed converging trajectories of species compositions for ozone and control treatments with time. Yields sampled prior to the start of the experiment and soil nitrogen concentrations revealed that spatial heterogeneity in the soil nutrient status was not accounted for by the random allocation of treatments to plots with a bias towards less productive patches in the elevated-ozone plots. Re-analysis of yield data using repeated-measure ANOVA with a covariable to account for productivity prior to the start of fumigation revealed effects on the temporal changes in total yield and yield of legumes that cannot be separated between ozone and pre-treatment nutrient status. Changes in species composition favour an ecological interpretation with spatial heterogeneity as the major cause of different yield declines. Although elevated ozone may cause subtle physiological changes with longer term implications, our new results suggest that species-rich mature grassland such as the one studied at Le Mouret may be less sensitive to elevated ozone than previously assumed.

All three grids predict that ozone production is limited primarily by the availability of NOx, and yield similar predictions of average ozone sensitivity to both regional and local emissions of NOx. However, in urban areas, the coarsest (36-km) resolution fails to capture the extent and magnitude of VOC sensitivity and underpredicts the nonlinearity of ozone response indicated by the finest resolution. Medium (12-km) resolution is sufficient to reproduce most features of ozone response, except for the texture of local variability.

Simulated ozone effects included reductions in stomatal conductance and plant N demand. Model uncertainty was evaluated using Monte Carlo simulations. Ambient ozone was estimated to cause an additional 0.042 gN/m(2) per year of nitrate export, 12% of the mean annual streamflow nitrate flux. The 95% credible interval of this estimate was 0.002-0.083 gN/m(2) per year, or 0.72-27.3% of the annual flux.

The models used mid-range A1B emission scenarios, independently calculated the resulting composition change, and then performed transient simulations to 2050 examining the response to projected changes in short-lived species and to changes in both long-lived and short-lived species together. By 2050, two models show that the global mean annual average warming due to long-lived GHGs (greenhouse gases) is enhanced by 20?25% due to the radiatively active short-lived species. One model shows virtually no effect from short-lived species. Intermodel differences are largely related to differences in emissions projections for short-lived species, which are substantial even for a particular storyline. For aerosols, these uncertainties are usually dominant, though for sulfate uncertainties in aerosol physics are also substantial. For tropospheric ozone, uncertainties in physical processes are more important than uncertainties in precursor emissions. Differences in future atmospheric burdens and radiative forcing for aerosols are dominated by divergent assumptions about emissions from South and East Asia. In all three models, the spatial distribution of radiative forcing is less important than that of climate sensitivity in predicting climate impact. Both short-lived and long-lived species appear to cause enhanced climate responses in the same regions of high sensitivity rather than short-lived species having an enhanced effect primarily near polluted areas. Since short-lived species can significantly influence climate, regional air quality emission control strategies for short-lived pollutants may substantially impact climate over large (e.g., hemispheric) scales.

We find a substantial range in the 'efficacy' of different forcings, where the efficacy is the global temperature response per unit forcing relative to the response to CO sub(2) forcing. Anthropogenic CH sub(4) has efficacy similar to 110%, which increases to similar to 145% when its indirect effects on stratospheric H sub(2)O and tropospheric O sub(3) are included, yielding an effective climate forcing of similar to 0.8 W/m super(2) for the period 1750-2000 and making CH sub(4) the largest anthropogenic climate forcing other than CO sub(2). Black carbon (BC) aerosols from biomass burning have a calculated efficacy similar to 58%, while fossil fuel BC has an efficacy similar to 78%. Accounting for forcing efficacies and for indirect effects via snow albedo and cloud changes, we find that fossil fuel soot, defined as BC + OC (organic carbon), has a net positive forcing while biomass burning BC + OC has a negative forcing. We show that replacement of the traditional instantaneous and adjusted forcings, Fi and Fa, with an easily computed alternative, Fs, yields a better predictor of climate change, i.e., its efficacies are closer to unity. Fs is inferred from flux and temperature changes in a fixed-ocean model run. There is remarkable congruence in the spatial distribution of climate change, normalized to the same forcing Fs, for most climate forcing agents, suggesting that the global forcing has more relevance to regional climate change than may have been anticipated. Increasing greenhouse gases intensify the Hadley circulation in our model, increasing rainfall in the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ), Eastern United States, and East Asia, while intensifying dry conditions in the subtropics including the Southwest United States, the Mediterranean region, the Middle East, and an expanding Sahel. These features survive in model simulations that use all estimated forcings for the period 1880-2000. Responses to localized forcings, such as land use change and heavy regional concentrations of BC aerosols, include more specific regional characteristics. We suggest that anthropogenic tropospheric O sub(3) and the BC snow albedo effect contribute substantially to rapid warming and sea ice loss in the Arctic. As a complement to a priori forcings, such as Fi, Fa, and Fs, we tabulate the a posteriori effective forcing, Fe, which is the product of the forcing and its efficacy. Fe requires calculation of the climate response and introduces greater model dependence, but once it is calculated for a given amount of a forcing agent it provides a good prediction of the response to other forcing amounts.

As abiotic factors rapidly change habitat suitability, projections range from altered genetic diversity to wide-spread species loss. Here, we assess the degree to which changes in atmospheric composition associated with environmental change will influence not only the abundance, but also the genotypic/phenotypic diversity, of herbivore populations. Using free-air CO2 and O-3 enrichment (FACE) technology, we assess numerical responses of pea aphids (Acyrthosiphon pisum) exhibiting a pink-green genetic polymorphism and an environmentally determined wing polyphenism on broad bean plants (Vicia faba) under enriched CO2 and/or O-3 atmospheres, over multiple generations. We show that these two greenhouse gases alter not only aphid population sizes, but also genotypic and phenotypic frequencies. As the green genotype was positively influenced by elevated CO2 levels, but the pink genotype was not, genotypic frequencies (pink morph : green morph) ranged from 1 : 1 to 9 : 1. These two genotypes also displayed marked differences in phenotypic frequencies. The pink genotype exhibited higher levels of wing induction under all atmospheric treatments, however, this polyphenism was negatively influenced by elevated O-3 levels. Resultantly, frequencies of winged phenotypes (pink morph : green morph) varied from 10 : 1 to 332 : 1.

At the beginning of the OTC experiment, all trees were 7 years old. We studied the single and interaction effects of CO2 and O-3 on silver birch below-ground carbon pools (i.e. effects on fine roots and mycorrhizas, soil microbial communities and sporocarp production) and also assessed whether there are any clonal differences in these below-ground CO2 and O-3 responses. The total mycorrhizal infection level of both clones was stimulated by elevated CO2 alone and elevated O-3 alone, but not when elevated CO2 was used in fumigation in combination with elevated O-3. In both clones, elevated CO2 affected negatively light brown/orange mycorrhizas, while its effect on other mycorrhizal morphotypes was negligible. Elevated O-3, instead, clearly decreased the proportions of black and liver-brown mycorrhizas and increased that of light brown/orange mycorrhizas. Elevated O-3 had a tendency to decrease standing fine root mass and sporocarp production as well, both of these O-3 effects mainly manifesting in clone 4 trees. CO2 and O-3 treatment effects on soil microbial community composition (PLFA, 2- and 3-OH-FA profiles) were negligible, but quantitative PLFA data showed that in 2001 the PLFA fungi : bacteria-ratio of clone 80 trees was marginally increased because of elevated CO2 treatments. This study shows that O-3 effects were most clearly visible at the mycorrhizal root level and that some clonal differences in CO2 and O-3 responses were observable in the below-ground carbon pools. In conclusion, the present data suggests that CO2 effects were minor, whereas increasing tropospheric O-3 levels can be an important stress factor in northern birch forests, as they might alter mycorrhizal morphotype assemblages, mycorrhizal infection rates and sporocarp production.",9.4.7.3,Microbes,8.1.2,Microbes

Recent progress in research on the molecular and metabolic control of the effective O-3 dose is reported along with advances in empirically assessing O-3 uptake at the whole-tree and stand level. Knowledge on both O-3 uptake and effective dose (measures of stress avoidance and tolerance, respectively) needs to be understood mechanistically and linked as a pre-requisite before practical use of process-based O-3 risk assessment can be implemented.

The hypotheses tested were (1) that the competitiveness of beech rather than spruce is negatively affected by the exposure to enhanced O-3 concentrations, (2) spruce benefits from the increase of resource availability (elevated CO2) in the mixed culture and (3) that the responsiveness of plants to CO2 and O-3 depends on the type of competition (i.e. intra vs. interspecific). Beech displayed a competitive disadvantage when growing in mixture with spruce: after two growing seasons under interspecific competition, beech showed significant reductions in leaf gas exchange, biomass development and crown volume as compared with beech plants growing in monoculture. In competition with spruce, beech appeared to be nitrogen (N)-limited, whereas spruce tended to benefit in terms of its plant N status. The responsiveness of the juvenile trees to the atmospheric treatments differed between species and was dominated by the type of competition: spruce growth benefited from elevated CO2 concentrations, while beech growth suffered from the enhanced O-3 regime. In general, interspecific competition enhanced these atmospheric treatment effects, supporting our hypotheses. Significant differences in root : shoot biomass ratio between the type of competition under both elevated O-3 and CO2 were not caused by readjustments of biomass partitioning, but were dependent on tree size.

To increase the stress, S. asper was germinated and raised in the continuous presence of an elevated level of ozone.

Our database consisted of 63 studies conducted on 22 species of trees and published between 1990 and 2005. Ozone alone had no overall effect on concentrations of carbohydrates or nutrients, whereas in combination with CO2, elevated O3 reduced nutrient concentrations and increased carbohydrate concentrations. In contrast to primary metabolites, concentrations of phenolics and terpenes were significantly increased by 16% and 8%, respectively, in response to elevated O3. Effects of ozone in combination with elevated CO2 were weaker than those of ozone alone on phenolics, but stronger than those of ozone alone on terpenes. The magnitude of secondary metabolite responses depended on the type of ozone exposure facility and increased in the following order: indoor growth chamber < open-top chamber < free-air ozone exposure. The results of meta-analysis demonstrated that, in terms of leaf chemistry, angiosperms are more responsive to elevated O3 than gymnosperms, as shifts in concentrations of carbohydrate and phenolics were observed in the former, but not in the latter. Elevated O3 had positive effects on some indices of insect performance: pupal mass increased and larval development time shortened, but these effects were counteracted by elevated CO2. Therefore, despite the observed increase in secondary metabolites, elevated O3 tends to increase tree foliage quality for herbivores, but elevated CO2 may alleviate these effects.

We observed year-to-year variation in N transformation rates, which peaked during a period of foliar insect damage. Elevated CO2 caused equivalent increases in gross rates of N mineralization (+34%) and NH4+ immobilization (+36%). These results indicate greater rates of N turnover under elevated CO2, but do not indicate a negative feedback between elevated CO2 and soil N availability. Elevated O-3 decreased gross N mineralization (-16%) and had no effect on NH4+ immobilization, indicating reduced N availability under elevated O-3. The effects of CO2 and O-3 on N mineralization rates were mainly related to changes in litter production, whereas effects on N immobilization were likely influenced by changes in litter chemistry and production.

Our results suggest that the increasing O-3 and/or CO2 concentrations may affect the N2O, CH4 and CO2 fluxes from the soil, but longer study periods are needed to verify the actual consequences of climate change for greenhouse gas emissions.

Ozone (O-3)exposed plants show an increased production and rapid accumulation of salicylic acid (SA), which amplifies the initial oxidative signal. SA is also involved in the defense pathway induced by aphid attack. The signal is transmitted throughout the plant, establishing communication among different plant tissues. Here, we discuss experimental and conceptual advances and limitations of cross talk between responses to O-3 and aphids and we make a case for the need of studies at a large scale with enough and sufficient complexity to assess interactions at the individual organism and population levels. We further hypothesize that stress frequency, intensity, duration and timing, will affect the direction of response to aphid herbivory of increased-O-3-exposed plants. In the long term, frequent high O-3 exposures might allow the selection Of O-3-resistant plants that do not accumulate reactive oxygen species, preventing the induction of defenses against aphid attack.

A 5-year field experiment was carried out at a rural, mid-elevation site at Le Mouret (Switzerland) to investigate the effect of elevated O-3 on yield and species composition of a permanent, extensively managed, species-rich old pasture. Using a free-air fumigation system, circular plots of 7 m diameter were exposed to either ambient air (control plots) or to air containing O-3 of approximately 1.5 x ambient concentrations. The resulting accumulated O-3 exposure over the threshold of 40 ppb for one season ranged from 13.3 to 59.5 ppm h in the elevated O-3 plots, and from 1.0 to 20.7 ppm h in the control plots. Subplots in each ring were harvested three times each year, and harvested biomass was separated into functional groups (FGs) (grasses, legumes, forbs). Productivity in both treatments decreased over time, but the yield of O-3-exposed plots decreased faster than that of the control plots, with the reduction being twice as large by the end of the fifth season. Compared with the ambient air control, loss in annual dry matter yield was 23% after 5 years. The change in annual biomass production because of O-3 stress was accompanied by a change in the fractions of FGs, with the legume fraction showing a strong negative response. Such long-term effects of O-3 stress could have negative implications for the maintenance of biological diversity in rural landscapes across large areas of Europe. The results from this first long-term experiment show that a moderately elevated O-3 level reduces the productivity of intact grasslands during a 5-year exposure under real field conditions.",9.4.4.2,Crop Quality,8.1.1.2,Grassland and Agricultural Land

The results suggested that elevated [O-3] decreased wheat grain yield by 29% (CI: 24-34%) and aboveground biomass by 18% (CI: 13-24%), where CI is the 95% confidence interval. Even in studies where the [O-3] range was between 31 and 59 ppb (average 43 ppb), there was a significant decrease in the grain yield (18%) and biomass (16%) relative to CF. Despite the increase in the grain protein content (6.8%), elevated [O-3] significantly decreased the grain protein yield (-18%). Relative to CF, elevated [O-3] significantly decreased photosynthetic rates (-20%), Rubisco activity (-19%), stomatal conductance (-22%), and chlorophyll content (-40%). For the whole plant, rising [O-3] induced a larger decrease in belowground (-27%) biomass than in aboveground (-18%) biomass. There was no significant response difference between spring wheat and winter wheat. Wheat grown in the field showed larger decreases in leaf photosynthesis parameters than wheat grown in < 5 L pots. Open-top chamber fumigation induced a larger reduction than indoor growth chambers, when plants were exposed to elevated [O-3]. The detrimental effect was progressively greater as the average daily [O-3] increased, with very few exceptions. The impact of O-3 increased with developmental stages, with the largest detrimental impact during grain filling.

The field consists of eight circular plots of which four were fumigated with elevated ozone concentration and four were ambient controls. At the latter part of the first growing season (week 33, 2003), the methane emission was 159 +/- 14 mg CH4 m(-2) day(-1) (mean +/- SE) in the ozone treatment and 214 +/- 8 mg CH4 m(-2) day(-1) under the ambient control. However, towards the end of the experiment the ozone treatment slightly, but consistently, enhanced the methane emission. At the end of the third growing season (2005), microbial biomass (estimated by phospholipid fatty acid biomarkers) was higher in peat exposed to ozone (1975 +/- 108 nmol g(-1) dw) than in peat of the control microcosms (1589 +/- 115 nmol g(-1) dw). The concentrations of organic acids in peat pore water showed a similar trend. Elevated ozone did not affect the shoot length or the structure of the sedge E. vaginatum leaves but it slightly increased the total number of sedge leaves towards the end of the experiment. Our results indicate that elevated ozone concentration enhances the general growth conditions of microbes in peat by increasing their substrate availability. However, the methane production did not reflect the increase in the concentration of organic acids, probably because hydrogenotrophic methane production dominated in the peat studied.

CO2 + 300 mu l CO2 l(-1)) in a full factorial design. Saplings were analysed for various mineral nutrients in different plant organs as well as biomass production and crown development. The study was based on the assumption that nutritional parameters important for growth and competitiveness are affected by stress defence under limiting nutrient supply. The hypotheses tested were (1) that nutrient uptake-related parameters (a) as well as efficiencies in nutrient use for above-ground competition (b) of beech rather than spruce are impaired by the exposure to elevated O-3 concentrations, (2) that the efficiency in nutrient uptake of spruce is enhanced by elevated CO2 concentrations in mixed culture, and (3) that the ability to occupy above-ground space at low nutrient cost is co-determinant for the competitive success in mixed culture. Clear nitrogen deficiencies were indicated for both species during the 2-year phytotron study, although foliar nitrogen-biomass relationships were not so close for spruce than for beech. O-3 stress did not impair nutrient uptake-related parameters of beech; thus hypothesis (1a). was not supported. A negative effect of elevated O-3 (under amb. CO2) on the N and P based efficiencies in above-ground space occupation (i.e. lower crown volume per unit of N or P invested in stems, limbs and foliage) of beech supported hypothesis (1b). It appeared that ozone stress triggered a nutrient demand for stress defence and tolerance at the expense of above-ground competition (trade-off). Crown volume of beech under O-3 stress was stabilized in monoculture by increased nutrient uptake. In general, the +CO2-treatment was able to counteract the impacts of 2 X O-3. Elevated CO2 caused lower N and S concentrations in current-year foliage of both tree species, slightly higher macronutrient amounts in the root biomass of spruce, but did not increase the efficiencies in nutrient uptake of spruce in mixed culture. Therefore hypothesis (2) was not supported. At the end of the experiment spruce turned out to be the stronger competitor in mixed culture as displayed by its higher total shoot biomass and crown volume. The amounts of macronutrients in the above-ground biomass of spruce individuals in mixed culture distinctly exceeded those of beech, which had been strongly reduced by interspecific competition.

Ozone is produced by the photo-oxidation of hydrocarbons released into the atmosphere by combustion of fossil fuels. Studies demonstrate O-3 can be transported from metropolitan areas to rural areas important to agricultural and forestry practices. Reports regarding O-3 effects have focused on vegetation important to food production or agronomic crops of economic importance. However, relatively little is known about O-3 effects on native plant species. The effects of tropospheric O-3 on two warm-season grasses, eastern gamagrass (Tripsacum dactyloides L.) and big bluestem (Andropogon gerardii Vitman), were examined during June-September of 2003. Plants were fumigated with three levels of O-3 in a randomized-block experiment with three replicates of each treatment. Grasses were grown in open-top chambers with introduced carbon-filtered (CF) air, characteristic of clean air quality; non-filtered (NF) air, representative of quality in Auburn, AL; and air with double (2X) the ambient concentration of O-3. Because forage quality can be as important as quantity, we determined various effects on nutritive quality characteristics in addition to biomass yield. Big bluestem exhibited little response to O-3 exposure. For eastern gamagrass, we generally found decreased nutritive quality with increasing O-3 exposure as evidenced by increased concentrations of cell wall constituents and decreased concentrations of N. Regrowth of both species exhibited little treatment effect which emphasizes the importance of timing and duration of O-3 exposures in relation to physiological stage of plant development. Decreased nutritive quality parameters observed for eastern gamagrass may have implications to diet selection and nutrient intake by ruminant herbivores. In addition, range managers can use species-specific information regarding O-3 sensitivity to make decisions about mechanical harvesting and grazing regimes of these forages growing in areas exposed to elevated O-3 concentrations.",9.4.4.2,Crop Quality,8.3.1,Declines in Growth Rates

Considerable increases in yield are required over this century to continue feeding the world's growing population. This meta-analysis synthesizes the research to date on rice responses to two elements of global change, rising atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration ([CO2]) and rising tropospheric ozone concentration ([O-3]). On an average, elevated [CO2] (627 ppm) increased rice yields by 23%. Modest increases in grain mass and larger increases in panicle and grain number contributed to this response. The response of rice to elevated [CO2] varied with fumigation technique. The more closely the fumigation conditions mimicked field conditions, the smaller was the stimulation of yield by elevated [CO2]. Free air concentration enrichment (FACE) experiments showed only a 12% increase in rice yield. The rise in atmospheric [CO2] will be accompanied by increases in tropospheric O-3 and temperature. When compared with rice grown in charcoal-filtered air, rice exposed to 62 ppb O-3 showed a 14% decrease in yield. Many determinants of yield, including photosynthesis, biomass, leaf area index, grain number and grain mass, were reduced by elevated [O-3]. While there have been too few studies of the interaction of CO2 and O-3 for meta-analysis, the interaction of temperature and CO2 has been studied more widely.

This phenomenon was observed in plants grown both with and without supplemental soil moisture, the latter of which should theoretically mitigate against harmful physiological effects caused by exposure to ozone. Seasonally declining rates of stomatal conductance were found to be substantial and incorporated into models, making them less susceptible to the overestimations of effective exposure that are an inherent source of error in ozone exposure indices.

Soil respiration is the second largest flux of carbon (C) in these ecosystems, and the objective of this study was to understand how soil respiration responded to the experimental treatments as these fast-growing stands of pure aspen and birch + aspen approached maximum leaf area. Rates of soil respiration were typically lowest in the elevated O-3 treatment. Elevated CO2 significantly stimulated soil respiration (8-26%) compared to the control treatment in both community types over all three growing seasons. In years 6-7 of the experiment, the greatest rates of soil respiration occurred in the interaction treatment (CO2 + O-3), and rates of soil respiration were 15-25% greater in this treatment than in the elevated CO2 treatment, depending on year and community type. Two of the treatments, elevated CO2 and elevated CO2 + O-3, were fumigated with C-13-depleted CO2, and in these two treatments we used standard isotope mixing models to understand the proportions of new and old C in soil respiration. During the peak of the growing season, C fixed since the initiation of the experiment in 1998 (new C) accounted for 60-80% of total soil respiration. The isotope measurements independently confirmed that more new C was respired from the interaction treatment compared to the elevated CO2 treatment. A period of low soil moisture late in the 2003 growing season resulted in soil respiration with an isotopic signature 4-6 parts per thousand enriched in 13 stopC compared to sample dates when the percentage soil moisture was higher.

Because soil microorganisms depend on plant litter as a source of energy for metabolism, changes in the amount or the biochemistry of plant litter produced under elevated CO2 and O3 could alter microbial community function and composition. Previously, we have observed that elevated CO2 increased the microbial metabolism of cellulose and chitin, whereas elevated O3 dampened this response. We hypothesized that this change in metabolism under CO2 and O3 enrichment would be accompanied by a concomitant change in fungal community composition. We tested our hypothesis at the free-air CO2 and O3 enrichment (FACE) experiment at Rhinelander, Wisconsin, in which Populus tremuloides, Betula papyrifera, and Acer saccharum were grown under factorial CO2 and O3 treatments. We employed extracellular enzyme analysis to assay microbial metabolism, phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) analysis to determine changes in microbial community composition, and polymerase chain reaction?denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (PCR?DGGE) to analyze the fungal community composition. The activities of 1,4-?-glucosidase (+37%) and 1,4,-?-N-acetylglucosaminidase (+84%) were significantly increased under elevated CO2, whereas 1,4-?-glucosidase activity (?25%) was significantly suppressed by elevated O3. There was no significant main effect of elevated CO2 or O3 on fungal relative abundance, as measured by PLFA. We identified 39 fungal taxonomic units from soil using DGGE, and found that O3 enrichment significantly altered fungal community composition. We conclude that fungal metabolism is altered under elevated CO2 and O3, and that there was a concomitant change in fungal community composition under elevated O3.

Fumigation treatments consisted of replicated ambient, +CO2, +O3, and +CO2 + O3 FACE rings. We followed mass loss and litter chemistry over 23 months, using reciprocally transplanted litterbags to separate substrate quality from environment effects. Aspen decayed more slowly than birch across all treatment conditions, and changes in decomposition dynamics of both species were driven by shifts in substrate quality rather than by fumigation environment. Aspen litter produced under elevated CO2 decayed more slowly than litter produced under ambient CO2, and this effect was exacerbated by elevated O3. Similarly, birch litter produced under elevated CO2 also decayed more slowly than litter produced under ambient CO2. In contrast to results for aspen, however, elevated O3 accelerated birch decay under ambient CO2, but decelerated decay under enriched CO2. Changes in decomposition rates (k-values) were due to CO2- and O3-mediated shifts in litter quality, particularly levels of carbohydrates, nitrogen, and tannins.

With multidecadal full-chemistry transient simulations in the MOZART-2 tropospheric chemistry model, we show that tropospheric O-3 responds approximately linearly to changes in CH4 emissions over a range of anthropogenic emissions from 0-430 Tg CH4 a(-1) (0.11-0.16 Tg tropospheric O-3 or similar to 11-15 ppt global mean surface O-3 decrease per Tg a(-1) CH4 reduced). We find that neither the air quality nor climate benefits depend strongly on the location of the CH4 emission reductions, implying that the lowest cost emission controls can be targeted. With a series of future (2005-2030) transient simulations, we demonstrate that cost-effective CH4 controls would offset the positive climate forcing from CH4 and O-3 that would otherwise occur (from increases in NOx and CH4 emissions in the baseline scenario) and improve O-3 air quality. We estimate that anthropogenic CH4 contributes 0.7 Wm(-2) to climate forcing and similar to 4 ppb to surface O-3 in 2030 under the baseline scenario. Although the response of surface O-3 to CH4 is relatively uniform spatially compared to that from other O-3 precursors, it is strongest in regions where surface air mixes frequently with the free troposphere and where the local O-3 formation regime is NOx-saturated. In the model, CH4 oxidation within the boundary layer (below similar to 2.5 km) contributes more to surface O-3 than CH4 oxidation in the free troposphere. In NOx-saturated regions, the surface O-3 sensitivity to CH4 can be twice that of the global mean, with &gt; 70% of this sensitivity resulting from boundary layer oxidation of CH4.

Much work has been done to assess the impacts of these pollutants on trees, but little is known about how the diverse understory flora has fared. Understory vegetation has declined in diversity in response to elevated N in the eastern U.S. and Europe. Six sites along an ozone and N deposition gradient that had been part of a long-term study on response of plants to air pollution beginning in 1973 were resampled in 2003. Historic ozone data and leaf injury scores confirmed the gradient. Present-day ozone levels were almost half of these, and recent atmospheric N pollution concentrations confirmed the continued air pollution gradient. Both total and extractable soil N were higher in sites on the western end of the gradient closer to the urban source of pollution, pH was lower, and soil carbon (C) and litter were higher. The gradient also had decreasing precipitation and increasing elevation from west to east. However, the dominant tree species were the same across the gradient. Tree basal area increased during the 30-year interval in five of the sites. The two westernmost sites had 30-45% cover divided equally between native and exotic understory herbaceous species, while the other sites had only 3-13% cover dominated by native species. The high production is likely related to higher precipitation at the western sites as well as elevated N. The species richness was in the range of 24 to 30 in four of the sites, but one site of intermediate N deposition had 42 species, while the easternmost, least polluted site had 57 species. These were primarily native species, as no site had more than one to three exotic species. In three of six sites, 20-40% of species were lost between 1973 and 2003, including the two westernmost sites. Two sites with intermediate pollution had little change in total species number over 30 years, and the easternmost site had more species in 2003. The easternmost site is also the driest and has the most sunlight filtering to the forest floor, possibly accounting for the higher species richness. The confounding effects of the precipitation gradient and possibly local disturbances do not show a simple correlation of air pollution with patterns of native and invasive species cover and richness. Nevertheless, the decline of native species and dominance by exotic species in the two westernmost polluted sites is cause for concern that air pollution is affecting the understory vegetation adversely.",9.4.7.1,Forest,8.1.1.1,Forest

Ozone is known to occur in the Mexico City Metropolitan Area and elsewhere as the cause of chlorotic mottling on pine needles that are 2 years old or older as observed in 1976 on Pinus hartwegii and Pinus leiophylla. Visible evidences for the negative effects of ozone on the vegetation of central Mexico include foliar injury expressed as chlorotic mottling and premature defoliation on pines, a general decline of sacred fir, visible symptoms on native forest broadleaved species (e.g. Mexican black cherry). Recent investigations have also indicated that indirect effects are occurring such as limited root colonization by symbiotic fungi on ozone-damaged P. hartwegii trees and a negative influence of the pollutant on the natural regeneration of this species.

Meta-analysis of the ozone sensitivity data showed a wide inter-specific range in response to ozone. Some relationships in comparison to plant physiological and ecological characteristics were identified. Plants of the therophyte lifeform were particularly sensitive to ozone. Species with higher mature leaf N concentration were more sensitive to ozone than those with lower leaf N concentration. Some relationships between relative sensitivity to ozone and Ellenberg habitat requirements were also identified. In contrast, no relationships between relative sensitivity to ozone and mature leaf P concentration, Grime's CSR strategy, leaf longevity, flowering season, stomatal density and maximum altitude were found. The relative sensitivity of species and relationships with plant characteristics identified in this study could be used to predict sensitivity to ozone of untested species and communities.

As soon as they are emitted to the atmosphere, however, hydrocarbons are destroyed by chemical reactions involving pollutants such as ozone. It is therefore likely that increased air pollution interferes with pollinator attracting hydrocarbon signals. To test this hypothesis, a Lagrangian diffusion model was used to determine the position of air parcels away from hydrocarbon sources and to estimate the rate of chemical destruction of hydrocarbons as air parcels moved across the landscape. The hydrocarbon compounds linalool, beta-myrcene, and beta-ocimene were chosen because they are known to be common scents released from flowers. The suppressed ambient abundances of volatile organic compounds were determined in response to increased regional levels of ozone, hydroxyl, and nitrate radicals. The results indicate that the documented increases in air pollution concentrations, from pre-industrial to present times, can lead to reductions in volatile compound concentrations insects detect as they pollinate flowers. For highly reactive volatiles the maximum downwind distance from the source at which pollinators can detect the scents may have changed from kilometers during pre-industrial times to < 200 m during the more polluted conditions of present times. The increased destruction of floral signals in polluted air masses may have important implications for both pollinators and signaling plants. When patches of flowers are further apart than the visual range of pollinators, such as in fragmented landscapes, the loss of scent signals may mean that pollinators spend more time searching for patches and less time foraging. This decrease in pollinator foraging efficiency will simultaneously decrease the pollinator's reproductive output and the amount of pollen flow in flowering plants.

In this study, we have used two tritrophic systems (Brassica oleracea-Plutella xylostella-Cotesia plutellae and Phaseolus lunatus-Tetranychus urticae-Phytoseiulus persimilis) to show that exposure of plants to moderately enhanced atmospheric O-3 levels (60 and 120 nl l(-1)) results in complete degradation of most herbivore-induced terpenes and GLVs, which is congruent with our hypothesis. However, orientation behavior of natural enemies was not disrupted by O-3 exposure in either tritrophic system.

Yield loss of the crops under current and future [O-3] was expressed relative to the yield under base [O-3] (<= 26 ppb). With potato, current [O-3] (31-50 ppb) reduced the yield by 5.3%, and it reduced the yield of barley, wheat and rice by 8.9%. 9.7% and 17.5%, respectively. In bean and soybean, the yield losses were 19.0% and 7.7%, respectively. Compared with yield loss at current [O-3], future [O-3] (51-75 ppb) drove a further 10% loss in yield of soybean, wheat and rice, and 20% loss in bean. Mass of individual grain, seed, or tuber was often the major cause of the yield loss at current and future [O-3], whereas other yield components also contributed to the yield loss in some cases. No significant difference was found between the responses in crops grown in pots and those in the ground for any yield parameters. The ameliorating effect of elevated [CO2] was significant in the yields of wheat and potato. and the individual grain weight in wheat exposed to future [O-3].

Besides regulating the relationship between plants and their ecosystems, phytochemicals are involved both in resistance against pathogens and in tolerance towards abiotic stresses, such as atmospheric pollution. Plant defence metabolites arise from the main secondary metabolic routes, the phenylpropanoid, the isoprenoid and the alkaloid pathways. In plants, antibiotic compounds can be both preformed (phytoanticipins) and inducible ( phytoalexins), the former including saponins, cyanogenic glycosides and glucosinolates. Chronic exposure to tropospheric ozone (O-3) stimulates the carbon fluxes from the primary to the secondary metabolic pathways to a great extent, inducing a shift of the available resources in favour of the synthesis of secondary products. In some cases, the plant defence responses against pathogens and environmental pollutants may overlap, leading to the unspecific synthesis of similar molecules, such as phenylpropanoids. Exposure to ozone can also modify the pattern of biogenic volatile organic compounds (BVOC), emitted from plant in response to herbivore feeding, thus altering the tritrophic interaction among plant, phytophagy and their natural enemies. Finally, the synthesis of ethylene and polyamines can be regulated by ozone at level of S-adenosylmethionine (SAM), the biosynthetic precursor of both classes of hormones, which can, therefore, mutually inhibit their own biosynthesis with consequence on plant phenotype.",9.4.9.3,Indirect Effects on Wildlife,8.7.2,Pollinator Attraction and Plant Host Detection

Total ozone flux varied diurnally with maximum values reaching 100 mu mol m(-2) h(-1) at midday and minimums at or near zero at night. Mean daytime canopy conductance was 0.5 mol m(-2) s(-1). During daytime, non-stomatal ozone conductance accounted for as much as 66% of canopy conductance, with the non-stomatal sink representing 63% of the ozone flux. Stomatal conductance showed expected patterns of behaviour with respect to photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD) and vapour pressure defecit (VPD). Non-stomatal conductance for ozone increased monotonically with increasing PPFD, increased with temperature (T) before falling off again at high T, and behaved similarly for VPD.

The study is based on modelled global hourly ozone fields for the year 2000 and 2030, using the global 1??1? 2-way nested atmospheric chemical transport model (TM5). Projections for the year 2030 are based on the relatively optimistic ?current legislation (CLE) scenario?, i.e. assuming that currently approved air quality legislation will be fully implemented by the year 2030, without a further development of new abatement policies. For both runs, the relative yield loss due to ozone damage is evaluated based on two different indices (accumulated concentration above a 40 ppbV threshold and seasonal mean daytime ozone concentration respectively) on a global, regional and national scale. The cumulative metric appears to be far less robust than the seasonal mean, while the seasonal mean shows satisfactory agreement with measurements in Europe, the US, China and Southern India and South-East Asia.

Present day global relative yield losses are estimated to range between 7% and 12% for wheat, between 6% and 16% for soybean, between 3% and 4% for rice, and between 3% and 5% for maize (range resulting from different metrics used). Taking into account possible biases in our assessment, introduced through the global application of ?western? crop exposure?response functions, and through model performance in reproducing ozone-exposure metrics, our estimates may be considered as being conservative.

Under the 2030 CLE scenario, the global situation is expected to deteriorate mainly for wheat (additional 2?6% loss globally) and rice (additional 1?2% loss globally). India, for which no mitigation measures have been assumed by 2030, accounts for 50% of these global increase in crop yield loss. On a regional-scale, significant reductions in crop losses by CLE-2030 are only predicted in Europe (soybean) and China (wheat).

Translating these assumed yield losses into total global economic damage for the four crops considered, using world market prices for the year 2000, we estimate an economic loss in the range $14?$26 billion. About 40% of this damage is occurring in China and India. Considering the recent upward trends in food prices, the ozone-induced damage to crops is expected to offset a significant portion of the GDP growth rate, especially in countries with an economy based on agricultural production.",9.4.4,Crop Yield and Quality in Agricultural Systems,8.5.2,Yield Loss at Regional and National Scales

No effects of ozone on DOC concentrations or characteristics were recorded for the bog cores. The data suggest higher ozone sensitivity of plants growing in the fen-type peatland, that the impacts on the vegetation may affect soil carbon characteristics through a reduction in root exudates and that there may have been a shift in the source of substrate DOC for microbial consumption from vegetation exudates to native soil carbon.

However, the impact of these fairly uncertain physical effects is substantially less than the difference between alternative emission scenarios for all short- lived species. The net global mean annual average direct radiative forcing from the short-lived species is.02 W/m(2) or less in our projections, as substantial positive ozone forcing is largely offset by negative aerosol direct forcing.

Light and vapor pressure deficit (VPD) were the most dominant environmental drivers controlling the deposition of O3 at this site through their influence on stomatal conductance. 81% of the daytime O3 uptake was predicted to occur through the stomata. Stomatal uptake decreased at high VPD and temperatures leading to an overall decrease in O3 flux; however, we did observe a non-stomatal conductance for O3 that increased slightly with temperature before leveling off at higher values. During the growing season, O3 deposition fluxes were enhanced after midday precipitation events and continued at elevated levels throughout the following night, implying a role for surface wetness. From nighttime data, evidence for both the presence of water films on the needles and non-closure of the plant stomata were observed.

The study was conducted during two growing seasons, when steady-state leaf area index (L) had been reached after > 6 years of exposure to CO2- and O-3-enrichment treatments. Canopy conductance (g(c)) was estimated from stand sap flux, while leaf-level conductance of sun leaves in the upper canopy was derived by three different and independent methods: sap flux and L in combination with vertical canopy modelling, leaf C-13 discrimination methodology in combination with photosynthesis modelling and leaf-level gas exchange. Regardless of the method used, the mean values of leaf-level conductance were higher in trees growing under elevated CO2 and/or O-3 than in trees growing in control plots, causing a CO2 x O-3 interaction that was statistically significant (P <= 0.10) for sap flux-and (for birch) C-13-derived leaf conductance.

Implementation of the evaluation protocol took place during a 25-day period (August 5-29), utilizing hourly O3 concentration data obtained from over 450 monitors from the U.S. Environment Protection Agency's Air Quality System network.",0,0,2.8,Evidence Inventories?????Data Tables to Provide Supporting Information

We addressed the impact of doubling background O-3 on the host location of the parasitoid Cotesia plutellae by conducting 24-h trials in an open-air O-3-fumigation system during two consecutive years. Two circles (radii 1.40 and 4.00 m) of Plutella xylostella-infested potted cabbage plants were placed in the O-3 and ambient plots. Female wasps were released into each plot from the center, and observed 5 times over a 24-h period to assess their host location capability. Thereafter, plants were kept in laboratory conditions until larvae pupation to determine parasitism rates. No significant differences were detected between ambient and O-3-enriched environments either in the number of wasps found in the field, or in the percentages of parasitized larvae. This suggests that moderately elevated O-3 will not affect the behavior of this parasitoid. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Nitryl chloride is potentially important to atmospheric chemistry in urban environments because its photolysis products include both NO2 and chlorine atoms. Chlorine atoms have previously been shown to significantly increase ozone formation in urban Houston. Photochemical modeling was performed using the Comprehensive Air quality Model with extensions (CAMx) to estimate the effects of observed nitryl chloride concentrations on local chemistry in southeast Texas. CAMx was modified to include a formation mechanism for nitryl chloride as well as its photolysis reaction. Comparisons between model predictions and ambient measurements showed that the model-predicted ClNO2 concentrations were within the range of observed data. Model simulations predict that ClNO2 increases total reactive chlorine mass by 20-40% in the atmosphere of southeast Texas. Despite the high reactivity of chlorine, nitryl chloride caused only modest increases in ozone concentrations ( up to 1.0-1.5 ppb when baseline 1-h average ozone concentrations were between 60 and 85 ppb). The chemistry and physical processes which affect ozone formation were further investigated using box model simulations and a Lagrangian process analysis tool (LPA) within the gridded photochemical modeling simulations.

Since the response to perturbations is non-linear due to chemistry, conclusions drawn from different studies may depend on the magnitude of the applied perturbation. We investigate this issue for intercontinental transport between North America, Europe, and Asia with sensitivity simulations in three global chemical transport models. In each region, we decrease anthropogenic emissions of NOx and nonmethane volatile organic compounds (NMVOCs) by 20% and 100%. We find strong nonlinearity in the response to NOx perturbations outside summer, reflecting transitions in the chemical regime for ozone production. In contrast, we find no significant nonlinearity to NOx perturbations in summer or to NMVOC perturbations year-round. The relative benefit of decreasing NOx vs. NMVOC from current levels to abate intercontinental pollution increases with the magnitude of emission reductions. Citation: Wu, S., B. N. Duncan, D. J.

Classic injury symptoms on well-known bioindicator plants strongly supported the presumption that symptoms were caused by photochemical oxidants, of which ozone (O3) is the primary pollutant. Symptoms in indicator plants characteristic of injury caused by peroxyacetyl nitrate (PAN), ethylene, and sulfur dioxide (SO2) were also reported (de Bauer 1972; de Bauer and Hernandez-Tejeda 1986). These discoveries were followed in 1976 by the observation of O3 injury symptoms in native pine species in forests in Ajusco (AJ), just south of Mexico City (de Bauer and Hernandez-Tejeda 1986; Krupa and de Bauer 1976). Then in the 1980s, a dramatic and severe decline occurred in sacred fir (Abies religiosa) stands in the highly polluted area of the Desierto de los Leones (DL) National Park southwest of Mexico City (Alvarado-Rosales and Hernandez-Tejeda 2002). Thousands of trees died, leaving dead zones called cemeteries. Air pollution was widely believed to be an important causal factor in the widespread mortality of sacred fir within the park (Ciesla and Macias-Samano 1987). Topographic conditions, including volcanic mountain ranges circumscribing much of the Basin, thermal atmospheric inversions, and prevailing winds which carry pollutants from the urban zone to forested areas to the south-southwest (SSW), create conditions favoring high pollution exposure for these forests (Bravo and Torres 2002; Jauregui 2002).",9.4.7.1,Forest,8.2,Visible Foliar Injury and Biomonitoring

Concentrations of sulfate, nitrate, primary organic carbon (POA), secondary organic carbon (SOA), black carbon (BC) aerosols, and tropospheric O3 for the years 1950 and 2000 are obtained a priori by coupled chemistry-aerosol-GCM simulations, and then monthly concentrations are interpolated linearly between 1951 and 2000. The annual concentrations of GHGs are taken from the IPCC Third Assessment Report. BC aerosol is internally mixed with other aerosols. Model results indicate that the simulated climate change over 1951?2000 is sensitive to anthropogenic changes in atmospheric components. The predicted year 2000 global mean surface air temperature can differ by 0.8?C with different forcings. Relative to the climate simulation without changes in GHGs, O3, and aerosols, anthropogenic forcings of SO42?, BC, BC+SO42?, BC+SO42?+POA, BC+SO42?+POA+SOA+NO3?, O3, and GHGs are predicted to change the surface air temperature averaged over 1971?2000 in eastern China, respectively, by ?0.40?C, +0.62?C, +0.18?C, +0.15?C, ?0.78?C, +0.43?C, and +0.85?C, and to change the precipitation, respectively, by ?0.21, +0.07, ?0.03, +0.02, ?0.24, ?0.08, and +0.10 mm d?1.

When only changes in chemistry are considered (constant climate) the modeled global-mean tropospheric ozone column increase since preindustrial times ranges from 7.9DU to 13.8DU among the ten participating models, while the stratospheric column reduction lies between 14.1DU and 28.6DU in the models considering stratospheric chemistry.

location and altitude of the modeled ozone change and varies between 0.25Wm?2 and 0.45Wm?2 due to ozone change in the troposphere and ?0.123Wm?2 and +0.066Wm?2 due to the stratospheric ozone change.
Changes in ozone and other greenhouse gases since preindustrial
times have altered climate. Six out of the ten participating models have performed an additional calculation taking into account both chemical and climate change. In most models the isolated effect of climate change is an enhancement of the tropospheric ozone column increase, while the  stratospheric reduction becomes slightly less severe. In the

Through year 2030, simulated climate is only weakly dependent on the projected levels of short-lived air pollutants, primarily the result of a near cancellation of their global net radiative forcing. However, by year 2100, the projected decrease in sulfate aerosol (driven by a 65% reduction in global sulfur dioxide emissions) and the projected increase in black carbon aerosol (driven by a 100% increase in its global emissions) contribute a significant portion of the simulated A1B surface air warming relative to the year 2000: 0.2?C (Southern Hemisphere), 0.4?C globally, 0.6?C (Northern Hemisphere), 1.5?3?C (wintertime Arctic), and 1.5?2?C (~40% of the total) in the summertime United States. These projected changes are also responsible for a significant decrease in central United States late summer root zone soil water and precipitation. By year 2100, changes in short-lived air pollutants produce a global average increase in radiative forcing of ~1 W/m2; over east Asia it exceeds 5 W/m2. However, the resulting regional patterns of surface temperature warming do not follow the regional patterns of changes in short-lived species emissions, tropospheric loadings, or radiative forcing (global pattern correlation coefficient of ?0.172). Rather, the regional patterns of warming from short-lived species are similar to the patterns for well-mixed greenhouse gases (global pattern correlation coefficient of 0.8) with the strongest warming occurring over the summer continental United States, Mediterranean Sea, and southern Europe and over the winter Arctic.",1.3.3.4,Feedback Factors that Alter the Climate Response to Changes in O3 Radiative Forcing,9.3.1,Recent Evidence for Effects on Temperature

The relative importance of these effects is not clear, particularly because neither the response to regional forcings nor the regional forcings themselves are well known for the twentieth century. Here we investigate the sensitivity of regional climate to changes in carbon dioxide, black carbon aerosols, sulphate aerosols and ozone in the tropics, mid-latitudes and polar regions, using a coupled ocean-atmosphere model. We find that mid- and high-latitude climate is quite sensitive to the location of the forcing. Using these relationships between forcing and response along with observations of twentieth century climate change, we reconstruct radiative forcing from aerosols in space and time. Our reconstructions broadly agree with historical emissions estimates, and can explain the differences between observed changes in Arctic temperatures and expectations from non-aerosol forcings plus unforced variability. We conclude that decreasing concentrations of sulphate aerosols and increasing concentrations of black carbon have substantially contributed to rapid Arctic warming during the past three decades.",1.3.3.4,Feedback Factors that Alter the Climate Response to Changes in O3 Radiative Forcing,9.3.1,Recent Evidence for Effects on Temperature

Using the spatial and temporal distribution of precursor emissions, we simulated tropospheric ozone from 1890 to 1990 using the NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies (GISS) chemistry model. Archived three-dimensional ozone fields were then used in transient GISS climate model simulations. This enables more realistic evaluation of the impact of tropospheric ozone increases than prior simulations using an interpolation between preindustrial and present-day ozone. We find that tropospheric ozone contributed to the greater 20th-century warming in the Northern Hemisphere extratropics compared with the tropics and in the tropics compared with the Southern Hemisphere extratropics. Additionally, ozone increased more rapidly during the latter half of the century than the former, causing more rapid warming during that time. This is especially apparent in the tropics and is consistent with observations, which do not show similar behavior in the extratropics. Other climate forcings do not substantially accelerate warming rates in the tropics relative to other regions. This suggests that accelerated tropospheric ozone increases related to industrialization in the developing world have contributed to the accelerated tropical warming. During boreal summer, tropospheric ozone causes enhanced warming (>0.5?C) over polluted northern continental regions. Finally, the Arctic climate response to tropospheric ozone increases is large during fall, winter, and spring when ozone's lifetime is comparatively long and pollution transported from midlatitudes is abundant. The model indicates that tropospheric ozone could have contributed about 0.3?C annual average and about 0.4?C?0.5?C during winter and spring to the 20th-century Arctic warming. Pollution controls could thus substantially reduce the rapid rate of Arctic warming. ",1.3.3.2,The Effect of Surface Albedo on O3 Radiative Forcing,9.1.1,Summary from the 213 Ozone ISA

It is impossible using standard epidemiological designs to uniquely identify any individual component of air pollution as a causal agent of a health effect because of simultaneous exposure to all or a subset of ambient pollutants. Nevertheless, associations observed for a particular pollutant can be interpreted as a marker of toxicity of the mixture, and regulatory action on judiciously selected pollutants can benefit health, as such actions can modify the complex mixture. This paper argues that we may be able to further our understanding of the effects of air pollution on human health by investigating whether particular mixtures are more toxic through (1) conducting and reporting results for all measured components; (2) possibly characterizing the complex mixture by developing synoptic categorizations of daily air pollution, through cluster or latent profile analysis; (3) a careful analysis of differences in the mixtures between locations; and (4) toxicological studies and controlled studies on humans that make use of factorial designs for various components of the air pollution mixture.",0,0,2.5,Copollutant Correlations and Potential for Confounding

Nonetheless, elevated CO2 decreased beetle performance on one aspen genotype and had inconsistent effects on beetles reared on two other genotypes. Elevated O3 decreased beetle performance, especially for beetles reared on an O3-sensitive genotype. Regression analyses indicated that phenolic glycosides and nitrogen explain a substantial amount (27?45%) of the variation in herbivore performance. By contrast to the negative effects that are typically observed with generalist herbivores, aspen leaf beetles appear to benefit from phenolic glycosides, chemical components that are largely genetically-determined in aspen.

There were three treatments within open-top chambers: charcoal-filtered air (CF as a check treatment), CF plus 100 nL O-3 L-1 (O-3-1), and CF plus 150 nL O-3 L-1 (O-3-2). Soil samples were collected in August, September, and October to assess microbial biomass C, community-level physiological profiles (CLPPs), and phospholipid fatty acids (PLFAs) of soil microbes. The results showed that soil microbial biomass under elevated O-3 concentration was statistically significantly decreased compared with the check treatment in October. Soil microbial functional indices including average well color development, richness, and Shannon diversity were significantly decreased by elevated O-3 in September. Principal components analysis of CLPP data showed that elevated O-3 significantly changed the C sources utilization pattern of microbes in September (Principle Component 1,P < 0.05). During all growing stages, elevated O-3 had significant effects on soil microbial composition expressed as PLFA percentage, which indicated that PLFA was more sensitive than CLPP for study of the microbial community. The stress indicators, including the ratio of saturated to unsaturated fatty acids and the ratio of cyclopropyl fatty acids to their precursors, such as cy17:0 to 16:1 omega 7c, also increased under elevated O-3 exposure.",9.4.7.3,Microbes,8.1.2,Microbes

Our objective was to determine how a plant community responds over several generations to elevated ozone exposures. Seed bank soil collected from the Oregon State University Farm, containing a population of naturalized plants common to the Willamette Valley, was uniformly dispersed across the surface of nine modified open top chambers. Each chamber was randomly assigned one of three ozone treatments (0, 90 and 120 ppb episodic ozone). Sixty plant species from 22 families emerged in the chambers over the four year study. Seedling emergence was a highly sensitive period. High seedling mortality rates in the ozone treatments allowed more resistant individuals to persist. Communities not exposed to elevated ozone levels also had high rates of mortality probably due to density dependant mortality. No species were eliminated from the communities because of ozone. Plant species did not demonstrate ozone tolerance or susceptibility based on taxonomic relationships. Year-to-year environmental heterogeneity was a stronger influence on community composition than ozone exposures. At the community level, there was a trend of decreasing biomass with increasing ozone exposure. In the ozone treatments, premature senescence of taller species increased light availability to understory species, changing competitive interactions and altering community dynamics in the understory. The effects of ozone on individual species, both direct and indirect, in a community may be detrimental, insignificant, or positive. Predication of a species performance in a community will be difficult due to the many environmental and biological interactions occurring simultaneously or at alternative times during a specific species life cycle. Studies are necessary to decrease the uncertainty in attempting to assess the impact of ozone on both managed and natural ecosystems currently determined from extrapolating the effects on individuals. Currently, plant communities remain protected at an unknown level from ozone exposure. Published by Elsevier B.V.",9.4.7.2,Grassland and Agricultural Land,8.1.1.2,Grassland and Agricultural Land

The aim of this study was to assess, whether exhaled breath profile analysis can detect the inflammatory airway response induced by ozone inhalation. METHODS: In a randomized double-blind, cross-over study 14 healthy ozone-responsive subjects were exposed to 250ppb ozone and filtered room air for 3h with intermittent exercise. Blood biomarkers, exhaled NO, exhaled CO, and breathprints (Cyranose 320(?)) were assessed prior and at 3 time points up to 24h post exposure. Induced sputum was collected at baseline and 3h post exposure. Multivariate analysis of eNose data was performed using transformed and normalized datasets. RESULTS: Significantly increased numbers of sputum and blood neutrophils were observed after ozone, whereas the eNose signals showed no differences between exposures and no correlation with neutrophilic airway inflammation. However, independent of ozone exposure, sensor data correlated with serum SP-D levels and to a smaller extent with blood neutrophil numbers. CONCLUSIONS: Exhaled breath profiles as measured by the Cyranose 320(?) did not reflect airway responses to ozone. This suggests that exhaled volatiles did not change with ozone challenges or that the changes were below the detection limits. Conversely, the correlation of eNose signals with blood neutrophils and serum SP-D, i.e. markers of systemic inflammation and lung permeability, suggested that the Cyranose 320(?) can detect volatile organic compounds of systemic origin.",0,0,3.1.4.1.1,Controlled Human Exposure Studies

Contributions from eight different local NO source types and eight different source regions to the 8-h average daytime O(3) concentrations from 1100 to 1800 CST (referred to as AD O(3) hereafter) are determined. Both diesel engines and highway gasoline vehicles account for 25 ppb of AD O(3) in the urban Houston area. NO(x) from natural gas combustion produces 35 ppb of AD O(3) in the industrial area of Houston. Contributions from industrial sources and coal combustion to AD O(3) have comparatively less broad spatial distribution with maximum values of 14 ppb and 20 ppb, respectively. Although the local sources are the most important sources, upwind sources have non-negligible influences (20-50%) on AD O(3) in the entire domain, with a maximum of 50 ppb in rural and coastal areas and 20 ppb in urban and industrial areas. To probe the origins of upwind sources contributions, NO(x) emissions in the entire eastern United States are divided into eight different regions and their contributions to O(3) concentrations in the Houston-Galveston-Brazoria (HGB) and Beaumont-Port Arthur (BPA) areas are determined. Among the various NO(x) source regions resolved in this study, other Texas counties near the HGB and BPA areas and southeastern states are the most important non-local sources of O(3). Under favorable transport conditions, emissions from neighbor states and northeastern states could also contribute to non-negligible O(3) concentrations (7-15%) in the HGB and BPA areas. This indicates that in addition to reduce local emissions, regional NO(x) emission controls, especially from the neighbor counties and states, are also necessary to improve O(3) air quality in Southeast Texas.

Aircraft measurements suggest these released VOCs create plumes with ozone (O3) production rates 2-5 times higher than typical urban conditions. Modeling studies found that simulating high O3 productions requires superfine (1-km) horizontal grid cell size. Compared with fine modeling (4-kmin), the superfine resolution increases the peak O3 concentration by as much as 46%. To understand this drastic O3 change, this study quantifies model processes for O3 and &quot;odd oxygen&quot; (Ox) in both resolutions. For the entire plume, the superfine resolution increases the maximum O3 concentration 3% but only decreases the maximum Ox concentration 0.2%. The two grid sizes produce approximately equal Ox mass but by different reaction pathways. Derived sensitivity to oxides of nitrogen (NOx) and VOC emissions suggests resolution-specific sensitivity to NOx and VOC emissions. Different sensitivity to emissions will result in different O3 responses to subsequently encountered emissions (within the city or downwind). Sensitivity of O3 to emission changes also results in different simulated O3 responses to the same control strategies. Sensitivity of O3 to NOx and VOC emission changes is attributed to finer resolved Eulerian grid and finer resolved NOx emissions. Urban NOx concentration gradients are often caused by roadway mobile sources that would not typically be addressed with Plume-in-Grid models. This study shows that grid cell size (an artifact of modeling) influences simulated control strategies and could bias regulatory decisions. Understanding the dynamics of VOC plume dependence on grid size is the first step toward providing more detailed guidance for resolution. These results underscore VOC and NOx resolution interdependencies best addressed by finer resolution. On the basis of these results, the authors suggest a need for quantitative metrics for horizontal grid resolution in future model guidance.",0,0,2.3.2.3,Chemical Transport Modeling

Annual and ozone season (OS) NO(x) emissions from electric generating units (EGUs) have declined 48% and 66%, respectively, in the EUS. From 1997-1999 to 2006-2008 measured decline in meteorologically adjusted (met-adj) daily maximum 8-h (dm8h) O(3), has been 8 b or 14% for the EUS during the May-September OS, with the largest declines occurring in the highest concentration category (99th percentile). Random coefficient models, with NBP and Acid Rain Program (ARP) regulated NO(x) emissions as the independent variable, show highly significant relations (p <= 0.0001) to dm8h O(3) for 1997-2008 during the OS. Regional declines within the EUS range from 11% to 16%. The patterns of the O(3) trends are in general agreement with other recent studies. Rural and urban sites both show similar levels of decline from pre- to post-NBP periods. Dry-NO(3) during the OS shows a substantial decline from 3.1 to 1.8 mu g NO(3) m(-3). Random coefficient models show regional results ranging from 32% to 39% declines, and measured results show a 35-46% decline in dry-NO(3) from 1997-1999 to 2006-2008. These results suggest that regulating NO(x) emissions has been highly effective in reducing both ozone and dry-NO(3) concentrations during the OS. Overall, a 32% reduction in total annual anthropogenic NO(x) emissions from 1997 to 2005 has been accompanied by a 7-8 ppb, or 12-13% decline in OS dm8h O(3) concentration, and a 34% decline in dry-NO(3) concentration in the 20-state NBP region.

We evaluate the performance of a 12 km resolution CMAQ simulation with surface and aircraft observations of CO, O(3), and NO(x) during the summer of 2002. When all data are considered, on average, modeled and observed CO total column contents (surface to 3,000 m) agreed to within 14% in the morning and 22% in the afternoon. Reducing the deposition velocity for CO improves model-measurement agreement but did not eliminate the model bias. The majority of observed vertical profiles have a maximum near the surface. Although many observed spirals had a secondary maximum at the top of the boundary layer, indicating subgrid-scale shallow convection. The model was not able to replicate these vertical structures. Water vapor profiles likewise showed greater vertical variability in the observations than in the model. General conclusions from these model-measurement comparisons: total CO emissions estimates are either adequate or underestimated, but there is no evidence of gross error; NO(x) emissions from mobile sources may be overestimated while the lifetime of NO(x) may be underestimated in CMAQ 4.5.1 with CBIV, and vertical mixing in the model boundary layer may be too fast, but venting out of the boundary layer into the lower free troposphere may be too slow.",0,0,2.8,Evidence Inventories?????Data Tables to Provide Supporting Information

Specifically, the Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) model is evaluated for its ability to simulate the change in ozone (O(3)) levels in response to significant reductions in nitric oxide (NO(x) = NO + NO(2)) emissions from the NO(x) State Implementation Plan (SIP) Call and vehicle fleet turnover between the years of 2002 and 2005. The dynamic model evaluation (i.e., the evaluation of a model's ability to predict changes in pollutant levels given changes in emissions) differs from previous approaches by explicitly accounting for known uncertainties in the NO(x) emissions inventories. Uncertainty in three sectors of NO(x) emissions is considered - area sources, mobile sources, and point sources - and is propagated using sensitivity coefficients calculated by the decoupled direct method in three dimensions (DDM-3D). The change in O(3) levels between 2002 and 2005 is estimated based on differences in the empirical distributions of the modeled and observed data during the two years. Results indicate that the CMAQ model is able to reproduce the observed change in daily maximum 8-hr average O(3) levels at more than two-thirds of Air Quality System (AQS) monitoring locations when a relatively moderate amount of uncertainty (50%) is assumed in area and mobile emissions of NO(x) together with a low amount of uncertainty (3%) in the utility sector (elevated point sources) emissions.

The high-order decoupled direct method (HDDM) was implemented into ACM2, and was extended to quantify the influence of parametric uncertainties in dry deposition velocity and eddy diffusivity in both vertical diffusion schemes in CMAQ. Choices of vertical diffusion scheme and parameter values did not strongly influence model performance in simulating ozone concentrations or predicted ozone-precursor responsiveness over much of the domain. However, in some high ozone locations, results show the 8-h ozone sensitivity to NOx may vary by approximately 20% due to the choice of vertical mixing scheme and by 5-10% due to the uncertainty in dry deposition velocities.

These emission coefficients reproduce ratios of emissions with fuel type reported previously using independent methods. However, the magnitude of these coefficients is lower than prior estimates. While it is possible that a negative bias in the OMI NO2 retrieval over regions of active fire emissions is partly responsible, comparison with several other studies of fire emissions using satellite platforms indicates that current emission factors may overestimate the contributions of flaming combustion and underestimate the contributions of smoldering combustion to total fire emissions.

This method is applied to two simplified chemistry schemes, which represent the main characteristics of atmospheric ozone chemistry. Analytical solutions are presented for this tagging approach. In the past, besides tagging approaches, sensitivity methods were used, which estimate the contributions from individual sources based on differences in two simulations, a base case and a simulation with a perturbation in the respective emission category. We apply both methods to our simplified chemical systems and demonstrate that potentially large errors (factor of 2) occur with the sensitivity method, which depend on the degree of linearity of the chemical system. This error depends on two factors, the ability to linearise the chemical system around a base case, and second the completeness of the contributions, which means that all contributions should principally add up to 100%. For some chemical regimes the first error can be minimised by employing only small perturbations of the respective emission, e.g. 5%. The second factor depends on the chemical regime and cannot be minimized by a specific experimental set-up. It is inherent to the sensitivity method.

Ten years of particulate carbon and speciated non-methane organic compound (NMOC) data combined with other measurements from Southeastern Aerosol Research and Characterization (SEARCH) and other sites provide insight into the association between elemental carbon (EC), OC and NMOCs. Data are analyzed to characterize the OC and SOC contrasts between urban Atlanta, Georgia, and nearby non-urban conditions in the Southeast. Analysis of the monitoring record indicates that the mean Atlanta urban excess of total carbon (TC) is 2.1-2.8 mu g m(-3). The OC/EC ratio of the Atlanta urban excess is in the range 1.3 to 1.8, consistent with OC/EC ratios observed in motor vehicle emissions and a fossil carbon source of urban excess TC. Carbon isotope analysis of a subset of particle samples demonstrates that the urban excess is mainly fossil in origin, even though the majority of the TC is modern at both urban and non-urban sites. Temperature-dependent partitioning of OC between gas and condensed phases cannot explain the observed diurnal and seasonal variations of OC/CO, EC/CO, and OC/EC ratios. Alternatively, a hypothesis involving vertical mixing of OC-enriched air from aloft is supported by the seasonal and diurnal OC, isopentane, aromatic and isoprene observations at the ground. A statistical model is applied to indicate the relative significance of aerometric factors affecting OC and EC concentrations, including meteorological and pollutant associations. The model results demonstrate strong linkages between fine particle carbon and pollutant indicators of source emissions compared with meteorological factors: the model results show weaker dependence of OC on meteorological factors than is the case for ozone (O(3)) concentrations.

general, the predicted 03 concentrations by S07 are lower than those of S99 with maximum  
difference as high as 20%. The two mechanisms also show significant differences in the predicted  
OH, HNO3, PAN and HCHO concentrations. S99 predicts higher OH concentration by 7-20%, higher PAN  
by approximately 20-25% and higher HCHO by approximately 15% than S07. OH budget analysis  
suggests that OH propagation factor (P-OH) is higher in urban and industrial areas but lower in  
rural areas. Although S07 generally predicts similar or higher P-OH, S99 predicts higher new OH  
formation rate from H2O + O(D-1) and leads to higher OH and thus higher O-3 in most part of the  
domain. OH reactions with VOCs and CO accounts for a majority part of reacted OH. Secondary VOCs  
photolysis is not a main path of regenerated OH. New OH mainly comes from H2O + O(D-1) reaction.

We analyzed all of these attributes and others to determine if statistically significant differences exist among them to warrant their being used to define distinct cohort groups. We focused our attention mostly on the relationship between cohort attributes and the time spent outdoors, indoors, and in motor vehicles. Our results indicate that besides age and gender, other important attributes for defining cohorts are the physical activity level of individuals, weather factors such as daily maximum temperature in combination with months of the year, and combined weekday/weekend with employment status. Less important are precipitation and ethnic data. While statistically significant, the collective set of attributes does not explain a large amount of variance in outdoor, indoor, or in-vehicle locational decisions. Based on other research, parameters such as lifestyle and life stages that are absent from CHAD might have reduced the amount of unexplained variance.

The 3D CMAQ MCM model successfully reproduced the observed ozone concentrations throughout the Southeast Texas region, with model performance similar to that of the standard SAPRC07 mechanism. The CMAQ MCM has been used to evaluate the VOC emission inventory by directly simulating the concentrations of a large number of VOCs.

One cut-out was centered over North America and the other over Europe, covering sufficient spatial domain for each modeling group to extract the necessary time- and space-varying (horizontal and vertical) concentrations for their mesoscale model boundaries. Examples of the impact of these boundary concentrations on the AQMEII continental simulations are presented to quantify the sensitivity of the simulations to boundary concentrations. In addition, some participating groups were not able to use the GEMS data and instead relied upon other sources for their boundary concentration specifications. These are noted, and the contrasting impacts of other data sources for boundary data are presented. How one specifies four-dimensional boundary concentrations for mesoscale air quality simulations can have a profound impact on the model results, and hence, this aspect of data preparation must be performed with considerable care.

In this study, distributions of daily ambient concentrations were modeled over space and time for 12 air pollutants. Simulated pollutant fields were produced for a 6-year time period over the 20-county metropolitan Atlanta area using the Stanford Geostatistical Modeling Software (SGeMS). These simulations incorporate the temporal and spatial autocorrelation structure of ambient pollutants, as well as season and day-of-week temporal and spatial trends; these fields were considered to be the true ambient pollutant fields for the purposes of the simulations that followed. Simulated monitor data at the locations of actual monitors were then generated that contain error representative of instrument imprecision. From the simulated monitor data, four exposure metrics were calculated: central monitor and unweighted, population-weighted, and area-weighted averages. For each metric, the amount and type of error relative to the simulated pollutant fields are characterized and the impact of error on an epidemiologic time-series analysis is predicted. The amount of error, as indicated by a lack of spatial autocorrelation, is greater for primary pollutants than for secondary pollutants and is only moderately reduced by averaging across monitors; more error will result in less statistical power in the epidemiologic analysis. The type of error, as indicated by the correlations of error with the monitor data and with the true ambient concentration, varies with exposure metric, with error in the central monitor metric more of the classical type (i.e., independent of the monitor data) and error in the spatial average metrics more of the Berkson type (i.e., independent of the true ambient concentration).

Ozone (O3) is one of six principal (or criteria) pollutants for which EPA has established national ambient air quality standards (NAAQS). The Clean Air Act requires EPA to periodically review the scientific basis for these standards by preparing an Integrated Science Assessment (ISA).

As part of the current review of the ozone National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS), the US EPA evaluated the health exposure and risks associated with ambient ozone pollution using a statistical approach to adjust recent air quality to simulate just meeting the current standard level, without specifying emission control strategies. One drawback of this purely statistical concentration rollback approach is that it does not take into account spatial and temporal heterogeneity of ozone response to emissions changes. The application of the higher-order decoupled direct method (HDDM) in the community multiscale air quality (CMAQ) model is discussed here to provide an example of a methodology that could incorporate this variability into the risk assessment analyses. Because this approach includes a full representation of the chemical production and physical transport of ozone in the atmosphere, it does not require assumed background concentrations, which have been applied to constrain estimates from past statistical techniques. The CMAQ-HDDM adjustment approach is extended to measured ozone concentrations by determining typical sensitivities at each monitor location and hour of the day based on a linear relationship between first-order sensitivities and hourly ozone values. This approach is demonstrated by modeling ozone responses for monitor locations in Detroit and Charlotte to domain-wide reductions in anthropogenic NOx and VOCs emissions. As seen in previous studies, ozone response calculated using HDDM compared well to brute-force emissions changes up to approximately a 50% reduction in emissions. A new stepwise approach is developed here to apply this method to emissions reductions beyond 50% allowing for the simulation of more stringent reductions in ozone concentrations. Compared to previous rollback methods, this application of modeled sensitivities to ambient ozone concentrations provides a more realistic spatial response of ozone concentrations at monitors inside and outside the urban core and at hours of both high and low ozone concentrations.",0,0,2.8,Evidence Inventories?????Data Tables to Provide Supporting Information

The comprehensive nested modeling system comprises three models: Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ), Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF), and Sparse Matrix Operator Kernel Emissions (SMOKE). In addition, the decoupled direct method in three dimensions (DDM-3D) is used to determine the sensitivities of pollutant concentrations to changes in precursor emissions during a severe smog episode in July of 2006. The average simulated 8-hr daily maximum O3 concentration is 48.9 ppb, with 1-hr O3 maxima up to 106 ppb (40 km southeast of Seattle). The average simulated PM2.5 (particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter &lt; 2.5 microm) concentration at the measurement sites is 9.06 microg m(-3), which is in good agreement with the observed concentration (8.06 microg m(-3)). In urban areas (i.e., Seattle, Vancouver, etc.), the model predicts that, on average, a reduction of NO(x) emissions is simulated to lead to an increase in average 8-hr daily maximum O3 concentrations, and will be most prominent in Seattle (where the greatest sensitivity is -O.2 ppb per % change of mobile sources). On the other hand, decreasing NO(x) emissions is simulated to decrease the 8-hr maximum O3 concentrations in remote and forested areas. Decreased NO(x) emissions are simulated to slightly increase PM2.5 in major urban areas. In urban areas, a decrease in VOC emissions will result in a decrease of 8-hr maximum O3 concentrations. The impact of decreased VOC emissions from biogenic, mobile, nonroad, and area sources on average 8-hr daily maximum O3 concentrations is up to 0.05 ppb decrease per % of emission change, each. Decreased emissions of VOCs decrease average PM2.5 concentrations in the entire modeling domain. In major cities, PM2.5 concentrations are more sensitive to emissions of VOCs from biogenic sources than other sources of VOCs. These results can be used to interpret the effectiveness of VOC or NO(x) controls over pollutant concentrations, especially for localities that may exceed National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS). Implications: The effect of NO(x) and VOC controls on ozone and PM2.5 concentrations in the northwestern United States is examined using the decoupled direct method in three dimensions (DDM-3D) in a state-of-the-art three-dimensional chemical transport model (CMAQ). NO(x) controls are predicted to increase PM2.5 and ozone in major urban areas and decrease ozone in more remote and forested areas. VOC reductions are helpful in reducing ozone and PM2.5 concentrations in urban areas.

The results are linear in the troposphere, i.e., the sum of ozone from individual tagged sources equals the ozone from all sources to within 3% in zonal mean monthly averages. In addition, the tagged ozone is shown to equal the standard ozone, when all tropospheric sources are tagged and stratospheric input is turned off. The stratospheric ozone contribution to the troposphere determined from the difference between total ozone and ozone from all tagged sources is significantly less than estimates using a traditional stratospheric ozone tracer (8 vs. 20 ppbv at the surface). The commonly used technique of perturbing NO emissions by 20% in a region to determine its ozone contribution is compared to the tagging technique, showing that the tagged ozone is 2-4 times the ozone contribution that was deduced from perturbing emissions.

A spatial and temporal analysis of results based on the 2D surface fields and time series for regional monitoring stations was performed for the main gaseous pollutants. A detailed statistical analysis and evaluation against observations was carried out, considering three different sub-domains over North America, in order to comprehend the differences between the East, West and Central part. The exploitation of modelling results was based on the capabilities and analysis tools available through the ENSEMBLE software, developed and upgraded for AQMEII. Results have shown a good agreement between observed and modelled concentrations of O-3 (especially regarding peaks) and NO2 and a weaker performance of the air quality model for CO and SO2. However, the model tends to underestimate O-3 and overestimate NO2 and CO at night as a consequence of meteorology (weak vertical mixing due to underestimation of the Planetary Boundary Layer (PBL) height).

Previous studies have estimated that animal feed emissions of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) have greater O(3) formation potential than mobile-source VOC emissions when averaging across the entire SJV. The higher spatial resolution in the current study shows that the proximity of oxides of nitrogen (NO(x)) and VOC emissions from mobile sources enhances their O(3) formation potential. Livestock feed VOC emissions contributed 3-4 ppb of peak O(3) (8-h average) in Tulare County and 1-2 ppb throughout the remainder of the SJV during the CCOS 2000 July-August episode.

Applications of satellite observations are discussed for case studies of specific events, for estimates of surface concentrations, and to improve emission inventories of trace gases and aerosols. Aerosol remote sensing at visible wavelengths exhibits high sensitivity to boundary layer concentrations.

The coarse regional scaling preserves sufficient statistics in the satellite data to constrain the interannual variability (IAV) of lightning. After processing the LIS data to remove their diurnal sampling bias, we construct a monthly time series of lightning flash rates for 1998-2010 and 35 degrees S-35 degrees N. We find a correlation of IAV in total tropical lightning with El Nino but not with the solar cycle or the quasi-biennial oscillation. The global lightning NOx source +/- IAV standard deviation in GEOS-Chem is 6.0 +/- 0.5 Tg N yr(-1), compared to 5.5 +/- 0.8 Tg N yr(-1) for the biomass burning source. Lightning NOx could have a large influence on the IAV of tropospheric ozone because it is released in the upper troposphere where ozone production is most efficient.",0,0,1.3.1.3.4,Lightning Nitrogen Oxides (NOX)

However, recent field studies have confirmed that the presence of particulate chloride alters the reaction product to produce nitryl chloride (ClNO2) which undergoes photolysis to generate chlorine atoms and nitrogen dioxide (NO2). Both chlorine and NO2 affect atmospheric chemistry and air quality. We present an updated gas-phase chlorine mechanism that can be combined with the Carbon Bond 05 mechanism and incorporate the combined mechanism into the Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) modeling system. We then update the current model treatment of heterogeneous hydrolysis of N2O5 to include ClNO2 as a product. The model, in combination with a comprehensive inventory of chlorine compounds, reactive nitrogen, particulate matter, and organic compounds, is used to evaluate the impact of the heterogeneous ClNO2 production on air quality across the United States for the months of February and September in 2006. The heterogeneous production increases ClNO2 in coastal as well as many in-land areas in the United States. Particulate chloride derived from sea-salts, anthropogenic sources, and forest fires activates the heterogeneous production of ClNO2. With current estimates of tropospheric emissions, it modestly enhances monthly mean 8-h ozone (up to 1-2 ppbv or 3-4%) but causes large increases (up to 13 ppbv) in isolated episodes. This chemistry also substantially reduces the mean total nitrate by up to 0.8-2.0 mu g m(-3) or 11-21%. Modeled ClNO2 accounts for up to 6% of the monthly mean total reactive nitrogen. Sensitivity results of the model suggest that heterogeneous production of ClNO2 can further increase O-3 and reduce TNO3 if elevated particulate-chloride levels are present in the atmosphere.",0,0,1.4.2,Halogen Chemistry

The new model treatments implemented in CMAQ v4.7 in this work include two online dust emission schemes (i.e., the Zender and Westphal schemes), nine dust-related heterogeneous reactions, an updated aerosol inorganic thermodynamic module ISORROPIA II with an explicit treatment of crustal species, and the interface between ISORROPIA II and the new dust treatments. The resulting improved CMAQ (referred to as CMAQ-Dust), offline-coupled with the Weather Research and Forecast model (WRF), is applied to the April 2001 dust storm episode over the trans-Pacific domain to examine the impact of new model treatments and understand associated uncertainties. WRF/CMAQ-Dust produces reasonable spatial distribution of dust emissions and captures the dust outbreak events, with the total dust emissions of similar to 111 and 223 Tg when using the Zender scheme with an erodible fraction of 0.5 and 1.0, respectively. The model system can reproduce well observed meteorological and chemical concentrations, with significant improvements for suspended particulate matter (PM), PM with aerodynamic diameter of 10 mu m, and aerosol optical depth than the default CMAQ v4.7. The sensitivity studies show that the inclusion of crustal species reduces the concentration of PM with aerodynamic diameter of 2.5 mu m (PM2.5) over polluted areas.

The overall goal of the MASAES was to determine the association of particulate matter on the degree of resulting lung inflammation, with those having severe asthma hypothesized to be more highly susceptible to such outcomes. The primary exposure objective was to determine the spatial (personal versus ambient) and temporal relationships associated with the aforementioned air pollutants and establish the precision of a new dual PM2.5, PM10-2.5 monitor (CPEM) for personal exposure monitoring. A total of 16 non-smoking adults of various asthma severities were monitored over the course of a 14 month period during 2008-2009. Participants were monitored for 24 continuous hours each monitoring day with a maximum of five events per participant. Median personal PM2.5 and PM10-2.5 exposures were 16.5 and 10.1 mu g m(-3), respectively. Daily ambient mass concentrations accounted for less than 1% of the observed variability in personal PM2.5 or PM10-2.5 exposures. Duplicate personal measures yielded R-2 values of 0.92 PM2.5 and 0.77 PM10-2.5, respectively. Maximum daily personal exposures of 17.0 ppb NO2 and 21.7 ppb O-3 occurred with respective mean exposures of 5.8 and 3.4 ppb. Ambient NO2 and O-3 measures were observed to be poorly associated with personal exposures (R-2 < 0.08) when viewed independent of the participant. The poor correlation between personal and ambient concentrations of PM as well as the various gaseous copollutants indicates the complexity of the multi-pollutant environment and the impact of non-ambient sources on these pollutants relative to total personal exposures.

The NMM-CMAQ and ARW-CMAQ models were run on the basis of their original grid structures of the meteorological models. The results at the AIRNow surface sites showed that the model performance for ARW-CMAQ and NMM-CMAQ models was similar and reasonable for the high maximum 8-hr O-3 concentration range (>40 ppbv) with slightly better performance for ARW-CMAQ [the normalized mean bias (NMB) values of ARW-CMAQ and NMM-CMAQ are 8.1 and 9.4%, respectively]. The results of the evaluation using aircraft observations over the Houston-Galveston-Brazoria and Dallas metropolitan areas revealed that both models had similar performances for different chemical species (O-3, CO, PAN, NO2, NO, NOX, HNO3, NOY and ethylene) as both models use the same chemical mechanism and emissions. Both models reproduced the vertical variation patterns of the observed air temperature and water vapor well with the slightly lower values for the ARW-CMAQ model.

Analysis of ozonesondes, lidar, and surface measurements over the western U.S. from April to June 2010 show that a global high-resolution (~50 ? 50 km2) chemistry-climate model (GFDL AM3) captures the observed layered features and sharp ozone gradients of deep stratospheric intrusions, representing a major improvement over previous chemical transport models. Thirteen intrusions enhanced total daily maximum 8-h average (MDA8) ozone to ~70?86 ppbv at surface sites. With a stratospheric ozone tracer defined relative to a dynamically varying tropopause, we find that stratospheric intrusions can episodically increase surface MDA8 ozone by 20?40 ppbv (all model estimates are bias corrected), including on days when observed ozone exceeds the NAAQS threshold. These stratospheric intrusions elevated background ozone concentrations (estimated by turning off North American anthropogenic emissions in the model) to MDA8 values of 60?75 ppbv. At high-elevation western U.S. sites, the 25th?75th percentile of the stratospheric contribution is 15?25 ppbv when observed MDA8 ozone is 60?70 ppbv, and increases to ~17?40 ppbv for the 70?85 ppbv range. These estimates, up to 2?3 times greater than previously reported, indicate a major role for stratospheric intrusions in contributing to springtime high-O3events over the high-altitude western U.S., posing a challenge for staying below the ozone NAAQS threshold, particularly if a value in the 60?70 ppbv range were to be adopted.",0,0,1.3.2.1,Tropopause Folding

in the US during the years 2007-2009. We employ a refined forward trajectory-based approach to  
address the relationship between stratospheric intrusions and enhancements in hourly average O-3  
concentrations. The model is applied to high-resolution European Center for Medium-Range Weather  
Forecasting (ECMWF) analyses to identify specific days when the potential for stratosphere-to- 
troposphere transport (Sir) exists to affect surface O-3 levels. Our results indicate that SIT  
down to the surface (STT-S) frequently contributes to enhanced surface O-3 hourly averaged  
concentrations at sites across the US, with substantial year-to-year variability. The O-3  
concentrations associated with the SIT-S events appear to be large enough to enhance the measured

Rather than focus solely on average ozone values or air quality standard violations, we consider the full range of ozone values, reporting trends for the 5th, 50th and 95th percentiles. Domestic ozone precursor emissions decreased strongly during 1990-2010. Accordingly 83%, 66% and 20% of summertime eastern U.S. sites experienced statistically significant ozone decreases in the 95th, 50th and 5th percentiles, respectively. During spring 43% of the eastern sites have statistically significant ozone decreases for the 95th percentile with no sites showing a significant increase. At the 50th percentile there is little overall change in the eastern U.S. In contrast, only 17% (2 sites) and 8% (1 site) of summertime western U.S. sites have statistically significant ozone decreases in the 95th and 50th percentiles, respectively. During spring no western site has a significant decrease, while 50% have a significant median increase. This dichotomy in U.S. ozone trends is discussed in terms of changing anthropogenic and biomass burning emissions. Consideration is given to the concept that increasing baseline ozone flowing into the western U.S. is counteracting ozone reductions due to domestic emission reductions. An update to the springtime free tropospheric ozone trend above western North America shows that ozone has increased significantly from 1995 to 2011 at the rate of 0.41 +/- 0.27 ppbv yr(-1).

Modeled O(3) and winds are compared to research aircraft measurements and wind profiler data, respectively, to investigate whether model underestimates of daily maximum 8-h ozone concentrations during high O(3) episodes might be attributable to discrepancies in either or both of these modeled processes. Comparisons of 10 AM surface O(3) concentrations, which are representative of O(3) levels in the residual layer aloft, revealed that model underestimation was greater at higher observed ozone levels. Mid-morning vertical ozone profiles corroborated this surface-level finding, as modeled concentrations tended to be lower than observed O(3) aloft. Net ozone production efficiency (OPE) results suggested photochemical ozone formation was comparable between the model and observations with composite OPE values of 6.7 and 7.6, respectively, within the afternoon planetary boundary layer. Evaluation of wind profiles revealed modeled wind speeds with the base four-dimensional data assimilation (FDDA) approach underestimated observed speeds by more than 2 m s(-1) and direction was biased by about 20 degrees in the nocturnal residual layer aloft as coarse resolution analysis fields involved in FDDA were found to inhibit modeled winds. These differences could produce large spatial displacements in modeled and observed ozone patterns within the region. Although sensitivity simulation results with the WRF meteorological model with FDDA using all available upper air profile observations displayed improvements in capturing wind fields aloft, CMAQ maximum 8-h O(3) results using the improved wind fields also underestimated observations.

Variability in air pollutant infiltration due to differential air exchange rates (AERs) is potentially a major factor affecting the relationship between central site concentrations and actual exposure, and may thus influence observed health risk estimates. In this analysis, we examined AER as an effect modifier of associations between several urban air pollutants and corresponding emergency department (ED) visits for asthma and wheeze during a 4-year study period (January 1999-December 2002) for a 186 ZIP code area in metro Atlanta. We found positive associations for the interaction between AER and pollution on asthma ED visits for both carbon monoxide (CO) and nitrogen oxides (NOx), indicating significant or near-significant effect modification by AER on the pollutant risk-ratio estimates. In contrast, the interaction term between particulate matter (PM)2.5 and AER on asthma ED visits was negative and significant. However, alternative distributional tertile analyses showed PM2.5 and AER epidemiological model results to be similar to those found for NOx and CO (namely, increasing risk ratios (RRs) with increasing AERs when ambient PM2.5 concentrations were below the highest tertile of their distribution). Despite the fact that ozone (O3) was a strong independent predictor of asthma ED visits in our main analysis, we found no O3-AER effect modification. To our knowledge, our findings for CO, NOx, and PM2.5 are the first to provide an indication of short-term (i.e., daily) effect modification of multiple air pollution-related risk associations with daily changes in AER. Although limited to one outcome category in a single large urban locale, the findings suggest that the use of relatively simple and easy-to-derive AER surrogates may reflect intraurban differences in short-term exposures to pollutants of ambient origin.Journal of Exposure Science and Environmental Epidemiology advance online publication, 19 June 2013; doi:10.1038/jes.2013.32.",0,0,2.4.2,Infiltration

The experiments were conducted at realistic ozone and limonene concentrations in a 240 m(3) chamber configured to simulate a typical open office environment. During an experiment the chamber was either unoccupied or occupied with 18-20 workers.

Acute and subacute O-3 exposures heightened pulmonary inflammation, edema, and cell death more severely in Nrf2(-/-) mice than in Nrf2(+/+) mice. O-3 caused bronchiolar and terminal bronchiolar proliferation in both genotypes of mice, while the intensity of compensatory epithelial proliferation, bronchial mucous cell hyperplasia, bronchial mucous hypersecretion was greater in Nrf2(-/-) mice than in Nrf2(+/+) mice.

Part I: Dynamical model evaluation","Steyn, DG; Ainslie, B; Reuten, C; Jackson, PL",2013,"We conduct a retrospective study of ozone formation in the Lower Fraser Valley (LFV), using numerical models, observations, and emission inventories in order to understand relationships between reductions in local precursor emissions and episodic ozone concentrations. Because there appears to be little or no impact from precursor emissions upwind of the LFV during ozone episodes and because background concentrations of ozone and its precursors are generally from the North Pacific Ocean and quite low, summertime ozone formation in the LFV is mostly caused by local emissions. The observed change in behaviour of ozone formation must, therefore, arise from reductions in local precursor emissions. We exploit the observed changing precursor emission-ozone concentration relationship to perform a dynamical model evaluation. Complicating the analyses are an observed shift in the population patterns within the valley over the last 25 years and a small but documented change in the tropospheric background concentration of ozone. Ozone formation for four episodes, which capture the observed changes in ozone reduction and the different meteorological types that occur during LFV ozone events, are investigated using the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF)-Sparse Matrix Operator Kernel Emissions (SMOKE)-Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) modelling system. In order to provide realistic simulations of past events, the SMOKE emission inventory is adjusted to account for temporal changes in the amount of emissions and locations of emission sources. Model output is compared with continuous observations, data collected from field campaigns, and previous modelling efforts. The WRF-SMOKE-CMAQ modelling framework is able to capture the changes in both the magnitude of the ozone concentrations and its spatial behaviour over the period of study. Many of the simulations show that the highest ozone concentrations occur outside the area sampled by the fixed monitoring network and within the LFV's numerous tributary valleys. Not all modelled episodes achieved the same agreement with observations and some of these discrepancies are likely related to shortcomings in the meteorological modelling. The model consistently overpredicts ozone at a number of stations within the City of Vancouver and underpredicts daytime NOx concentrations there. Both results are consistent with a deficiency in NOx emissions.

When a model fails to replicate an observed change, a key challenge is to discern whether the discrepancy is caused by errors in meteorological simulations, errors in emission magnitudes and changes, or inaccurate responses of simulated pollutant concentrations to emission changes. In this study, the Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) model is applied to simulate the ozone (O-3) change after the NOx SIP Call and mobile emission controls substantially reduced nitrogen oxides (NOx) emissions in the eastern U.S. from 2002 to 2006. For both modeled and observed O-3, changes in episode average daily maximal 8-h O-3 were highly correlated (R-2 = 0.89) with changes in the 95th percentile, although the magnitudes of reductions increased nonlinearly at high percentile O-3 concentrations. Observed downward changes in mean NOx (-11.6 to -2.5 ppb) and 8-h O-3 (-10.4 to -4.7 ppb) concentrations in metropolitan areas in the NOx SIP Call region were under-predicted by 31%-64% and 26%-66%, respectively. The under-predicted O-3 improvements in the NOx SIP Call region could not be explained by adjusting for temperature biases in the meteorological input, or by considering uncertainties in the chemical reaction rate constants. However, the under-prediction in O-3 improvements could be alleviated by 5%-31% by constraining NOx emissions in each year based on observed NOx concentrations. This demonstrates the crucial need to accurately characterize changes in precursor emissions when dynamically evaluating a model's ability to simulate O-3 responses to those changes.

The model underestimates daytime (8am-8pm LST) O-3 mixing ratios by 13% in the winter for North America, primarily due to an underestimation of daytime O-3 mixing ratios in the middle and lower troposphere from the lateral boundary conditions. The model overestimates winter daytime O-3 mixing ratios in Europe by an average of 8.4%.

A model performance evaluation was conducted by comparing the CMAQ model estimates against ambient air quality measurements. In the Alberta oil sands region, the model tended to achieve or nearly achieve ozone model performance goals, albeit with an underestimation bias. The magnitudes of the observed PM2.5 concentrations were matched by the modeling system, except when the observed PM2.5 concentrations were influenced by emissions from forest fires in which case the model underestimated the observed PM2.5 concentrations. The CMAQ-estimated 4th highest daily maximum 8-hour ozone concentrations in the oil sands region were below the 65 ppb Canada Wide Standard (CWS) as well as the 58 ppb Alberta Management Plan Trigger Level. The highest estimated ozone concentrations occurred near the oil sands development area just north of Fort McMurray with values approaching, but below, the 58 ppb Management Plan Trigger Level; estimated ozone concentrations are much lower in the farther northern portions of the oil sands region. The acute (i.e., maximum 3-day value) SUM60 vegetative ozone exposure metric was mostly less than 100 ppb h, which is below the threshold of concern for crops. However, just north of Fort McMurray there were small areas where the acute SUM60 metric exceeded the 500-700 ppb h threshold of concern for crops with maximum values in plumes from sources in the oil sands mine area of similar to 900 ppb h. The maximum chronic (three-month average) SUM60 ozone exposure metric was below the thresholds of concern.

The framework identifies operational, diagnostic, dynamic, and probabilistic types of model evaluation. Operational evaluation techniques include statistical and graphical analyses aimed at determining whether model estimates are in agreement with the observations in an overall sense. Diagnostic evaluation focuses on process-oriented analyses to determine whether the individual processes and components of the model system are working correctly, both independently and in combination. Dynamic evaluation assesses the ability of the air quality model to simulate changes in air quality stemming from changes in source emissions and/or meteorology, the principal forces that drive the air quality model.

Heterogeneous processes are shown to contribute partly to the observed lower Delta O-3/Delta CO ratios in northern high latitudes versus tropical regions.

Currently available remote sensing techniques utilize backscattered solar ultraviolet (UV) radiances or thermal infrared (TIR) emissions to perform ozone retrievals. However, in the TIR, measurement sensitivity to the LMT requires high thermal contrast between the Earth's surface and the near-surface (tens to hundreds of meters above surface) atmosphere, while in the UV, the measurement sensitivity to the LMT is low because of Rayleigh scattering. In this paper, we explore the feasibility of using multi-spectral intensity measurements in the UV, visible (VIS), mid infrared (MIR) and TIR, and polarization measurements in the UV/VIS, to improve tropospheric and lowermost tropospheric ozone retrievals.

Simulations for 16 cloud and aerosol free atmospheric profiles spanning a range of ozone mixing ratios indicate that adding VIS measurements to UV measurements significantly enhances the sensitivity to lowermost tropospheric ozone, but only makes a slight improvement to the total degrees of freedom for signal (DFS). On the other hand, the combination of UV and TIR significantly improves the total DFS as well as the lowermost tropospheric DFS.

The analysis presented here is a necessary and important first step for defining spectral regions that can meet the GEO-CAPE measurement requirements, and subsequently, the requirements for instrumentation. In this work, the principle of multi-spectral retrievals has been extended from previously published literature and we show that the UV + VIS, UV + TIR and UV + VIS + TIR combinations have the potential to meet the GEO-CAPE measurement requirements for tropospheric ozone. Our analysis includes errors from water and surface properties: further analysis is needed to include temperature, additional gas interferents, clouds, aerosols and more realistic surface properties.

Molar surface loadings were obtained by performing breakthrough experiments in a plug-flow reactor (PFR) packed with beads of glass, polyvinylchloride or zirconium silicate. Reaction rates and probabilities were determined by equilibrating the PFR with both the terpene and the ozone and measuring the ozone consumption rate. To mimic typical indoor conditions, temperatures of 20, 25, and 30 degrees C were used in both types of experiments along with a relative humidity ranging from 10% to 80%. The molar surface loading decreased with increased relative humidity, especially on glass, suggesting that water competed with the terpenes for adsorption sites.

When the coupled system is executed without radiative feedback, computational time is virtually identical when using the Community Atmospheric Model (CAM) radiation option and a slightly increased (similar to 8.5%) when using the Rapid Radiative Transfer Model for GCMs (RRTMG) radiation option in the coupled system compared to the offline WRF-CMAQ system. Once the feedback mechanism is turned on, the execution time increases only slightly with CAM but increases about 60% with RRTMG due to the use of a more detailed Mie calculation in this implementation of feedback mechanism. This two-way model with radiative feedback shows noticeably reduced bias in simulated surface shortwave radiation and 2-m temperatures as well improved correlation of simulated ambient ozone and PM2.5 relative to observed values for a test case with significant tropospheric aerosol loading from California wildfires.",0,0,2.3.2.3,Chemical Transport Modeling

Contributions from biogenic sources, diesel vehicles, highway gasoline vehicles, off-highway gasoline vehicles, solvent utilization, petroleum industries, other industries and wildfires were determined. Peak column-averaged O-3 formation rate due to industrial sources averaged over this episode was approximately 8.5 ppb hr(-1). Contributions of gasoline vehicles and solvent utilization were large in urban areas to the west of the industrial region with highest column-averaged formation rates of 3.7 and 1.4 ppb hr(-1), respectively. Large regional contributions of biogenic sources to O-3 formation were predicted with highest O-3 formation rate of 11.9 ppb hr(-1) in downwind rural areas. Wildfires could contribute to large O-3 formation but their influence was generally localized. Analysis of 2400 back-trajectories from areas with maximum daily 8-h O-3 greater than 90 ppb showed that industrial sources were the largest anthropogenic sources of VOC that contributed to the these high O-3 events, followed by gasoline vehicle sources. The median of relative contributions from biogenic and anthropogenic sources from this analysis was approximately 60% and 40%, respectively. Analysis of the back-trajectories where 1-h peak O-3 concentrations were greater than 120 ppb showed that the median relative contributions due to anthropogenic sources were increased to over 60%.

The predominant method employed to monitor O3 is ultraviolet (UV) photometry. Instruments employ a selective manganese dioxide or heated silver wool &quot;scrubber&quot; to remove O3 to provide a zero reference signal. Unfortunately, such scrubbers remove atmospheric constituents that absorb 254-nm light, causing measurement interference. Water vapor also interferes with the measurement under some circumstances. We report results of a 3-month field test of two new instruments designed to minimize interferences (2B Technologies model 211; Teledyne-API model 265E) that were operated in parallel with a conventional Thermo Scientific model 49C O3 monitor. The field test was hosted by the Houston Regional Monitoring Corporation (HRM). The model 211 photometer scrubs O3 with excess nitric oxide (NO) generated in situ by photolysis of added nitrous oxide (N2O) to provide a reference signal, eliminating the need for a conventional O3 scrubber. The model 265E analyzer directly measures O3-NO chemiluminescence from added excess NO to quantify O3 in the sample stream. Extensive quality control (QC) and collocated monitoring data are assessed to evaluate potential improvements to the accuracy of O3 compliance monitoring. Implications: Two new-technology ozone monitors were compared with a conventional monitor under field conditions. Over 3 months the conventional monitor reported more exceedances of the current standard than the new instruments, which could potentially result in an area being misjudged as &quot;nonattainment.&quot; Instrument drift can affect O3 data accuracy, and the same degree of drift has a proportionally greater compliance effect as standard stringency is increased.

The results show improved model performance for a range of species compared against aircraft observations from the INTEX-NA/ICARTT 2004 field campaign.

We focus our examination on the southeastern United States, which is impacted by both abundant isoprene emissions and high levels of anthropogenic pollutants. We find that NOx concentrations increase by 4?9% as a result of reduced removal by isoprene nitrate chemistry. O3 increases by 2 ppbv as a result of changes in NOx. OH concentrations increase by 30%, which can be primarily attributed to greater HOx production. We find that the model can capture observed total alkyl and multifunctional nitrates (?ANs) and their relationship with O3 by assuming either an isoprene nitrate yield of 6% and daytime lifetime of 6 hours or a yield of 12% and lifetime of 4 h. Uncertainties in the isoprene nitrates can impact ozone production by 10% and OH concentrations by 6%. The uncertainties in NOx recycling efficiency appear to have larger effects than uncertainties in isoprene nitrate yield and dry deposition velocity.

S. in January and July 2002 using a fine-scale horizontal grid resolution of 4-km. Both models moderately overpredict maximum 1-hr and 8-hr ozone (O-3) and fine particulate matter (PM2.5) in January, due likely to a weaker vertical mixing and insufficient dry and wet removal of PM2.5 species simulated by the models. They either slightly underpredict or overpredict O-3 but significantly underpredict PM2.5 in July. The large underprediction in PM2.5 is due to an excess wet deposition removal of sulfate, an excess dry deposition removal of precursors, and an underestimation of emissions of primary PM and precursors of secondary PM and secondary organic aerosol concentrations. Both models show large biases in the simulated concentrations of several gases (e. g., CO in CAMx, NO in CMAQ, NO2 in both models in both months and NH3 by both models in July) and PM species (in particular, nitrate in both months and carbonaceous PM in July), visibility indices, and dry and wet deposition fluxes. They also show some inaccuracies in reproducing temporal variations of NH3, PM2.5, dry and wet deposition fluxes. Differences in model performance between the two models are attributed to different model treatments such as vertical mixing, wet and dry deposition, SOA formation, and PM size representations. These results indicate a need to improve accuracies of the emissions and measurements of NH3, the emissions of primary PM and precursors of secondary PM, as well as model treatments of vertical mixing and dry and wet removal processes.",0,0,2.3.2.3,Chemical Transport Modeling

NO2 comparisons found low biases in CMAQ results when using both ground-and satellite-based observations. Aircraft-based observations, on the other hand, indicated a higher positive bias and error, but the overall NO2 vertical profile was captured well by themodel. The highest correlation was observed with satellite-based NO2 observations indicating that the model and satellite found similar spatial gradients.

The idea is to compare a case's exposure immediately prior to or during the case-defining event with that same person's exposure at otherwise similar ""reference"" times. An alternative approach to the analysis of daily exposure and case-only data is time series analysis. Here, log-linear regression models express the expected total number of events on each day as a function of the exposure level and potential confounding variables. In time series analyses of air pollution, smooth functions of time and weather are the main confounders. Time series and case-crossover methods are often viewed as competing methods. In this paper, we show that case-crossover using conditional logistic regression is a special case of time series analysis when there is a common exposure such as in air pollution studies. This equivalence provides computational convenience for case-crossover analyses and a better understanding of time series models. Time series log-linear regression accounts for overdispersion of the Poisson variance, while case-crossover analyses typically do not.

One recognizes that there may be useful information in the outputs for grid cells that are neighbors of the one in which the location lies. The second acknowledges potential spatial misalignment between a station and its putatively associated grid cell. The first model is a Gaussian Markov random field smoothed downscaler that relates monitoring station data and computer model output via the introduction of a latent Gaussian Markov random field linked to both sources of data. The second model is a smoothed downscaler with spatially varying random weights defined through a latent Gaussian process and an exponential kernel function, that yields, at each site, a new variable on which the monitoring station data is regressed with a spatial linear model. We applied both methods to daily ozone concentration data for the Eastern US during the summer months of June, July and August 2001, obtaining, respectively, a 5% and a 15% predictive gain in overall predictive mean square error over our earlier downscaler model (Berrocal et al., 2010b).

Model ozone using the assimilated meteorological fields with improved wind fields shows better agreement with the observation compared to the forecasting results. In the post-frontal conditions, important factors for ozone modeling in terms of wind patterns are the weak easterlies in the morning for bringing in industrial emissions to the city and the subsequent clockwise turning of the wind direction induced by the Coriolis force superimposing the sea breeze, which keeps pollutants in the urban area. Objective analysis and nudging employed in the retrospective simulation minimize the wind bias but are not able to compensate for the general flow pattern biases inherited from large scale inputs. By using an alternative analyses data for initializing the meteorological simulation, the model can re-produce the flow pattern and generate the ozone peak location closer to the reality. The inaccurate simulation of precipitation and cloudiness cause over-prediction of ozone occasionally. Since there are limitations in the meteorological model to simulate precipitation and cloudiness in the fine scale domain (less than 4-km grid), the satellite-based cloud is an alternative way to provide necessary inputs for the retrospective study of air quality.

An underestimation of nighttime mixing in the urban areas appears to contribute to the overestimation of trace metals. Removing the anthropogenic fugitive dust (AFD) emissions and the effects of wind-blown dust (WBD) lowered the model soil concentrations. However, even with both AFD emissions and WBD effects removed, soil concentrations were still often overestimated, suggesting that there are other sources of errors in the modeling system that contribute to the overestimation of soil components.

As such, wildfires contribute to elevated ozone (O3) in the atmosphere. However, there is a large amount of variability in the emissions of O3 precursors and the amount of O3 produced between fires. There is also significant interannual variability as seen in median O3, organic carbon and satellite derived carbon monoxide mixing ratios in the western U.S. To better understand O3 produced from wildfires, we developed a statistical model that estimates the maximum daily 8 h average (MDA8) O3 as a function of several meteorological and temporal variables for three urban areas in the western U.S.: Salt Lake City, UT; Boise, ID; and Reno, NV. The model is developed using data from June-September 2000-2012. For these three locations, the statistical model can explain 60, 52, and 27% of the variability in daily MDA8. The Statistical Model Residual (SMR) can give information on additional sources of O3 that are not explained by the usual meteorological pattern. Several possible O3 sources can explain high SMR values on any given day. We examine several cases with high SMR that are due to wildfire influence. The first case considered is for Reno in June 2008 when the MDA8 reached 82 ppbv. The wildfire influence for this episode is supported by PM concentrations, the known location of wildfires at the time and simulations with the Weather and Research Forecasting Model with Chemistry (WRF-Chem) which indicates transport to Reno from large fires burning in California. The contribution to the MDA8 in Reno from the California wildfires is estimated to be 26 ppbv, based on the SMR, and 60 ppbv, based on WRF-Chem. The WRF-Chem model also indicates an important role for peroxyacetyl nitrate (PAN) in producing O3 during transport from the California wildfires. We hypothesize that enhancements in PAN due to wildfire emissions may lead to regional enhancements in O3 during high fire years. The second case is for the Salt Lake City (SLC) region for August 2012. During this period the MDA8 reached 83 ppbv and the SMR suggests a wildfire contribution of 19 ppbv to the MDA8. The wildfire influence is supported by PM2.5 data, the known location of wildfires at the time, HYSPLIT dispersion modeling that indicates transport from fires in Idaho, and results from the CMAQ model that confirm the fire impacts. Concentrations of PM2.5 and O3 are enhanced during this period, but overall there is a poor relationship between them, which is consistent with the complexities in the secondary production of O3. A third case looks at high MDA8 in Boise, ID, during July 2012 and reaches similar conclusions. These results support the use of statistical modeling as a tool to quantify the influence from wildfires on urban O3 concentrations.",0,0,2.8,Evidence Inventories?????Data Tables to Provide Supporting Information

A common strategy in environmental epidemiology is to use a first-stage (exposure) model to estimate the exposure based on covariates and/or spatio-temporal proximity and to use predictions from the exposure model as the covariate of interest in the second-stage (health) model. This induces a complex form of measurement error. We propose an analytical framework and methodology that is robust to misspecification of the first-stage model and provides valid inference for the second-stage model parameter of interest. We decompose the measurement error into components analogous to classical and Berkson error and characterize properties of the estimator in the second-stage model if the first-stage model predictions are plugged in without correction. Specifically, we derive conditions for compatibility between the first- and second-stage models that guarantee consistency (and have direct and important real-world design implications), and we derive an asymptotic estimate of finite-sample bias when the compatibility conditions are satisfied. We propose a methodology that (1) corrects for finite-sample bias and (2) correctly estimates standard errors.

Routine evaluation using near-real-time AIRNow ozone measurements through 2011 showed better performance of the operational ozone predictions. In this work, quality-controlled and -assured Air Quality System (AQS) ozone and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) observations are used to evaluate the experimental predictions in 2010. It is found that both ozone and NO2 are overestimated over the contiguous US (CONUS), with annual biases of +5.6 and +5.1 ppbv, respectively. The annual root mean square errors (RMSEs) are 15.4 ppbv for ozone and 13.4 ppbv for NO2. For both species the overpredictions are most pronounced in the summer. The locations of the AQS monitoring sites are also utilized to stratify comparisons by the degree of urbanization. Comparisons for six predefined US regions show the highest annual biases for ozone predictions in Southeast (+10.5 ppbv) and for NO2 in the Lower Middle (+8.1 ppbv) and Pacific Coast (+7.1 ppbv) regions. The spatial distributions of the NO2 biases in August show distinctively high values in the Los Angeles, Houston, and New Orleans areas. In addition to the standard statistics metrics, daily maximum eight-hour ozone categorical statistics are calculated using the current US ambient air quality standard (75 ppbv) and another lower threshold (70 ppbv). Using the 75 ppbv standard, the hit rate and proportion of correct over CONUS for the entire year are 0.64 and 0.96, respectively. Summertime biases show distinctive weekly patterns for ozone and NO2. Diurnal comparisons show that ozone overestimation is most severe in the morning, from 07:00 to 10:00 local time.

Basin during the CalNex-2010 field campaign (May June 2010) have been evaluated by analyzing O-3 and NOy (NO, NO2, HNO3, PAN) observations using a regional air quality model (WRF-Chem). Model simulations were conducted at 4-km spatial resolution over the basin using the Carbon-Bond Mechanism version Z (CBM-Z) and NOx emissions reduced by 24% relative to 2005 National Emissions Inventory (NEI'05), according to recent state emission statistics (BASE_NOx scenario). In addition, a 22-26% NOx emission reduction from weekday to weekend was applied. WRF-Chem reproduced the observed diurnal cycle and day-to-day variations in surface O-3, O-x, HNO3 and HCHO (correlation r(2) = 0.57 - 0.63; pairs of data n > 400; confidence value p < 0.01) at the CalNex supersite at Caltech but consistently overestimated surface NO and NO2. A 45% reduction of NOx emissions relative to NEI'05 (LOW_NOx scenario), as suggested by the OMI-NO2 column trend in California over the same period, improved the agreement of modeled NO2, NO3, and O-3 with observations on weekdays. Three-dimensional distributions of daytime O-3 and NO were compared with five daytime NOAA WP-3D flights (three on weekdays and two on weekends) to study the Weekend-to-Weekday (WE-to-WD) effects by using the LOW_NOx scenario. Aircraft data showed a 17.3 ppb O-3 increase and a 54% NOy reduction in the boundary layer on weekends relative to weekdays, while modeled WE-to-MID differences were much smaller, with a 2.9 ppb O-3 increase and 16% NOy reduction only. Model results on weekends underestimated O-3 by 23% and overestimated NO and HNO3 by 40% and 27%, respectively, which may indicate that weekend NO3 emissions (45% reduction relative to NEI'05 with a 22-26% reduction on weekends compared to weekdays) were still overestimated in the model. Comparisons of PAN to HNO3 ratios also indicated that the enhanced photochemistry on weekends was not well represented in the model. Although modeled weekday O-3 was close to the observations in the boundary layer, modeled PAN and HNO3 were overestimated by 30% and 22%, respectively, and modeled NOy was underestimated by 24% on weekdays. Interpreted as emission ratios, the slopes of volatile organic compound (VOC) species versus CO concentrations indicated that speciated VOC emissions in the model were not accurately represented, impacting the photochemistry in the model. These findings argue for the need to improve our understanding of VOC emissions and their photochemical processing in the model. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

By comparing GOME-2 NO2 columns to corresponding CMAQ NO2 columns, we produced satellite-adjusted NOx emission (""GOME2009"") and compared baseline emission (""BASE2009"") CMAQ simulations with GOME2009 CMAQ runs. We found that the latter exhibited decreases of -5.6%, -12.3%, -21.3%, and -15.9% over the PC, RM, LM, and SE regions, respectively, and increases of +2.3% and +10.0% over the UM and NE regions. In addition, we found that changes in NOx emissions generally mitigate discrepancies between the surface NOx concentrations of baseline CMAQ and those of AQS at EPA AQS stations (mean bias of +19.8% to -13.7% over PC, -13.8% to -36.7% over RM, +149.7% to -1.8% over LM, +22.5% to -7.8% over UM, +31.3% to -7.9% over SE, and +11.6% to +0.7% over NE). The relatively high simulated NOx biases from baseline CMAQ over LM (+149.7%) are likely the results of over-predictions of simulated NOx emissions, which could shed light on those from global/regional Chemical Transport Models. We also perform more detailed investigations on surface NOx and O-3 concentrations in two urban and outflow areas, PC (e.g., Los Angeles, South Pasadena, Anaheim, La Habra and Riverside) and LM (e.g., Houston, Beaumont and Sulphur). From two case studies, we found that the GOME2009 emissions decreased surface NOx concentrations significantly in the urban areas of PC (up to 30 ppbv) and in those of LM (up to 10 ppbv) during the daytime and that simulated NOx concentrations from CMAQ with GOME2009 compare well to those of in-situ AQS observations. A significant reduction in NOx concentrations resulted in a comparable increase in surface O-3 concentrations in the urban areas of PC (up to 30 ppbv) and the resulting simulated O-3 concentrations compare well with in-situ surface O-3 observations over South Pasadena, Anaheim, and Riverside. Over Houston, Beaumont, and Sulphur, large reductions in NOx emissions from CMAQ with GOME2009 coincides with large reduced concentrations of simulated NOx. These concentrations are similar to those of the EPA AQS NOx observations. However, the resulting simulated increase in surface O-3 at the urban stations in Houston and Sulphur exacerbated preexisting high O-3 over-predictions of the baseline CMAQ. This study implies that simulated low O-3 biases in the urban areas of PC are likely caused by simulated high NOx biases, but high O-3 biases in the urban areas of LM cannot be explained by simulated high NOx biases over the region. This study also suggests that both in-situ surface NOx and O-3 observations should be used simultaneously to resolve issues pertaining to simulated high/low O-3 bias and that remote-sensing data could be used as a constraint for bottom-up emissions. In addition, we also found that daytime O-3 reductions over the outflow regions of LM following large reductions in NOx emissions in the urban areas are significantly larger than they are over outflow regions of PC.

Assessing the role of pollution transport in relation to local emissions and meteorology is especially important in light of possibly lower ozone standards and projected increases in transpacific pollution transport. We apply the Weather Research and Forecasting with Chemistry model to analyze the role of upwind pollution (""inflow"") to surface ozone over California during the Arctic Research of the Composition of the Troposphere from Aircraft and Satellites campaign in June-July 2008 over California. Comparisons of the model to surface and aircraft observations, ozonesondes, and satellite retrievals show an overall good agreement; a low bias (similar to 5 ppb) in free tropospheric ozone is attributed to low ozone at the boundaries and likely places our estimated inflow contribution on the lower side. Most other studies applied sensitivity analyses, while we use a synthetic ozone tracer, which provides a quantitative estimate of the budget. We estimate that on average 10 +/- 9 ppb of surface afternoon ozone over California is attributed to ozone and ozone precursors entering the region from outside. This contribution features a significant spatial and temporal variability. While in most high ozone events, transported pollution plays a small role compared to local influences, for some instances, the impact can be substantial. Omitting data impacted by wildfires, we estimate the 90th percentile of the relative contribution of O-3(INFLOW) to 8 h ozone &gt;75 ppb as 10%.

The OA used in this study combines model outputs from the Canadian air quality forecast suite with US and Canadian observations from various air quality surface monitoring networks. The analyses are based on an optimal interpolation (OI) with capabilities for adaptive error statistics for ozone and PM2.5 and an explicit bias correction scheme for the PM2.5 analyses. The estimation of error statistics has been computed using a modified version of the Hollingsworth-Lonnberg (H-L) method. The error statistics are ""tuned"" using a chi(2) (chi-square) diagnostic, a semi-empirical procedure that provides significantly better verification than without tuning. Successful cross-validation experiments were performed with an OA setup using 90% of data observations to build the objective analyses and with the remainder left out as an independent set of data for verification purposes. Furthermore, comparisons with other external sources of information (global models and PM2.5 satellite surface-derived or ground-based measurements) show reasonable agreement. The multi-year analyses obtained provide relatively high precision with an absolute yearly averaged systematic error of less than 0.6 ppbv (parts per billion by volume) and 0.7 mu g m(-3) (micrograms per cubic meter) for ozone and PM2.5, respectively, and a random error generally less than 9 ppbv for ozone and under 12 mu g m(-3) for PM2.5. This paper focuses on two applications: (1) presenting long-term averages of OA and analysis increments as a form of summer climatology; and (2) analyzing long-term (decadal) trends and inter-annual fluctuations using OA outputs. The results show that high percentiles of ozone and PM2.5 were both following a general decreasing trend in North America, with the eastern part of the United States showing the most widespread decrease, likely due to more effective pollution controls. Some locations, however, exhibited an increasing trend in the mean ozone and PM2.5, such as the northwestern part of North America (northwest US and Alberta). Conversely, the low percentiles are generally rising for ozone, which may be linked to the intercontinental transport of increased emissions from emerging countries. After removing the decadal trend, the inter-annual fluctuations of the high percentiles are largely explained by the temperature fluctuations for ozone and to a lesser extent by precipitation fluctuations for PM2.5. More interesting is the economic short-term change (as expressed by the variation of the US gross domestic product growth rate), which explains 37% of the total variance of inter-annual fluctuations of PM2.5 and 15% in the case of ozone.",0,0,2.3.2.4,Hybrid Approaches

Using the finest modeled concentrations (12 km), we estimate that 66,000 (95% CI, 39,300 - 84,500) all-cause and 21,400 (5,600 - 34,200) respiratory deaths per year are attributable to PM2.5 and O3 concentrations above low-concentration thresholds, respectively. Using model results at 36 km resolution gives mortality burdens that are 11% higher for PM2.5 and 12% higher for O3 than the 12 km estimates, suggesting a modest positive bias. We also scale modeled concentrations at 12 km to coarser resolutions by simple averaging, and repeat the mortality assessment at multiple resolutions from 24 to 408 km, including the resolutions of global models; in doing so, we account for the effect of resolution on population exposure. Coarse grid resolutions produce mortality estimates that are substantially biased low for PM2.5 (30-40% lower than the 12 km estimate at &gt;250 km resolution), but less than 6% higher for O3 at any resolution. Mortality estimates for primary PM2.5 species show greater bias at coarse resolution than secondary species. These results suggest that coarse resolution global models (&gt;100 km) are likely biased low for PM2.5 health effects. For ozone, biases due to coarse resolution may be much smaller, and the effect on modeled chemistry likely dominates.",0,0,2.6.2,Long Term Exposure

We modeled work-time exposures using field data on indoor and outdoor ozone and particulate matter from four case studies in naturally ventilated offices and published data from mechanically ventilated offices. We also modeled the amount of time that windows would be open in the naturally ventilated office and used the results to estimate the difference in pollutant exposures for occupants of naturally ventilated versus mechanically ventilated, air-conditioned offices. Based on published concentration response equations, we estimated the incremental changes in health outcomes that resulted from the difference in exposures for occupants in the two types of offices. We also estimated the differences in sick building symptom rates based on symptom prevalence rates in naturally ventilated and air-conditioned offices. Finally, we developed first-order estimates of the health-related costs and benefits of retrofitting 10 percent of California's current office space to use natural ventilation. Findings included an increase in annual health-related costs from increased exposure to ozone and particulate matter of between $130 million and $207 million, and a reduction in sick building syndrome symptom costs, valued between $43 million and $11.5 million. Our estimates have a high degree of uncertainty and exclude potentially significant health-related costs and benefits of both naturally ventilated and air-conditioned buildings. Nonetheless, these estimates indicate that health-related costs of natural ventilation are significant and warrant further study. We also explore several mitigation options that could limit the health and economic impacts of natural ventilation. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",0,0,2.4.2,Infiltration

To investigate this, we conducted a case-crossover study of summertime ambient ozone and fine particulate matter (PM(2.5)) levels and daily respiratory hospitalizations in New York City during 2001-2005. Comparisons were made between associations estimated using two pollutant exposure metrics: observed concentrations and predicted exposures from the EPA's Stochastic Human Exposure and Dose Simulation (SHEDS) model. Small, positive associations between interquartile range mean ozone concentrations and hospitalizations were observed and were strongest for 0-day lags (hazard ratio (HR)=1.013, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.998, 1.029) and 3-day lags (HR=1.006, 95% CI: 0.991, 1.021); applying mean predicted ozone exposures yielded similar results. PM(2.5) was also associated with admissions, strongest at 2- and 4-day lags, with few differences between exposure metrics. Subgroup analyses support recognized sociodemographic differences in concentration-related hospitalization risk, whereas few inter-stratum variations were observed in relation to SHEDS exposures. Predicted exposures for these spatially homogenous pollutants were similar across sociodemographic strata, therefore SHEDS predictions coupled with the case-crossover design may have masked observable heterogeneity in risks.

O(3) reacts with epithelial lining fluid (ELF) components in an anatomically site-specific manner dictated by O(3) concentration, airway flow patterns, and ELF substrate concentration. Accordingly, the anatomical distribution of ELF reaction products and airway injury are hypothesized to produce selective DC maturation differentially within the airways. To investigate how O(3) affects regional airway DC populations, we utilized a model of O(3)-induced pulmonary inflammation, wherein C57BL/6 mice were exposed to 0.8 ppm O(3) 8 h/day for 1, 3, and 5 days. This model induced mild inflammation and no remarkable epithelial injury. Tracheal, but not more distant airway sites, and mediastinal lymph node (MLN) DC numbers were increased significantly after the third exposure day. The largest increase in each tissue was of the CD103(+) DC phenotype. After 3 days of exposure, fewer DCs expressed CD80, CD40, and CCR7, and, at this same time point, total MLN T cell numbers increased. Together, these data demonstrate that O(3) exposure induced site-specific and phenotype changes in the pulmonary and regional lymph node DC populations. Possibly contributing to ozone-mediated asthma perturbation, the phenotypic changes to DCs within pulmonary regions may alter responses to antigenic stimuli. Decreased costimulatory molecule expression within the MLN suggests induction of tolerance mechanisms; increased tracheal DC number may raise the potential for allergic sensitization and asthmatic exacerbation, thus overcoming O(3)-induced decrements in costimulatory molecule expression.",0,0,3.1.3,Biological Plausibility

We identified two to six major transport events from SoCal to different subregions in the mountain states, with transport times of 0-2days indicated by trajectories, time-lag correlations, and forward/adjoint sensitivities. Based on forward sensitivity analysis, the contributions from SoCal anthropogenic emissions to the monthly mean daily maximum 8 h average (MDA8) surface O-3 in the mountain states decrease with distance from SoCal, and they range from <1 ppbv (in Wyoming) to 15 ppbv (in western Arizona). These contributions show medium (>0.6) to strong (>0.8) positive correlations with the modeled total surface MDA8 O-3. For the most strongly affected states of Arizona and New Mexico, these contributions have median values of similar to 3, similar to 2, similar to 5, and similar to 15 ppbv when the total surface MDA8 O-3 exceeded thresholds of 60, 65, 70, and 75 ppbv, respectively. Surface MDA8 O-3 values in SoCal show strong nonlinear responses to varied magnitudes of perturbation (e.g., 50% and 100%) in SoCal anthropogenic emissions and weak nonlinear responses in the mountain states. Case studies show that different scales of transport (e.g., trans-Pacific, stratospheric intrusions, and interstate) can be dynamically and chemically coupled and simultaneously affect O-3 in the mountain states when the meteorological conditions are favorable. During some of these strong transport periods, the contributions of SoCal anthropogenic emissions to hourly O-3 in the mountain states can exceed 20 ppbv, close to the magnitude during a summer event reported by Langford et al. (2010). Satellite observations from the Tropospheric Emission Spectrometer and the Measurements of Pollution in the Troposphere multispectral retrievals qualitatively demonstrate large and interstate scales of transport, respectively.

The analysis focuses on identifying temporal and spatial features that can be used to stratify operational model evaluation metrics and to test the extent to which the various modeling systems can replicate the features seen in the observations. Using a synoptic map typing approach, it is demonstrated that model performance varies with meteorological conditions associated with specific synoptic-scale flow patterns over both eastern NA and EU. For example, the root mean square error of simulated daily maximum 8-hr ozone was twice as high when cloud fractions were high compared with when cloud fractions were low over eastern NA. Furthermore, results show that over both NA and EU the regional models participating in AQMEII were able to better reproduce the observed variance in ambient ozone levels than the global model used to specify chemical boundary conditions, although the variance simulated by almost all regional models is still less that the observed variance on all spatiotemporal scales.

We isolate contributions from lightning, wildfires, the stratosphere, and California pollution. Lightning emissions are constrained by observations and wildfire emissions are estimated from daily fire reports. We find that lightning increases mean surface ozone in summer by 10 ppbv in the Intermountain West, with moderate variability. Wildfire plumes generate high-ozone events in excess of 80 ppbv in GEOS-Chem, but CASTNet ozone observations in the Intermountain West show no enhancements during these events nor do they show evidence of regional fire influence. Models may overestimate ozone production in fresh fire plumes because of inadequate chemistry and grid-scale resolution. The highest ozone concentrations observed in the Intermountain West (&gt; 75 ppbv) in spring are associated with stratospheric intrusions. The model captures the timing of these intrusions but not their magnitude, reflecting numerical diffusion intrinsic to Eulerian models. This can be corrected statistically through a relationship between model bias and the model-diagnosed magnitude of stratospheric influence; with this correction, models may still be useful to forecast and interpret high-ozone events from stratospheric intrusions. We show that discrepancy between models in diagnosing stratospheric influence is due in part to differences in definition, i.e., whether stratospheric ozone is diagnosed as produced in the stratosphere (GEOS-Chem definition) or as transported from above the tropopause. The latter definition can double the diagnosed stratospheric influence in surface air by labeling as 'stratospheric' any ozone produced in the troposphere and temporarily transported to the stratosphere.

While the largest fraction of these reactive gases is released by anthropogenic emission sources, a significant amount can be attributed to vegetation fires. In this study, NO2 from GOME2 on board EUMETSAT's MetOp-A and OMI on board NASA's Aura as well as fire radiative power (FRP) from the measurements of MODIS on board NASA's Terra and Aqua satellites are used to derive fire emission rates (FERs) of NOx for different types of vegetation using a simple statistical approach. Monthly means of tropospheric NO2 vertical columns (TVC NO2) have been analyzed for their temporal correlation with the monthly means of FRP for five consecutive years from 2007 to 2011 on a horizontal 1 degrees x 1 degrees grid. The strongest correlation is found to be largely confined to tropical and subtropical regions, which account for more than 80% of yearly burned area, on average, globally. In these regions, the seasonal variation of fire intensity, expressed by the FRP data, is similar to the pattern of TVC NO2. As chemical models typically require values for the amount of NOx being released as a function of time, we have converted the retrieved TVC NO2 into production rates of NOx from fire (P-f) by assuming a constant lifetime of NOx. The comparison between P-f and NOx emissions from the Global Fire Emissions Database (GFEDv3.1) over 5 characteristic biomass burning regions in the tropics and subtropics shows good agreement. By separating the monthly means of P-f and FRP according to land cover type, FERs of NOx could be derived for different biomes. The estimated FERs for the dominating types of vegetation burned are lowest for open shrublands and savannas (0.28-1.03 g NOx s(-1) MW-1) and highest for croplands and woody savannas (0.82-1.56 g NOx s(-1) MW-1). This analysis demonstrates that the strong empirical relationship between TVC NO2 and FRP and the following simplified assumptions are a useful tool for the characterization of NOx emission rates from vegetation fires in the tropics and subtropics.

Intensive operational periods (IOPs) of ambient monitoring were performed, which included comprehensive surface and boundary layer measurements. On IOP days, maximum O-3 values are restricted to a very shallow surface layer. Low wind speeds in combination with low mixing layer heights (similar to 50 m above ground level around noontime) are essential for accumulation of pollutants within the UGRB.

Measurements at the Boulder monitoring site during these time periods under SW wind flow conditions show the lowest NMHC / NOx ratios (similar to 50), reflecting a relatively low reactive NMHC mixture, and a change from a NOx-limited regime towards a NMHC-limited regime as indicated by photochemical indicators, e.g., O-3 /NOy, O-3 /NOz, and O-3 / HNO3 and the EOR (extent of reaction). OH production on IOP days is mainly due to nitrous acid (HONO). On a 24 h basis and as determined for a measurement height of 1.80 m above the surface HONO photolysis on IOP days can contribute similar to 83% to OH production on average, followed by alkene ozonolysis (similar to 9%). Photolysis by ozone and HCHO photolysis contribute about 4% each to hydroxyl formation. High HONO levels (maximum hourly median on IOP days: 1096 pptv - parts per trillion by volume) are favored by a combination of shallow boundary layer conditions and enhanced photolysis rates due to the high albedo of the snow surface. HONO is most likely formed through (i) abundant nitric acid (HNO3) produced in atmospheric oxidation of NOx, deposited onto the snow surface and undergoing photo-enhanced heterogeneous conversion to HONO (estimated HONO production: 10.2 +/- 40% ppbv h(-1)) and (ii) combustion-related emission of HONO (estimated HONO production: similar to 0.1 +/- 30% ppbv h(-1)). HONO production is confined to the lowermost 10 m of the boundary layer. HONO, serves as the most important precursor for OH, strongly enhanced due to the high albedo of the snow cover (HONO photolysis rate 10.7 +/- 30% ppbv h(-1)). OH radicals will oxidize NMHCs, mostly aromatics (toluene, xylenes) and alkanes (ethane, propane), eventually leading to an increase in ozone.",0,0,1.4.1,Winter Ozone in Western Intermountain Basins

We present an approach for quantitative comparisons of model results with measurements for seasonally averaged O-3 concentrations. There is considerable qualitative agreement between the measurements and the models, but there are also substantial and consistent quantitative disagreements. Most notably, models (1) overestimate absolute O3 mixing ratios, on average by similar to 5 to 17 ppbv in the year 2000, (2) capture only similar to 50% of O-3 changes observed over the past five to six decades, and little of observed seasonal differences, and (3) capture similar to 25 to 45% of the rate of change of the long-term changes. These disagreements are significant enough to indicate that only limited confidence can be placed on estimates of present-day radiative forcing of tropospheric O-3 derived from modeled historic concentration changes and on predicted future O-3 concentrations. Evidently our understanding of tropospheric O-3, or the incorporation of chemistry and transport processes into current chemical climate models, is incomplete. Modeled O-3 trends approximately parallel estimated trends in anthropogenic emissions of NOx, an important O-3 precursor, while measured O-3 changes increase more rapidly than these emission estimates.",0,0,1.8.2.4,Long Term Trends in U.S. Background (USB) and Baseline Ozone

This variability stems from both the episodic nature of fires, and from fire conditions such as the modified combustion efficiency of the fire, the nitrogen content of the fuel and possibly other factors that have not been identified or evaluated by comparison with observations. Satellite instruments offer an opportunity to observe emissions from wildfires, providing a large suite of measurements which allow us to study mean behavior and variability on the regional scale in a statistically rigorous manner. Here we use space-based measurements of fire radiative power from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer in combination with NO2 tropospheric column densities from the Ozone Monitoring Instrument to measure mean emission coefficients (ECs in gNOMJ(-1)) from fires for global biomes, and across a wide range of smaller-scale ecoregions, defined as spatially-distinct clusters of fires with similar fuel type. Mean ECs for all biomes fall between 0.250-0.362 gNOMJ(-1), a range that is smaller than found in previous studies of biome-scale emission factors. The majority of ecoregion ECs fall within or near this range, implying that under most conditions, mean fire emissions of NOx per unit energy are similar between different regions regardless of fuel type or spatial variability. In contrast to these similarities, we find that about 24% of individual ecoregion ECs deviate significantly (with 95% confidence) from the mean EC for the associated biome, and a similar number of ecoregion ECs falls outside the range of all mean biome ECs, implying that there are some regions where fuel type-specific global emission parameterizations fail to capture local fire NOx emissions.",0,0,1.3.1.3.3,Landscape Fires

By reacting with hydroxyl radicals, methane reduces the oxidizing capacity of the atmosphere and generates ozone in the troposphere. Although most sources and sinks of methane have been identified, their relative contributions to atmospheric methane levels are highly uncertain. As such, the factors responsible for the observed stabilization of atmospheric methane levels in the early 2000s, and the renewed rise after 2006, remain unclear. Here, we construct decadal budgets for methane sources and sinks between 1980 and 2010, using a combination of atmospheric measurements and results from chemical transport models, ecosystem models, climate chemistry models and inventories of anthropogenic emissions. The resultant budgets suggest that data-driven approaches and ecosystem models overestimate total natural emissions. We build three contrasting emission scenarios - which differ in fossil fuel and microbial emissions - to explain the decadal variability in atmospheric methane levels detected, here and in previous studies, since 1985. Although uncertainties in emission trends do not allow definitive conclusions to be drawn, we show that the observed stabilization of methane levels between 1999 and 2006 can potentially be explained by decreasing-to-stable fossil fuel emissions, combined with stable-to-increasing microbial emissions. We show that a rise in natural wetland emissions and fossil fuel emissions probably accounts for the renewed increase in global methane levels after 2006, although the relative contribution of these two sources remains uncertain.",0,0,1.3.1.2.1,Global Methane

In this work, the online-coupled Weather Research and Forecasting Model with Chemistry with the Model of Aerosol Dynamics, Reaction, Ionization and Dissolution (WRF/Chem-MADRID) is used to forecast ozone (O-3) and fine particles (PM2.5) concentrations over the southeastern U.S. for three O-3 during 2009-2010, 2010-2011, and 2011-2012. The forecasted chemical concentrations and meteorological variables are evaluated with observations from networks data in terms of spatial distribution, temporal variation, and discrete and categorical performance statistics. The model performs well for O-3 and satisfactorily for PM2.5 in terms of both discrete and categorical evaluations but larger biases exist in PM species. The model biases are due to uncertainties in meteorological predictions, emissions, boundary conditions, chemical reactions, as well as uncertainties/differences in the measurement data used for evaluation. Sensitivity simulations show that using MEGAN online biogenic emissions and satellite-derived wildfire emissions result in improved performance for PM2.5 despite a degraded performance for O-3. A combination of both can reduce normalize mean bias of PM2.5 from -18.3% to -11.9%. This work identifies a need to improve the accuracy of emissions by using dynamic biogenic and fire emissions that are dependent on meteorological conditions, in addition to the needs for more accurate anthropogenic emissions for urban areas and more accurate meteorological forecasts.

Four two-day episodes in 2010 are chosen based on plume transport patterns: 1) May 15-16 (plume north), 2) May 29-30 (plume southwest), 3) June 4-5 (plume east), and 4) June 13-14 (plume southeast). Generally, the predicted O-3 spatial patterns and temporal variations agree well with the observations at the ambient monitoring sites in the San Diego-Tijuana region, but in the Calexico-Mexicali region, the model frequently underestimates the observation. In the San Diego-Tijuana region, the morning anthropogenic precursor emissions in the urbanized coastal plain are carried inland and mixed with the local biogenic emissions during transport, causing the high O-3 level over the mountain region. Biogenic emissions enhance the O-3 concentrations by up to 40 ppb over the mountain region in the afternoon. The factor separation approach is used to evaluate the contributions of trans-boundary transport of emissions from California and Baja California to the O-3 level in the California Mexico border region. The Baja California emissions play a minor role in the O-3 formation in the San Diego region and do not seem to contribute to the O-3 exceedances in the region, but have large potential to cause O-3 exceedances in the Calexico region. The California emissions can considerably enhance the O-3 level in the Tijuana region. Generally, the California emissions play a more important role than the Baja California emissions on O-3 formation in the border region (within 40 km to the California Mexico border). On average, the O-3 concentrations in the border region are decreased by 2-4 ppb in the afternoon due to the interactions of emissions from California and Baja California. Further studies need to be conducted to improve the sea breeze simulations in the border region for evaluating O-3 formation. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Next, pollutant-specific relative risks (RRs) obtained from epidemiologic analyses of the alternative exposure metrics were evaluated against those obtained from using a conventional approach (i.e., central site data alone).

Before field deployment, the entire set of instruments was colocated with reference instruments for at least 48 h, comparing hourly averaged data. The standard error of estimate over a typical range 0-50 ppb for the set was 3 +/- 2 ppb. Long-term accuracy was assessed over several months by colocation of a subset of ten instruments each at a different reference site. The differences (GSS-reference) of hourly average ozone concentration were normally distributed with mean -1 ppb and standard deviation 6 ppb (6000 measurement pairs). Instrument failures in the field were detected using network correlations and consistency checks on the raw sensor resistance data. Comparisons with modeled spatial O-3 fields demonstrate the enhanced monitoring capability of a network that was a hybrid of low-cost and reference instruments, in which GSS sensors are used both to increase station density within a network as well as to extend monitoring into remote areas. This ambitious deployment exposed a number of challenges and lessons, including the logistical effort required to deploy and maintain sites over a summer period, and deficiencies in cell phone communications and battery life. Instrument failures at remote sites suggested that redundancy should be built into the network (especially at critical sites) as well as the possible addition of a ""sleep-mode"" for GSS monitors. At the network design phase, a more objective approach to optimize interstation distances, and the ""information"" content of the network is recommended.

Specifically, we consider hourly contributions from global tropospheric O-3 entering North America, stratospheric O-3 over North America, and natural O-3 formed from continental biogenic, fire, and lightning sources according to CAMx source apportionment calculations. Unlike historical modeled background definitions that reflect the absence of anthropogenic emissions, we define ""EmissionsInfluenced Background"" (EIB), which includes chemical interactions with anthropogenic emissions and thus reflects ""current"" background levels at the sites analyzed. We further define global background O-3 (GBO(3)) as the sum of the global tropospheric and stratospheric components and find that higher modeled GBO(3) occurs during the spring at sites across the US. At many of the sites during the spring, fall, and winter months higher GBO(3) is associated with more frequent stratosphere-to-troposphere transport to the surface (SIT-S) events according to independent three-dimensional trajectories based on global meteorological analyses. Patterns of higher spring EIB O-3 are followed by lower values during the summer, due to heightened chemical interaction with anthropogenic sources, which are then followed by rising EIB O-3 during the fall and winter months. For some high-elevation western US sites, this seasonal pattern is less discernible due to relatively small anthropogenic contributions and the high EIB O-3 estimated throughout the year. EIB O-3 at all high-elevation sites contributes a significant proportion to total O-3 throughout the year and throughout the observed total O-3 frequency distribution, while EIB O-3 at most urban sites contributes a major portion to total O-3 during non-summer months and to the midrange concentrations (30-50 ppb) of the frequency distribution.

Tropospheric ozone levels have increased in spring at remote sites in the mid-latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere over the past few decades; this increase has been attributed to a growth in Asian precursor emissions. In contrast, 40 years of continuous measurements at Mauna Loa Observatory in Hawaii reveal little change in tropospheric ozone levels during spring (March-April), but a rise in autumn (September-October). Here we examine the contribution of decadal shifts in atmospheric circulation patterns to variability in tropospheric ozone levels at Mauna Loa using a suite of chemistry-climate model simulations. We show that the flow of ozone-rich air from Eurasia towards Hawaii during spring weakened in the 2000s as a result of La-Nina-like decadal cooling in the eastern equatorial Pacific Ocean. During autumn, in contrast, the flow of ozone-rich air from Eurasia to Hawaii strengthened in the mid-1990s onwards, coincident with the positive phase of the Pacific-North American pattern. We suggest that these shifts in atmospheric circulation patterns can reconcile observed trends in tropospheric ozone levels at Mauna Loa and the northern mid-latitudes in recent decades.

The National Emissions Inventory for NOx from area and mobile sources is projected from 2005 to 2012 and NOx from point sources is projected from 2010 to 2012, in which we find that NOx emissions from area, mobile and point sources reduce by 8.1%, 37.8% and 4.1%, respectively. The majority of the NOx emissions reduction occurs in megacities over the CONtiguous U.S. (CONUS), in which the spatial distribution pattern is generally supported by the NO2 column result retrieved from the GOME-2 satellite data. The CMAQ-predicted NOx and O-3 concentrations using updated NOx emissions were then compared to Air Quality System (AQS) ground observations in order to evaluate the updated NOx emissions inventory. The comparison showed an improvement in NOx and O-3 predictions over the CONUS. The NOx bias, in July 2011, for urban, suburban and rural land-use types was reduced by 234 ppb, 2.09 ppb and 0.57 ppb, respectively. Meanwhile, the O-3 bias is reduced by 0.92 ppb, 1.26 ppb and 1.87 ppb, respectively. However, problems remain in CMAQ for NOx and O-3 simulations despite undertaking this emissions adjustment. For example, the O-3 overestimation in CMAQ during the daytime over the CONUS decreases when the NOx underestimation increases, suggesting that in addition to the NOx emissions inventory, further study of VOC emissions, NOx chemical and physical mechanisms as well as meteorology parameters in the NAQFC is necessary.

These estimates rely on simulations with atmospheric chemistry-transport models that set North American anthropogenic emissions to zero, and to date have relied heavily on one global model. We examine NAB estimates for spring and summer 2006 with two independent global models (GEOS-Chem and GFDL AM3). We evaluate the base simulations, which include North American anthropogenic emissions, with mid-tropospheric O-3 retrieved from space and ground-level O-3 measurements. The models often bracket the observed values, implying value in developing a multi-model approach to estimate NAB O-3. Consistent with earlier studies, the models robustly simulate the largest nation-wide NAB levels at high-altitude western U.S. sites (seasonal average maximum daily 8-h values of similar to 40-50 ppb in spring and similar to 25 -40 ppb in summer) where it correlates with observed O-3. At these sites, a 27-year GFDL AM3 simulation simulates observed O-3 events above 60 ppb and indicates that year-to-year variations in NAB O-3 influence their annual frequency (with NAB contributing 50-60 ppb or more during individual events). During summer over the eastern United States (EUS), when photochemical production from regional anthropogenic emissions peaks, NAB is largely uncorrelated with observed values and it is lower than at high-altitude sites (average values of similar to 20-30 ppb). Four processes contribute substantially to model differences in specific regions and seasons: lightning NOx biogenic isoprene emissions and chemistry, wildfires, and stratosphere-to-troposphere transport. Differences in the representations of these processes within the GFDL AM3 and GEOS-Chem models contribute more to uncertainty in NAB estimates, particularly in spring when NAB is highest, than the choice of horizontal resolution within a single model (GEOS-Chem). We propose that future efforts seek to constrain these processes with targeted analysis of multi-model simulations evaluated with observations of O-3 and related species from multiple platforms, and thereby reduce the error on NAB estimates needed for air quality planning.

The environmental impacts of this development, from its effect on water quality to the influence of increased methane leakage on climate, have been a matter of intense debate. Air quality impacts are associated with emissions of nitrogen oxides (NOx = NO + NO2) and volatile organic compounds (VOCs), whose photochemistry leads to production of ozone, a secondary pollutant with negative health effects. Recent observations in oil- and gas-producing basins in the western United States have identified ozone mixing ratios well in excess of present air quality standards, but only during winter. Understanding winter ozone production in these regions is scientifically challenging. It occurs during cold periods of snow cover when meteorological inversions concentrate air pollutants from oil and gas activities, but when solar irradiance and absolute humidity, which are both required to initiate conventional photochemistry essential for ozone production, are at a minimum. Here, using data from a remote location in the oil and gas basin of northeastern Utah and a box model, we provide a quantitative assessment of the photochemistry that leads to these extreme winter ozone pollution events, and identify key factors that control ozone production in this unique environment. We find that ozone production occurs at lower NOx and much larger VOC concentrations than does its summertime urban counterpart, leading to carbonyl (oxygenated VOCs with a C = O moiety) photolysis as a dominant oxidant source. Extreme VOC concentrations optimize the ozone production efficiency of NOx. There is considerable potential for global growth in oil and gas extraction from shale. This analysis could help inform strategies to monitor and mitigate air quality impacts and provide broader insight into the response of winter ozone to primary pollutants.",0,0,1.4.1,Winter Ozone in Western Intermountain Basins

Day 1 exposures were either to filtered air, DE (300 ?g/m3), O3 (0.300 ppm), or the combination of both pollutants. On Day 2 all exposures were to O3 (0.300 ppm), and Day 3 served as a followup observation day.

Functional pulmonary responses to the pollutants were also characterized based on stratification by glutathione S-transferase mu 1 (GSTM1) genotype. On Day 1, exposure to air or DE did not change FEV1 or FVC in the subject population (n?=?15). The co-exposure to O3 and DE decreased FEV1 (17.6%) to a greater extent than O3 alone (9.9%). To test for synergistic exposure effects, i.e., in a greater than additive fashion, FEV1 changes post individual O3 and DE exposures were summed together and compared to the combined DE and O3 exposure; the p value was 0.057.

GSTM1 genotype did not affect the magnitude of lung function changes in a significant fashion. These data suggest that altered respiratory responses to the combination of O3 and DE exposure can be observed showing a greater than additive manner.

The two monitors were mounted in a wheeled, fan-cooled suitcase together with a battery, a disposable N2O cartridge for the model 211 monitor and filtered sample lines. A scripted technician made paired O3 measurements in a variety of MEs within 2 miles of a fixed-site FEM O3 photometer at the Durham National GuardArmory. The ratio of the 211 to Armory O3 concentrations tended to be lowest (&lt;0.3) for 45 indoor MEs and highest (&gt;0.8) for 104 outdoor MEs. The mean values of the ratio for in-vehicle MEs tended to fall between 0.2 and 0.7--the mean for all 27 in-car tests was 0.3. The ratio values for indoor MEs tended to be higher when the enclosure was well ventilated. The outdoor ratios tended to be lower when the measurement was made downwind of nearby roadways, likely due to exhaust NO. The in-vehicle ratios tended to be larger with windows open than closed; the smallest occurred with closed windows, active air conditioning, and vent recirculation. The 205 - 211 measurement differences were generally small, with 94% of the 176 sample differences below 5 ppb. Five differences were above 10 ppb with the largest values (173.9 and 63.6 ppb) occurring inside a violin repair shop. Roadway proximity tended to increase the differences for outdoor locations. The largest in-vehicle difference (6 ppb) occurred at a convenience store service station. As addressed in regulatory models, such differences may reduce estimated population O3 exposure by 30-50% in indoor and in-vehicle MEs where individuals spend more than 80% of their time.<br /><br /><strong>IMPLICATIONS: </strong>Computer models used to estimate exposures of human populations-such as the Air Pollution Exposure Model (APEX) developed by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency-can be improved by use of direct microenvironmental (ME) measurement comparisons to nearby fixed-site monitors used for determining regulatory compliance. Simultaneous measurements made by model 211 and model 205 ozone monitors in a variety of MEs indicated that Federal Equivalent Method photometers similar to the model 205 may read high in the presence of various interferences associated with indoor sources and motor vehicles, increasing modeled exposures in such environments by 20-100%.",0,0,2.4.2,Infiltration

In particular, many locations are preferentially chosen to capture high values of a response, for example, air pollution levels in environmental monitoring. Then, model estimation and prediction of the exposure surface become biased due to the selective sampling. Since prediction is often the main utility of the modeling, we suggest that the effect of preferential sampling lies more importantly in the resulting predictive surface than in parameter estimation. Our contribution is to offer a direct simulation-based approach to assessing the effects of preferential sampling. We compare two predictive surfaces over the study region, one originating from the notion of an 'operating' intensity driving the selection of monitoring sites, the other under complete spatial randomness. We can consider a range of response models. They may reflect the operating intensity, introduce alternative informative covariates, or just propose a flexible spatial model. Then, we can generate data under the given model. Upon fitting the model and interpolating (kriging), we will obtain two predictive surfaces to compare. It is important to note that we need suitable metrics to compare the surfaces and that the predictive surfaces are random, so we need to make expected comparisons.",0,0,2.3.2.1,Spatial Interpolation

Many studies of this nature relate outdoor pollution levels measured at a few monitoring stations with health outcomes. Recently, computational methods have been developed to model the distribution of personal exposures, rather than ambient concentration, and then relate the exposure distribution to the health outcome. Although these methods show great promise, they are limited by the computational demands of the exposure model. We propose a method to alleviate these computational burdens with the eventual goal of implementing a national study of the health effects of air pollution exposure. Our approach is to develop a statistical emulator for the exposure model, i.e. we use Bayesian density estimation to predict the conditional exposure distribution as a function of several variables, such as temperature, human activity and physical characteristics of the pollutant. This poses a challenging statistical problem because there are many predictors of the exposure distribution and density estimation is notoriously difficult in high dimensions. To overcome this challenge, we use stochastic search variable selection to identify a subset of the variables that have more than just additive effects on the mean of the exposure distribution.

Ozone concentration in this southeast Texas region frequently exceeds the National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS). For this reason our study employed the Weather Research and Forecasting model with Chemistry (WRF/Chem) to quantify meteorological prediction differences produced by four widely used PBL schemes and analyzed its impact on ozone predictions. The model results were compared to observational data in order to identify one superior PBL scheme better suited for the area. The four PBL schemes include two first-order closure schemes, the Yonsei University (YSU) and the Asymmetric Convective Model version 2 (ACM2); as well as two turbulent kinetic energy closure schemes, the Mellor-Yamada-Janjic (MYJ) and Quasi-Normal Scale Elimination (QNSE). Four 24 h forecasts were performed, one for each PBL scheme. Simulated vertical profiles for temperature, potential temperature, relative humidity, water vapor mixing ratio, and the u-v components of the wind were compared to measurements collected during the Second Texas Air Quality Study (TexAQS-II) Radical and Aerosol Measurements Project (TRAMP) experiment in summer 2006. Simulated ozone was compared against TRAMP data, and air quality stations from Continuous Monitoring Station (CAMS). Also, the evolutions of the PBL height and vertical mixing properties within the PBL for the four simulations were explored. Although the results yielded high correlation coefficients and small biases in almost all meteorological variables, the overall results did not indicate any preferred PBL scheme for the Houston case.

Using a regional photochemical model (CAMx), we ran a modeling episode with meteorological inputs simulating conditions as they occurred during August through September 2006 (a period representative of conditions leading to high ozone), and two emissions inventories (a 2006 base case and a 2018 proposed control scenario, both for Houston, Texas) at 36, 12, 4 and 2 km resolution. The base case model performance was evaluated for each resolution against daily maximum 8-h averaged ozone measured at monitoring stations. Results from each resolution were more similar to each other than they were to measured values. Population-weighted ozone concentrations were calculated for each resolution and applied to concentration response functions (with 95% confidence intervals) to estimate the health impacts of modeled ozone reduction from the base case to the control scenario. We found that estimated avoided mortalities were not significantly different between the 2, 4 and 12 km resolution runs, but the 36 km resolution may over-predict some potential health impacts. Given the cost/benefit analysis requirements motivated by Executive Order 12866 as it applies to the Clean Air Act, the uncertainty associated with human health impacts and therefore the results reported in this study, we conclude that health impacts calculated from population weighted ozone concentrations obtained using regional photochemical models at 36 km resolution fall within the range of values obtained using fine (12 km or finer) resolution modeling. However, in some cases, 36 km resolution may not be fine enough to statistically replicate the results achieved using 2, 4 or 12 km resolution. On average, when modeling at 36 km resolution, an estimated 5 deaths per week during the May through September ozone season are avoided because of ozone reductions resulting from the proposed emissions reductions (95% confidence interval was 2-8). When modeling at 2, 4 or 12 km finer scale resolution, on average 4 deaths are avoided due to the same reductions (95% confidence interval was 1-7). Study results show that ozone modeling at a resolution finer than 12 km is unlikely to reduce uncertainty in benefits analysis for this specific region. We suggest that 12 km resolution may be appropriate for uncertainty analyses of health impacts due to ozone control scenarios, in areas with similar chemistry, meteorology and population density, but that resolution requirements should be assessed on a case-by-case basis and revised as confidence intervals for concentration-response functions are updated.",0,0,2.3.2.3,Chemical Transport Modeling

Results: The AIC indicated that a model that assumed intra-subject variability was related to the magnitude of individual response fit the data better than a model that assumes intra-subject variability is constant across individuals and exposures (the original model). This finding was consistent with the variability of observed responses for filtered air exposures and for exposures predicted to be below the threshold for response.

Conclusion: An ozone exposure-response model that assumes intra-subject variability increases with individual mean FEV1 response appears to fit the data better than one that assumes constant variability.",0,0,3.1.4.1.1,Controlled Human Exposure Studies

Based on the human exposure experiment, the study first constructed the relationship between lung function decrement and respiratory symptoms scores (ranged 0-1 corresponding to absent to severe symptoms). This study used a toxicodynamic model to estimate different levels of ozone exposure concentration-associated lung function decrement measured as percent forced expiratory volume in 1 s (%FEV1). The relationships between 8-h ozone exposure and %FEV1 decrement were also constructed with a concentration-response model. The recorded time series of environmental monitoring of ozone concentrations in Taiwan were used to analyze the statistical indicators which may have predictability in ozone-induced airway function disorders. A statistical indicator-based probabilistic risk assessment framework was used to predict and assess the ozone-associated respiratory symptoms scores. The results showed that ozone-associated lung function decrement can be detected by using information from statistical indicators. The coefficient of variation and skewness were the common indicators which were highly correlated with %FEV1 decrement in the next 7 days. The model predictability can be further improved by a composite statistical indicator. There was a 50 % risk probability that mean and maximum respiratory symptoms scores would fall within the moderate region, 0.33-0.67, with estimates of 0.36 (95 % confidence interval 0.27-0.45) and 0.50 (0.41-0.59), respectively.

Distributions for air exchange rate in a subset of homes in Houston, Texas, were taken from the literature and combined with background ozone removal rates in typical houses and previous experimentally determined ozone deposition velocities to activated carbon cloth and gypsum wallboard PRMs. The median ratio of indoor to outdoor ozone was predicted to be 0.16 for homes with no PRMs installed and ranged from 0.047 to 0.12 for homes with PRMs. Median values of ozone removal effectiveness in these homes ranged from 22% to 68% for the conditions investigated. Achieving an ozone removal effectiveness above 50% in half of the homes would require installing a large area of PRMs and providing enhanced air speed to transport pollutants to PRM surfaces. Challenges associated with achieving this removal include optimizing indoor transport and aesthetic implications of large surface areas of PRM materials. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

The model captured well in the surface ozone and nitrogen dioxide concentrations for both summer and winter months. But it lacked skill in reproducing sulfur dioxide concentration, with significant overestimates in both summer and winter. The model underestimated weekly wet deposition of total Hg partly because of errors in precipitation from the meteorological model. The air quality model overestimated atmospheric ambient elemental Hg (GEM) concentration in summer and slightly underestimated it in winter. The model exhibited good skill in capturing seasonal variability of reactive gaseous mercury (GOM), while it produced a significant overestimate for particulate mercury (PBM) in both summer and winter. Sensitivity tests revealed that anthropogenic emissions had great influences on local/regional ambient concentrations of GEM, GOM, and PBM, with anthropogenic emissions, making a contribution of 10-20 % for ambient GEM, 20-40 % for GOM, and 40-60 % for PBM. The evident influence of anthropogenic sources on Hg concentration suggests that discrepancies between modeled and observed are partly attributable to the uncertainties associated with the anthropogenic emission inventory used in the air quality modeling system.

In this study, the Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) modeling system is further developed and improved by implementing 22 ammonia (NH3)/hydrogen sulfide (H2S) related gas-phase reactions and adjusting a few key parameters (e.g., emission potential) for bi-directional exchange of NH3 fluxes. Several simulations are conducted over the eastern U.S. domain at a 12-km horizontal resolution for January and July 2002 to examine the impacts of those improved treatments on air quality. The 5th generation mesoscale model (MM5) and CMAQ predict an overall satisfactory and consistent performance with previous modeling studies, especially for 2-m temperature, 2-m relative humidity, ozone (O-3), and fine particulate matter (PM2.5). High model biases exist for precipitation in July and also dry/wet depositions. The updated model treatments contribute to O-3, and PM2.5 by up to 0.4 ppb, 1.0 mu g m(-3), and 1.0 mu g m(-3) in January, respectively, and reduce O-3 by up to 0.8 ppb and contribute to NHx and PM2.5 by up to 1.2 and 1.1 mu g m(-3) in July, respectively. The spatial distributions of O-3 in both months and sulfur dioxide (SO2) in January are mainly affected by inline dry deposition velocity calculation. The spatial distributions of SO2 and sulfate (SO42-) in July are affected by both inline dry deposition velocity and NH3/H2S reactions. The variation trends of NH3, NHx, ammonium nitrate (NH4NO3), PM2.5 and total nitrogen (TN) are predominated by bi-directional exchange of NH3 fluxes. Uncertainties of NH3 emission potentials and empirical constants used in the bi-directional exchange scheme may significantly affect the concentrations of NH, and PM2.5, indicating that a more accurate and explicit treatment for those parameters should be considered in the future work.

Thorough comparison with several ground observation networks mostly over Europe and North America was conducted to evaluate the model performance as well as the ability of CMAQ to reproduce the observed trends in air quality over the past 2 decades in three regions: eastern China, the continental United States and Europe.
<br>
<br>The model successfully reproduced the observed decreasing trends in SO2, NO2, 8 h O-3 maxima, SO42- and elemental carbon (EC) in the US and Europe. However, the model fails to reproduce the decreasing trends in NO3- in the US, potentially pointing to uncertainties of NH3 emissions. The model failed to capture the 6-year trends of SO2 and NO2 in CN-API (China - Air Pollution Index) from 2005 to 2010, but reproduced the observed pattern of O-3 trends shown in three World Data Centre for Greenhouse Gases (WDCGG) sites over eastern Asia. Due to the coarse spatial resolution employed in these calculations, predicted SO2 and NO2 concentrations are underestimated relative to all urban networks, i.e., US-AQS (US - ir Quality System; normalized mean bias (NMB) D 38% and 48 %), EU-AIRBASE (European Air quality data Base; NMB D 18 and 54 %) and CN-API (NMB D 36 and 68 %). Conversely, at the rural network EU-EMEP (European Monitoring and Evaluation Programme), SO2 is overestimated (NMB from 4 to 150 %) while NO2 is simulated well (NMB within +/- 15 %) in all seasons. Correlations between simulated and observed O-3 wintertime daily 8 h maxima (DM8) are poor compared to other seasons for all networks. Better correlation between simulated and observed SO42- was found compared to that for SO2. Underestimation of summer SO42- in the US may be associated with the uncertainty in precipitation and associated wet scavenging representation in the model. The model exhibits worse performance for NO3- predictions, particularly in summer, due to high uncertainties in the gas/particle partitioning of NO3- as well as seasonal variations of NH3 emissions. There are high correlations (R &gt; 0.5) between observed and simulated EC, although the model underestimates the EC concentration by 65% due to the coarse grid resolution as well as uncertainties in the PM speciation profile associated with EC emissions.
<br>
<br>The almost linear response seen in the trajectory of modeled O-3 changes in eastern China over the past 2 decades suggests that control strategies that focus on combined control of NOx and volatile organic compound (VOC) emissions with a ratio of 0.46 may provide the most effective means for O-3 reductions for the region devoid of nonlinear response potentially associated with NOx or VOC limitation resulting from alternate strategies. The response of O-3 is more sensitive to changes in NOx emissions in the eastern US because the relative abundance of biogenic VOC emissions tends to reduce the effectiveness of VOC controls. Increasing NH3 levels offset the relative effectiveness of NOx controls in reducing the relative fraction of aerosol NO3- formed from declining NOx emissions in the eastern US, while the control effectiveness was assured by the simultaneous control of NH3 emission in Europe.",0,0,1.6.2,Advances in Regional Chemical Transport Modeling

In the winter, fifth percentile ozone concentrations generally increased by 0.1-1 ppb/yr.

Objective: We hypothesized that ozone exposure alters pulmonary and systemic vascular function, and cardiac function, with more pronounced effects in subjects with impaired antioxidant defense from deletion of the glutathione-S-transferase M1 gene (GSTM1 null).

Methods: Twenty-four young, healthy never-smoker subjects (12 GSTM1 null) inhaled filtered air, 100 ppb ozone and 200 ppb ozone for 3 h, with intermittent exercise, in a double-blind, randomized, crossover fashion. Exposures were separated by at least 2 weeks. Vital signs, spirometry, arterial and venous blood nitrite levels, impedance cardiography, peripheral arterial tonometry, estimation of pulmonary capillary blood volume (Vc), and blood microparticles and platelet activation were measured at baseline and during 4 h after each exposure.

Results: Ozone inhalation decreased lung function immediately after exposure (mean +/- standard error change in FEV1, air: -0.03 +/- 0.04 L; 200 ppb ozone: -0.30 +/- 0.07 L; p < 0.001).

The principal indoor source of O-3 is air exchange, while OH and NO3 formation are considered as primarily from O-3 reactions with alkenes and nitrogen dioxide (NO2), respectively. Herein, we used time-averaged models for residences to predict O-3, OH, and NO3 concentrations and their impacts on conversion of typical residential VOC profiles, within a Monte Carlo framework that varied inputs probabilistically. We accounted for established oxidant sources, as well as explored the importance of two newly realized indoor sources: (i). the photolysis of nitrous acid (HONO) indoors to generate OH and (ii) the reaction of stabilized Criegee intermediates (SCI) with NO2 to generate NO3. We found total VOC conversion to be dominated by reactions both with O-3, which almost solely reacted with D-limonene, and also with OH, which reacted with D-limonene, other terpenes, alcohols, aldehydes, and aromatics. VOC oxidation rates increased with air exchange, outdoor O-3, NO2 and D-limonene sources, and indoor photolysis rates; and they decreased with O-3 deposition and nitric oxide (NO) sources. Photolysis was a strong OH formation mechanism for high NO, NO2, and HONO settings, but SCI/NO2 reactions weakly generated NO3 except for only a few cases. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

This study uses a regional-scale air quality model (WRF-Chem) to simulate high ozone (O-3) episodes during the winter of 2013 over the Uinta Basin (UB) in northeastern Utah, which is densely populated by thousands of oil and NG wells. The high-resolution meteorological simulations are able qualitatively to reproduce the wintertime cold pool conditions that occurred in 2013, allowing the model to reproduce the observed multi-day buildup of atmospheric pollutants and the accompanying rapid photochemical ozone formation in the UB. Two different emission scenarios for the oil and NG sector were employed in this study. The first emission scenario (bottom-up) was based on the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) National Emission Inventory (NEI) (2011, version 1) for the oil and NG sector for the UB. The second emission scenario (top-down) was based on estimates of methane (CH4) emissions derived from in situ aircraft measurements and a regression analysis for multiple species relative to CH4 concentration measurements in the UB. Evaluation of the model results shows greater underestimates of CH4 and other volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in the simulation with the NEI-2011 inventory than in the case when the top-down emission scenario was used. Unlike VOCs, the NEI-2011 inventory significantly overestimates the emissions of nitrogen oxides (NOx), while the top-down emission scenario results in a moderate negative bias. The model simulation using the top-down emission case captures the buildup and afternoon peaks observed during high O-3 episodes. In contrast, the simulation using the bottom-up inventory is not able to reproduce any of the observed high O-3 concentrations in the UB. Simple emission reduction scenarios show that O-3 production is VOC sensitive and NOx insensitive within the UB. The model results show a disproportionate contribution of aromatic VOCs to O-3 formation relative to all other VOC emissions. The model analysis reveals that the major factors driving high wintertime O-3 in the UB are shallow boundary layers with light winds, high emissions of VOCs from oil and NG operations compared to NOx emissions, enhancement of photolysis fluxes and reduction of O-3 loss from deposition due to snow cover.",0,0,1.4.1,Winter Ozone in Western Intermountain Basins

Source-based apportionment techniques implemented in photochemical grid models track sources through the physical and chemical processes important to the formation and transport of air pollutants. Photochemical model source apportionment has been used to track source impacts of specific sources, groups of sources (sectors), sources in specific geographic areas, and stratospheric and lateral boundary inflow on O-3. The implementation and application of a source apportionment technique for O-3 and its precursors, nitrogen oxides (NOx) and volatile organic compounds (VOCs), for the Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) model are described here. The Integrated Source Apportionment Method (ISAM) O-3 approach is a hybrid of source apportionment and source sensitivity in that O-3 production is attributed to precursor sources based on O-3 formation regime (e.g., for a NOx-sensitive regime, O-3 is apportioned to participating NOx emissions). This implementation is illustrated by tracking multiple emissions source sectors and lateral boundary inflow. NOx, VOC, and O-3 attribution to tracked sectors in the application are consistent with spatial and temporal patterns of precursor emissions. The O-3 ISAM implementation is further evaluated through comparisons of apportioned ambient concentrations and deposition amounts with those derived from brute force zero-out scenarios, with correlation coefficients ranging between 0.58 and 0.99 depending on specific combination of target species and tracked precursor emissions. Low correlation coefficients occur for chemical regimes that have strong nonlinearity in O-3 sensitivity, which demonstrates different functionalities between source apportionment and zero-out approaches, where appropriate use depends on whether source attribution or source sensitivity is desired.",0,0,1.8.1.2,Source Apportionment Approaches

Fire emissions were simulated using the BlueSky framework with fire locations determined by the Satellite Mapping Automated Reanalysis Tool for Fire Incident Reconciliation (SMART-FIRE). Plume rise was simulated using two different methods: the Fire Emission Production Simulator (FEPS) and the Sparse Matrix Operator Kernel Emissions (SMOKE) model. Predicted plume top heights were compared to the Cloud-Aerosol LIDAR with Orthogonal Polarization (CALIOP) instrument aboard the Cloud Aerosol LIDAR and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observation (CALIPSO) satellite.

The AIRPACT-3 model captured the location and transport direction of fire events well, but sometimes missed the timing of fire events and overall underestimated the PM2.5 impact of wildfire events at surface monitor locations. During the 2007 (2008) fire period, the fractional biases (FBs) of AIRPACT-3 for various pollutant observations included: average 24 h PM2.5 FB=-33% (-27 %); maximum daily average 8 h ozone FB=-8% (+1 %); AOD FB=-61% (-53%); total column CO FB=-10%(-5%); and tropospheric column NO2 FB=-39% (-28%). The bias in total column CO is within the range of expected error. Fractional biases of AIRPACT-3 plume tops were found to be -46% when compared in terms of above mean sea level, but only -28% when compared in terms of above ground level, partly due to the underestimation of AIRPACT-3 ground height in complex terrain that results from the 12 km grid-cell smoothing. We conclude that aerosol predictions were too low for locations greater than similar to 100-300 km downwind from wildfire sources and that model predictions are likely under-predicting secondary organic aerosol (SOA) production, due to a combination of very low volatile organic compound (VOC) emission factors used in the United States Forest Service Consume model, an incomplete speciation of VOC to SOA precursors in SMOKE, and under-prediction by the SOA parameterization within CMAQ.",0,0,2.8,Evidence Inventories?????Data Tables to Provide Supporting Information

Model results for the summers of 2002 and 2005 were compared to simulations from a previous version of CMAQ to assess the impact of model updates on predicted pollutant response. Changes to the model treatment of emissions, meteorology and chemistry had substantial impacts on the simulated ozone concentrations. While the median bias for high summertime ozone decreased in both years compared to previous simulations, the observed decrease in ozone from 2002 to 2005 in the eastern US continued to be underestimated by the model. Additional ""cross"" simulations were used to decompose the model predicted change in ozone into the change due to emissions, the change due to meteorology and any remaining change not explained individually by these two components. The decomposition showed that the emission controls led to a decrease in modeled high summertime ozone close to twice as large as the decrease attributable to changes in meteorology alone.

Over polluted regions, regional NOx largely controls the shape of surface O-3 seasonal cycles. In the absence of regional NOx controls, climate warming contributes to a higher surface O-3 summertime peak over the NE. A doubling of the global CH4 abundance by 2100 partially offsets summertime surface O-3 decreases attained via NOx reductions and contributes to raising surface O-3 during December-March when the O-3 lifetime is longer.

We reduce this range in emission estimates, and present a top-down soil NOx emission inventory for 2005 based on retrieved tropospheric NO2 columns from the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI). We use a state-of-science soil NOx emission inventory (Hudman et al., 2012) as a priori in the GEOS-Chem chemistry transport model to identify 11 regions where tropospheric NO2 columns are dominated by soil NOx emissions. Strong correlations between soil NOx emissions and simulated NO2 columns indicate that spatial patterns in simulated NO2 columns in these regions indeed reflect the underlying soil NOx emissions. Subsequently, we use a mass-balance approach to constrain emissions for these 11 regions on all major continents using OMI observed and GEOS-Chem simulated tropospheric NO2 columns. We find that responses of simulated NO2 columns to changing NOx emissions are suppressed over low NOx regions, and account for these non-linearities in our inversion approach. In general, our approach suggests that emissions need to be increased in most regions. Our OMI top-down soil NOx inventory amounts to 10.0 TgN for 2005 when only constraining the 11 regions, and 12.9 TgN when extrapolating the constraints globally. Substantial regional differences exist (ranging from -40% to +90 %), and globally our top-down inventory is 4-35% higher than the GEOS-Chem a priori (9.6 TgNyr(-1)). We evaluate NO2 concentrations simulated with our new OMI top-down inventory against surface NO2 measurements from monitoring stations in Africa, the USA and Europe. Although this comparison is complicated by several factors, we find an encouraging improved agreement when using the OMI top-down inventory compared to using the a priori inventory. To our knowledge, this study provides, for the first time, specific constraints on soil NOx emissions on all major continents using OMI NO2 columns. Our results rule out the low end of reported soil NOx emission estimates, and suggest that global emissions are most likely around 12.9 +/- 3.9 Tg N yr(-1).",0,0,1.3.1.3.1,Biogenic Nitrogen Oxide Emissions: Fertilized Soils

Past studies have separately used satellite-observed clouds to correct the model-predicted photolysis rates, or satellite-constrained top-down NOx emissions to identify and reduce uncertainties in bottom-up NOx emissions. However, the joint application of multiple satellite-derived model inputs to improve O-3 state implementation plan (SIP) modeling has rarely been explored. In this study, Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES) observations of clouds are applied to derive the photolysis rates, replacing those used in Texas SIP modeling. This changes modeled O-3 concentrations by up to 80 ppb and improves O-3 simulations by reducing modeled normalized mean bias (NMB) and normalized mean error (NME) by up to 0.1. A sector-based discrete Kalman filter (DKF) inversion approach is incorporated with the Comprehensive Air Quality Model with extensions (CAMx)-decoupled direct method (DDM) model to adjust Texas NOx emissions using a high-resolution Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) NO2 product. The discrepancy between OMI and CAMx NO2 vertical column densities (VCDs) is further reduced by increasing modeled NOx lifetime and adding an artificial amount of NO2 in the upper troposphere. The region-based DKF inversion suggests increasing NOx emissions by 10-50% in most regions, deteriorating the model performance in predicting ground NO2 and O-3, while the sector-based DKF inversion tends to scale down area and nonroad NOx emissions by 50 %, leading to a 2-5 ppb decrease in ground 8 h O-3 predictions. Model performance in simulating ground NO2 and O-3 are improved using sector-based inversion-constrained NOx emissions, with 0.25 and 0.04 reductions in NMBs and 0.13 and 0.04 reductions in NMEs, respectively. Using both GOES-derived photolysis rates and OMI-constrained NOx emissions together reduces modeled NMB and NME by 0.05, increases the model correlation with ground measurement in O-3 simulations, and makes O-3 more sensitive to NOx emissions in the O-3 non-attainment areas.",0,0,2.8,Evidence Inventories?????Data Tables to Provide Supporting Information

The first approach is a direct sensitivity modeling approach that considers the ozone levels that would remain after certain emissions are entirely removed (i.e., zero-out modeling). The second approach is based on an instrumented air quality model which tracks the formation of ozone within the simulation and assigns the source of that ozone to pre-identified categories (i.e., source apportionment modeling). This analysis focuses on a definition of background referred to as U.S. background (USB) which is designed to represent the influence of all sources other than U.S. anthropogenic emissions. Two separate modeling simulations were completed for an April October 2007 period, both focused on isolating the influence of sources other than domestic manmade emissions. The zero-out modeling was conducted with the Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) model and the source apportionment modeling was completed with the Comprehensive Air Quality Model with Extensions (CAMx). Our analysis shows that the zero-out and source apportionment techniques provide relatively similar estimates of the magnitude of seasonal mean daily 8-h maximum U.S. background ozone at locations in the western U.S. when base case model ozone biases are considered. The largest differences between the two sets of USB estimates occur in urban areas where interactions with local NOx emissions can be important, especially when ozone levels are relatively low. Both methodologies conclude that seasonal mean daily 8-h maximum U.S. background ozone levels can be as high as 40 -45 ppb over rural portions of the western U.S. Background fractions tend to decrease as modeled total ozone concentrations increase, with typical fractions of 75-100 percent on the lowest ozone days (<25 ppb) and typical fractions between 30 and 50% on days with ozone above 75 ppb. The finding that estimates of background ozone are not strongly dependent on the technique applied lends credibility to this and earlier modeling work.

Consequently, NO2 levels have decreased by 30-40% in the last decade. We quantify NO2 trends (2005 -2013) over the U.S. using surface measurements from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Air Quality System (AQS) and an improved tropospheric NO2 vertical column density (VCD) data product from the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) on the Aura satellite. We demonstrate that the current OMI NO2 algorithm is of sufficient maturity to allow a favorable correspondence of trends and variations in OMI and AQS data. Our trend model accounts for the non-linear dependence of NO2 concentration on emissions associated with the seasonal variation of the chemical lifetime, including the change in the amplitude of the seasonal cycle associated with the significant change in NOx emissions that occurred over the last decade. The direct relationship between observations and emissions becomes more robust when one accounts for these non-linear dependencies. We improve the OMI NO2 standard retrieval algorithm and, subsequently, the data product by using monthly vertical concentration profiles, a required algorithm input, from a high-resolution chemistry and transport model (CTM) simulation with varying emissions (2005-2013). The impact of neglecting the time-dependence of the profiles leads to errors in trend estimation, particularly in regions where emissions have changed substantially. For example, trends calculated from retrievals based on time-dependent profiles offer 18% more instances of significant trends and up to 15% larger total NO2 reduction versus the results based on profiles for 2005. Using a CTM, we explore the theoretical relation of the trends estimated from NO2 VCDs to those estimated from ground-level concentrations. The model-simulated trends in VCDs strongly correlate with those estimated from surface concentrations (r = 0.83, N = 355). We then explore the observed correspondence of trends estimated from OMI and AQS data. We find a significant, but slightly weaker, correspondence (i.e., r = 0.68, N = 208) than predicted by the model and discuss some of the important factors affecting the relationship, including known problems (e.g., NOz interferents) associated with the AQS data. This significant correspondence gives confidence in trend and surface concentration estimates from OMI VCDs for locations, such as the majority of the U.S. and globe, that are not covered by surface monitoring networks. Using our improved trend model and our enhanced OMI data product, we find that both OMI and AQS data show substantial downward trends from 2005 to 2013, with an average reduction of 38% for each over the U.S. The annual reduction rates inferred from OMI and AQS measurements are larger (-4.8 +/- 1.9%/yr, -3.7 +/- 1.5%/yr) from 2005 to 2008 than 2010 to 2013 (-1.2 +/- 1.2%/yr, -2.1 +/- 1.4%/yr). We quantify NO2 trends for major U.S. cities and power plants; the latter suggest larger negative trend (-4.0 +/- 1.5%/yr) between 2005 and 2008 and smaller or insignificant changes (-0.5 +/- 1.2%/yr) during 2010-2013.

However, the emissions of ozone precursors from wildfires, and the mechanisms involved in ozone production from boreal fires, are very complicated. Moreover, an evaluation of the role of forest fires is prevented by the lack of direct observations of the ozone precursor, nitrogen oxides (NOx), and large uncertainties exist in the emissions inventories currently used for modelling. Acomprehensive understanding of the important processes and factors involving wildfires has thus been unobtainable. Wemade 16 year consistent analyses ofNOx emissions from boreal wildfires by using satellite observations of tropospheric nitrogen dioxides (NO2) from 1996 to 2011. Wereport substantial interannual variability of troposphericNO(2) originating from large boreal fires over Siberia in 1998, 2002, 2003, 2006, and 2008; and over Alaska in 2004, 2005, and 2009. Monthly comparisons ofNO2 enhancements with fire radiative power (FRP) show reasonably strong correlation, suggesting that FRP is a better proxy than burned area for boreal fireNOx emissions. Weprovide space-based constraints onNOx emission factors (EFs) for Siberian and Alaskan fires.

To design mitigation strategies for air pollution, 3D Chemistry Transport Models (CTMs) have been developed to support the decision process. Increases in model resolution may provide more accurate and detailed information, but will cubically increase computational costs and pose additional challenges concerning high resolution input data. The motivation for the present study was therefore to explore the impact of using finer horizontal grid resolution for policy support applications of the European Monitoring and Evaluation Programme (EMEP) model within the Long Range Transboundary Air Pollution (LRTAP) convention. The goal was to determine the ""optimum resolution"" at which additional computational efforts do not provide increased model performance using presently available input data. Five regional CTMs performed four runs for 2009 over Europe at different horizontal resolutions.
<br>
<br>The models' responses to an increase in resolution are broadly consistent for all models. The largest response was found for NO2 followed by PM10 and O-3. Model resolution does not impact model performance for rural background conditions. However, increasing model resolution improves the model performance at stations in and near large conglomerations. The statistical evaluation showed that the increased resolution better reproduces the spatial gradients in pollution regimes, but does not help to improve significantly the model performance for reproducing observed temporal variability. This study clearly shows that increasing model resolution is advantageous, and that leaving a resolution of 50 km in favour of a resolution between 10 and 20 km is practical and worthwhile. As about 70% of the model response to grid resolution is determined by the difference in the spatial emission distribution, improved emission allocation procedures at high spatial and temporal resolution are a crucial factor for further model resolution improvements.

We employ the 2005 US National Emissions Inventory, the Regional Atmospheric Chemistry Mechanism (RACM), and the Modal Aerosol Dynamics Model for Europe (MADE) with a volatility basis set (VBS) secondary aerosol module. Overall, model performance is comparable to contemporary modeling efforts used for regulatory and health-effects analysis, with an annual average daytime ozone (O-3) mean fractional bias (MFB) of 12% and an annual average fine particulate matter (PM2.5) MFB of 1 %. WRF-Chem, as configured here, tends to overpredict total PM2.5 at some high concentration locations and generally overpredicts average 24 h O-3 concentrations. Performance is better at predicting daytime-average and daily peak O-3 concentrations, which are more relevant for regulatory and health effects analyses relative to annual average values. Predictive performance for PM2.5 subspecies is mixed: the model overpredicts particulate sulfate (MFB = 36 %), underpredicts particulate nitrate (MFB = 110 %) and organic carbon (MFB = 29 %), and relatively accurately predicts particulate ammonium (MFB = 3 %) and elemental carbon (MFB = 3 %), so that the accuracy in total PM2.5 predictions is to some extent a function of offsetting over-and underpredictions of PM2.5 subspecies.

We find that anthropogenic interferences (or anthropogenic isoprene) contribute on average 22% of the PTR-MS m/z 69 signal during summer daytime, whereas MVK+MACR interferences (m/z 71) are minor (7%). After removing these interferences, the observed isoprene and MVK+MACR abundances show pronounced seasonal cycles, reaching summertime maxima of >2500 pptv (1h mean). The tall tower is impacted both by nearby and more distant regional isoprene sources, with daytime enhancements of isoprene (but little MVK+MACR) under southwest winds and enhancements of MVK+MACR (but little isoprene) at other times. We find that the GEOS-Chem atmospheric model with the MEGANv2.1 (Model of Emissions of Gases and Aerosols from Nature version 2.1) biogenic inventory can reproduce the isoprene observations to within model uncertainty given improved land cover and temperature estimates. However, a 60% low model bias in MVK+MACR cannot be resolved, even across diverse model assumptions for NOx emissions, chemistry, atmospheric mixing, dry deposition, land cover, and potential measurement interferences. This implies that, while isoprene emissions in the immediate vicinity of the tall tower are adequately captured, they are underestimated across the broader region. We show that this region experiences a strong seasonal shift between VOC-limited chemistry during the spring and fall and NOx-limited or transitional chemistry during the summer, driven by the spatiotemporal distribution of isoprene emissions. Isoprenes role in causing these chemical shifts is likely underestimated due to the underprediction of its regional emissions.",0,0,1.3.1.3.2,Biogenic Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs)

Operational evaluation shows that model performance is comparable to earlier annual applications of the uncoupled WRF/CMAQ modeling system Results also indicate that factors such as changes in the underlying emissions inventory and chemical boundary conditions likely exert a larger influence on overall model performance than feedback effects. A comparison of the simulated Aerosol Optical Depth (ACID) against observations reveals a tendency toward underprediction in all seasons despite a general overprediction of PM2.5 during wintertime. Summertime sensitivity simulations without feedback effects are used to quantify the average impact of the simulated direct feedback effect on temperature, PBL heights, ozone and PM2.5 concentrations. Model results for 2006 and 2010 are analyzed to compare modeled changes between these years to those seen in observations. The results for summertime average daily maximum 8-h ozone showed that the model tends to underestimate the observed decrease in concentrations. The results for total and speciated PM2.5 vary between seasons, networks and species, but the WRF CMAQ simulations do capture the substantial decreases in observed PM2.5 concentrations in summer and fall. These 2010-2006 PM2.5 decreases result in simulated increases of summer mean clear-sky shortwave radiation between 5 and 10 W/m(2). The WRF-CMAQ configuration without direct feedback effects simulates smaller changes in summertime PM2.5 concentrations, indicating that the direct feedback effect enhances the air quality benefits arising from emission controls and that coupled modeling systems are necessary to quantify such feedback effects.

Predicted daytime isoprene concentrations at nine surface sites operated by the Texas Commission of Environmental Quality (TCEQ) were significantly higher than local observations when biogenic emissions dominate the total isoprene concentrations, with mean normalized bias (MNB) ranges from 2.0 to 7.7 and mean normalized error (MNE) ranges from 2.2 to 7.7. Predicted upper air isoprene and its first generation oxidation products of methacrolein (MACR) and methyl vinyl ketone (MVK) were also significantly higher (MNB = 8.6, MNE = 9.1) than observations made onboard of NOAA's WP-3 airplane, which flew over the urban area. Over-prediction of isoprene and its oxidation products both at the surface and the upper air strongly suggests that biogenic isoprene emissions in the Houston area are significantly overestimated. Reducing the emission rates by approximately 3/4 was necessary to reduce the error between predictions and observations. Comparison of gridded leaf area index (LAI), plant functional type (PFT) and gridded isoprene emission factor (EF) used in MEGAN modeling with estimates of the same factors from a field survey north of downtown Houston showed that the isoprene over-prediction is likely caused by the combined effects of a large overestimation of the gridded EF in urban Houston and an underestimation of urban Lied. Nevertheless, predicted ozone concentrations in this region were not significantly affected by the isoprene over-predictions, while predicted isoprene SOA and total SOA concentrations can be higher by as much as 50% and 13% using the higher isoprene emission rates, respectively.

Personal exposure to PM2.5 and its elemental composition, however, may vary from stationary outdoor measurements. Here, we use concurrent indoor, outdoor, and personal sampling of PM2.5 and its elemental constituents along with personal and home characteristics, collected as a part of the Relationships of Indoor, Outdoor, and Personal Air (RIOPA) study to characterize the differences in PM2.5 among indoor, outdoor, and personal air samples. We found that personal exposure to PM2.5 and most elements were significantly correlated with, though frequently exceeded, both indoor and outdoor measurements. Principal component scores were used to determine that the mixture of elemental components in PM2.5 varies significantly across indoor, outdoor, and personal sample types. Using model-based clustering, we identified 7 clusters of RIOPA participants whose personal PM2.5 samples had similar patterns of elemental composition. Using this approach, two subsets of RIOPA participants were identified whose personal exposure to PM2.5 and elemental concentrations were significantly increased compared to both their indoor and outdoor levels.

This study conducts modeling experiments to investigate the impact of using different modeling configurations on various policy-related modeling outcomes. Two widely used chemical transport models with different meteorological data, biogenic emissions, and aerosol modeling schemes are applied to an annual modeling period, and model performance for ozone and particulate matter (PM) constituents is evaluated for different timescales and geographical regions in the US. Results show that while both models can be considered acceptable based on criteria commonly used by modelers when evaluated on the annual basis, the model performance at finer levels can reveal differences between the two modeling configurations, which may lead to different policy outcomes. Model results for 2005 and 2014 are used to determine monitoring sites projected to violate current US standards for ozone and fine PM, sites significantly affected by emissions from two selected upwind states, and ratios of deposition to ambient concentration of oxides of sulfur and nitrogen, a.k.a. transference ratios, at each monitoring site in the eastern US. The two modeling configurations result in quite different lists of sites and transference ratios even though both show acceptable model performance in the conventional model performance evaluation. This calls for development of model performance evaluation criteria specific to various regulatory purposes. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Following the Part 1 paper that focuses on the evaluation of the 2006 simulations, this Part 2 paper focuses on a comparison of model performance in 2006 and 2010 as well as analysis of the responses of air quality and meteorology-chemistry interactions to changes in emissions and meteorology from 2006 to 2010. In general, emissions for gaseous and aerosol species decrease from 2006 to 2010, leading to a reduction in gaseous and aerosol concentrations and associated changes in radiation and cloud variables due to various feedback mechanisms. WRF/Chem is able to reproduce most observations and the observed variation trends from 2006 to 2010, despite its slightly worse performance than WRF that is likely due to inaccurate chemistry feedbacks resulting from less accurate emissions and chemical boundary conditions (BCONs) in 2010. Compared to 2006, the performance for most meteorological variables in 2010 gives lower normalized mean biases but higher normalized mean errors and lower correlation coefficients. The model also shows poorer performance for most chemical variables in 2010. This could be attributed to underestimations in emissions of some species, such as primary organic aerosol in some areas of the US in 2010, and inaccurate chemical BCONs and meteorological predictions. The inclusion of chemical feedbacks in WRF/Chem reduces biases in meteorological predictions in 2010; however, it increases errors and weakens correlations comparing to WRF simulations. Sensitivity simulations show that the net changes in meteorological variables from 2006 to 2010 are mostly influenced by changes in meteorology and those of ozone and fine particulate matter are influenced to a large extent by emissions and/or chemical BCONs and to a lesser extent by changes in meteorology. Using a different set of emissions and/or chemical BCONs helps improve the performance of individual variables, although it does not improve the degree of agreement with observed interannual trends. These results indicate a need to further improve the accuracy and consistency of emissions and chemical BCONs, the representations of SOA and chemistry-meteorology feedbacks in the online-coupled models.",0,0,1.6.2,Advances in Regional Chemical Transport Modeling

It is ubiquitous in the atmosphere, central to tropospheric oxidation chemistry, yet harmful to human and ecosystem health as well as being an important greenhouse gas. It is not emitted into the atmosphere but is a byproduct of the very oxidation chemistry it largely initiates. Much effort is focused on the reduction of surface levels of ozone owing to its health and vegetation impacts, but recent efforts to achieve reductions in exposure at a country scale have proved difficult to achieve owing to increases in background ozone at the zonal hemispheric scale. There is also a growing realisation that the role of ozone as a short-lived climate pollutant could be important in integrated air quality climate change mitigation. This review examines current understanding of the processes regulating tropospheric ozone at global to local scales from both measurements and models. It takes the view that knowledge across the scales is important for dealing with air quality and climate change in a synergistic manner. The review shows that there remain a number of clear challenges for ozone such as explaining surface trends, incorporating new chemical understanding, ozone-climate coupling, and a better assessment of impacts. There is a clear and present need to treat ozone across the range of scales, a transboundary issue, but with an emphasis on the hemispheric scales.

At the same time, the operating costs of HVAC systems are often a large percentage of the total energy consumption of buildings, which constitutes 40% of the primary energy consumed in the U.S. As efforts are pursued to reduce building energy use, which may involve reductions in outdoor air ventilation rates, it is important to consider the impacts of these measures on IAQ, To better understand the IAQ and energy trade-offs of various ventilation approaches, simulations were performed using the multizone airflow model, CONTAM, for a big box retail store in two climates. Annual energy simulations were also performed in EnergyPlus. Simulations included ventilating at the minimum outdoor airflow rate prescribed by the ASHRAE Standard 62.1-2013 Ventilation Rate Procedure during occupied hours and at a lower rate for 24 h a day. Additional cases included increasing the base outdoor air intake rates and changing the building envelope airtightness. Annual airflow and contaminant (carbon dioxide, formaldehyde, ozone, particulate matter, and a generic volatile organic compound) simulations were performed using emission rates from previous studies of retail buildings. This study demonstrated that ventilating at a lower rate for 24 h a day saved energy compared with ventilating at the higher rate prescribed in ASHRAE 62.1 and that the simulated indoor contaminant concentrations did not exceed common benchmarks or health guidelines.

Indoor ozone originates mainly from the outdoor environment and enters a building through three different ventilation mechanism: infiltration, natural ventilation, and mechanical ventilation.

The ventilation rate was determined by using the decay method with sulfur hexafluoride (SF6) as a tracer gas. The surface removal rates were estimated from the information provided in the previous literature. The results show that within the range of our investigation, the indoor/outdoor ozone concentration ratio can be predicted by a simple steady-state model within 80% accuracy.

Current atmospheric satellite instruments cannot peer through the optically thick stratospheric ozone layer to remotely sense boundary layer tropospheric ozone. In order to monitor this lower ozone more effectively, the Tropospheric Ozone Lidar Network (TOLNet) has been developed, which currently consists of five stations across the US. The GSFC TROPOZ DIAL is based on the DIAL technique, which currently detects two wavelengths, 289 and 299 nm, with multiple receivers. The transmitted wavelengths are generated by focusing the output of a quadrupled Nd:YAG laser beam (266 nm) into a pair of Raman cells, filled with high-pressure hydrogen and deuterium, using helium as buffer gas. With the knowledge of the ozone absorption coefficient at these two wavelengths, the range-resolved number density can be derived. An interesting atmospheric case study involving the stratospheric-tropospheric exchange (STE) of ozone is shown, to emphasize the regional importance of this instrument as well as to assess the validation and calibration of data. There was a low amount of aerosol aloft, and an iterative aerosol correction has been performed on the retrieved data, which resulted in less than a 3 ppb correction to the final ozone concentration. The retrieval yields an uncertainty of 16-19% from 0 to 1.5 km, 10-18% from 1.5 to 3 km, and 11-25% from 3 to 12 km according to the relevant aerosol concentration aloft.

Secondary goals included the characterization of local ozone production, regional transport from the Los Angeles Basin, and impacts from wildfires. The LVOS measurement campaign took place at a former U.S. Air Force radar station similar to 45 km northwest of Las Vegas on Angel Peak (similar to 2.7 km above mean sea level, asl) in the Spring Mountains. The study consisted of two extended periods (May 19-June 4 and June 22-28, 2013) with near daily 5-min averaged lidar measurements of ozone and backscatter profiles from the surface to similar to 2.5 km above ground level (similar to 5.2 km asl), and continuous in situ measurements (May 20-June 28) of O-3, CO, (1-min) and meteorological parameters (5-min) at the surface. These activities were guided by forecasts and analyses from the FLEXPART (FLEXible PARTticle) dispersion model and the Real Time Air Quality Modeling System (RAQMS), and the NOAA Geophysical Research Laboratory (NOAA GFDL) AM3 chemistry-climate model. In this paper, we describe the LVOS measurements and present an overview of the results. The combined measurements and model analyses show that STT directly contributed to each of the three O-3 exceedances that occurred in Clark County during LVOS, with contributions to 8-h surface concentrations in excess of 30 ppbv on each of these days. The analyses show that long-range transport from Asia made smaller contributions (<10 ppbv) to surface O-3 during two of those exceedances. The contribution of regional wildfires to surface O-3 during the three LVOS exceedance events was found to be negligible, but wildfires were found to be a major factor during exceedance events that occurred before and after the LVOS campaign. Our analyses also shows that ozone exceedances would have occurred on more than 50% of the days during the six-week LVOS campaign if the 8-h ozone NAAQS had been 65 ppbv instead of 75 ppbv.

Simulations were conducted under idealized meteorological conditions, and the results are representative of mean boundary layer concentrations. Three sets of meteorological conditions winter, spring/autumn and summer - were used to capture the annual variability, similar to the 3-D model simulations in AQMEII Phase 2. We also employed the same emissions input data used in the 3-D model intercomparison, and sample from these datasets employing different strategies to evaluate mechanism performance under a realistic range of pollution conditions. Box model simulations using the different mechanisms are conducted with tight constraints on all relevant processes and boundary conditions (photolysis, temperature, entrainment, etc.) to ensure that differences in predicted concentrations of pollutants can be attributed to differences in the formulation of gas-phase chemistry. The results are then compared with each other (but not to measurements), leading to an understanding of mechanism-specific biases compared to the multi-model mean. Our results allow us to quantify the uncertainty in predictions of a given compound in the 3-D simulations introduced by the choice of gas-phase mechanisms, to determine mechanism-specific biases under certain pollution conditions, and to identify (or rule out) the gas-phase mechanism as the cause of an observed discrepancy in 3-D model predictions. We find that the predictions of the median diurnal cycle of O-3 over a set of emission conditions representing a network of station observations is within 4 ppbv (5%) across the different mechanisms. This variability is found to be very similar on both continents. There are considerably larger differences in predicted concentrations of NOx (up to +/- 25%), key radicals like OH (40%), HO2 (25%) and especially NO3 (>100%). Secondary substances like H2O2 (25%) or HNO3 (10%), as well as key volatile organic compounds like isoprene (>100%) or CH2O (20%) differ substantially as well. Calculation of an indicator of the chemical regime leads to up to 20% of simulations being classified differently by different mechanism, which would lead to different predictions of the most efficient emission reduction strategies. All these differences are despite identical meteorological boundary conditions, photolysis rates, as well as identical biogenic and inorganic anthropogenic emissions. Anthropogenic VOC emissions only vary in the way they are translated in mechanism-specific compounds, but are identical in the total emitted carbon mass and its spatial distribution. Our findings highlight that the choice of gas-phase mechanism is crucial in simulations for regulatory purposes, emission scenarios, as well as process studies that investigate other components like secondary formed aerosol components. We find that biogenic VOCs create considerable variability in mechanism predictions and suggest that these, together with nighttime chemistry should be areas of further mechanism improvement.

With the advent of online-coupled models providing new capability to quantify the effects of feedback processes, the main aim of this study is to compare the response of coupled air quality models to simulate levels of O-3 over the two continental regions. The simulated annual, seasonal, continental and sub-regional ozone surface concentrations and vertical profiles for the year 2010 have been evaluated against a large observational database from different measurement networks operating in Europe and North America. Results show a general model underestimation of the annual surface ozone levels over both continents reaching up to 18% over Europe and 22% over North America. The observed temporal variations are successfully reproduced with correlation coefficients larger than 0.8. Results clearly show that the simulated levels highly depend on the meteorological and chemical configurations used in the models, even within the same modeling system. The seasonal and sub-regional analyses show the models tendency to overestimate surface ozone in all regions during autumn and underestimate in winter. Boundary conditions strongly influence ozone predictions especially during winter and autumn, whereas during summer local production dominates over regional transport. Daily maximum 8-h averaged surface ozone levels below 50-60 mu g m(-3) are overestimated by all models over both continents while levels over 120-140 mu g m(-3) are underestimated, suggesting that models have a tendency to severely under-predict high O-3 values that are of concern for air quality forecast and control policy applications.

These trends are consistent with reported positive trends in springtime O-3 in the western U.S. In contrast median CO decreased by -3.1 +/- 2.4 ppbv yr(-1) (-1.9 +/- 1.4% yr(-1)), which is highly similar to springtime North Pacific surface flask measurements from 2004 to 2012. While a 10-year record is relatively short to evaluate long-term variability, we incorporate transport model analysis and contextualize our measurements with reported northern mid-latitude trends over similar time frames to investigate the causes of increasing O-3 and decreasing CO at MBO. We performed cluster analysis of 10-day HYSPLIT back-trajectories from MBO and examined O-3 and CO trends within each cluster. Significant positive O-3 trends were associated with high-altitude, rapid transport from East Asia. Significant negative CO trends were most associated with transport from the North Pacific and Siberia, as well as from East Asia. The rise in springtime O-3 is likely associated with increasing O-3 precursor emissions in Asia and long-range transport to the western U.S. The decline in springtime CO appears linked to decreasing Northern Hemisphere background CO, largely due to anthropogenic emissions reductions in Europe and North America, and also to a recently reported decline in total CO output from China caused by more efficient combustion. These springtime O-3 and CO trends suggest that hydroxyl radical (OH) mixing ratios in the North Pacific may have increased over the study period. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

However, recent satellite-based studies over tropical and subtropical regions have indicated spatio-temporal variations in EFs within specific biomes. In this study, satellite measurements of tropospheric NO2 vertical columns (TVC NO2) from the GOME-2 instrument and fire radiative power (FRP) from MODIS are used for the estimation of fire emission rates (FERs) of NOx over Eurasian and North American boreal forests. The retrieval of TVC NO2 is based on a stratospheric correction using simulated stratospheric NO2 instead of applying the reference sector method, which was used in a previous study. The model approach is more suitable for boreal latitudes. TVC NO2 and FRP are spatially aggregated to a 1 degrees x 1 degrees horizontal resolution and temporally averaged to monthly values. The conversion of the satellite-derived tropospheric NO2 columns into production rates of NOx from fire (Pf) is based on the NO2/NO5 ratio as obtained from the MACC reanalysis data set and an assumed lifetime of NOx. A global land cover map is used to define boreal forests across these two regions in order to evaluate the FERs of NOx for this biome. The FERs of NOx, which are derived from the gradients of the linear relationship between Pf and FRP, are more than 30% lower for North American than for Eurasian boreal forest fires. We speculate that these discrepancies are mainly related to the variable nitrogen content in plant tissues, which is higher in deciduous forests dominating large parts in Eurasia. In order to compare the obtained values with EFs found in the literature, the FERs are converted into EFs. The satellite-based EFs of NOx are estimated at 0.83 and 0.61 g kg(-1) for Eurasian and North American boreal forests, respectively, which is in good agreement with the value found in a recent emission factor compilation. However, recent fire emission inventories are based on EFs of NOx that are 3-5 times larger, which indicates that there are still large uncertainties in estimates of NOx from biomass burning, especially on the regional scale.

Adjusting the VOC emissions using simulated/observed ratios improved model performance of each VOC species, especially mitigating the mean bias substantially. Simulated monthly mean ozone showed a minor change: a 0.4 ppb or 1.2% increase; while a change of more than 5 ppb was seen in hourly ozone data on high ozone days, this change moved model predictions closer to observations. The CMAQ model run with the adjusted emissions better reproduced the variability in the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA)'s Ozone Monitoring Instrument COMO formaldehyde (HCHO) columns. The adjusted model scenario also slightly better reproduced the aircraft HCHO concentrations from NASA's DISCOVER-AQ campaign conducted during the simulation episode period; Correlation, Mean Bias and RMSE improved from 0.34, 1.38 ppb and 2.15 ppb to 0.38, 1.33 ppb and 2.08 ppb respectively. A process analysis conducted for both industrial/ urban and rural areas suggested that chemistry was the main process contributing to ozone production in both areas, while the impact of chemistry was smaller in rural areas than in industrial and urban areas. For both areas, the positive chemistry contribution increased in the sensitivity simulation largely due to the increase in emissions. Nudging VOC emissions to match the observed concentrations shifted the ozone hotspots outside the industrial/urban region and enhanced the peaked ozone in the outflow region with consistent southerly/southeasterly winds during the afternoon time (1-5 pm). This study helps in the understanding of these processes which are critical to constrain high peak ozone values in the outflow regions. The results indicate that formation of ozone in the outflow could complicate attainment status in neighboring counties. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

We discuss the roles of meteorology, emissions, and transport from the stratosphere in driving the interannual variability in different regions and seasons. We demonstrate that a hindcast simulation for 1991-2010 can reproduce much of the observed variability and the trends in summertime ozone, with correlation coefficients for seasonally and regionally averaged median ozone ranging from 0.46 to 0.89. Reproducing the interannual variability in winter and spring in the western United States may require higher-resolution models to adequately represent stratosphere-troposphere exchange. Hindcast simulations with fixed versus variable emissions show that changes in anthropogenic emissions drive the observed negative trends in monthly median ozone concentrations in the eastern United States during summer, as well as the observed reduction in the amplitude of the seasonal cycle. The simulation underestimates positive trends in the western United States during spring, but excluding the first 4 years of data removes many of the statistically significant trends in this region. The reduction in the slope of the ozone versus temperature relationship before and after major emission reductions is also well represented by the model.

Air pollution levels, however, are highly sensitive to both emissions and meteorological fluctuations. Therefore, an assessment of the change in air pollutant levels due to emissions controls must account for these meteorological fluctuations. Two empirical methods to quantify the impact of meteorology on pollutant levels are discussed and applied to the 13-year time period between 2000 and 2012 in Atlanta, GA. The methods employ Kolmogorov-Zurbenko filters and linear regressions to detrended pollutant signals into long-term, seasonal, weekly, short-term, and white-noise components. The methods differ in how changes in weekly and holiday emissions are accounted for. Both can provide meteorological adjustments on a daily basis for future use in acute health analyses. The meteorological impact on daily signals of ozone, NOx, CO, SO2, PM2.5, and PM species are quantified. Analyses show that the substantial decreases in seasonal averages of NOx and SO2 correspond with controls implemented in the metropolitan Atlanta area. Detrending allows for the impacts of some controls to be observed with averaging times of as little as 3 months. Annual average concentrations of NOx, SO2, and CO have all fallen by at least 50% since 2000. Reductions in NOx levels, however, do not lead to uniform reductions in ozone. While average detrended summer average maximum daily average 8 h ozone (MDA8h O-3) levels fell by 4% (2.2 +/- 2 ppb) between 2000 and 2012, winter averages have increased by 12% (3.8 +/- 1.4 ppb), providing further evidence that high ozone levels are NOx-limited and lower ozone concentrations are NOx-inhibited. High ozone days (with MDA8h O-3 greater than 60 ppb) decreased both in number and in magnitude over the study period. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Zonally averaged, the relative standard deviation (SD) of daily MDA8 JJA ozone shows a bimodal structure, with peaks at 28-32 and 40-45 degrees N, and we show that those regions are most influenced by the variability in daily weather. We apply empirical orthogonal functions (EOFs) to understand the causes of this structure. The first three leading EOF patterns explain 53% of the total variance in detrended surface ozone, displaying (1) a widespread response of ozone in the eastern United States associated with north-south movement of jet wind latitude, (2) a north-south pattern linked to the Bermuda High system when its west boundary is located along the east coast, and (3) an east-west pattern characteristic of a westward extension of the Bermuda High and an enhanced Great Plains low level jet (GPLLJ). The northern peak of ozone relative SD can be explained by polar jet activity, while the southern peak appears related to variability in the Bermuda High and GPLLJ. We define a new metric polar jet frequency as the total number of days the jet traverses the Midwest and northeast each summer. In the Midwest and northeast, we find that the correlation coefficient r between detrended mean JJA MDA8 ozone and the polar jet frequency ranges between 0.76 and 0.93 over 1980-2012 depending on the time period selected, suggesting that polar jet frequency could provide a simple metric to predict ozone variability in future climate regimes. In the southeast, the influence of the Bermuda High on mean JJA MDA8 ozone depends on the location of its west edge. For those summers when the aver-age position of the west edge is located west of similar to 85.4 degrees W, a westward shift in the Bermuda High west edge increases ozone in the southeast by similar to 1 ppbv deg(-1) in longitude. For all summers, a northward shift in the Bermuda High west edge increases ozone over the entire eastern United States by 1-2 ppbv deg(-1) in latitude. None of the synoptic patterns identified in this study show a significant trend from 1980 to 2012, confirming that the observed ozone decrease over the eastern United States during this time period is mainly caused by emission controls. Our work underscores the impact of synoptic patterns on ozone variability and suggests that a combination of changing local and synoptic meteorology together with trends in background ozone will determine the influence of climate change on US ozone air quality in future decades. The observed relationships of US surface ozone and synoptic circulations in this study can also be used to validate models of atmospheric chemistry.",0,0,1.5.1,Meteorological Effects on Ozone Concentrations at the Ground Level

VW has admitted the inclusion of defeat devices. On-road emissions testing suggests that in-use NOx emissions for these vehicles are a factor of 10 to 40 above the EPA standard. In this paper we quantify the human health impacts and associated costs of the excess emissions. We propagate uncertainties throughout the analysis. A distribution function for excess emissions is estimated based on available in-use NOx emissions measurements. We then use vehicle sales data and the STEP vehicle fleet model to estimate vehicle distance traveled per year for the fleet. The excess NOx emissions are allocated on a 50 km grid using an EPA estimate of the light duty diesel vehicle NOx emissions distribution. We apply a GEOS-Chem adjoint-based rapid air pollution exposure model to produce estimates of particulate matter and ozone exposure due to the spatially resolved excess NOx emissions. A set of concentration-response functions is applied to estimate mortality and morbidity outcomes. Integrated over the sales period (2008-2015) we estimate that the excess emissions will cause 59 (95% CI: 10 to 150) early deaths in the US. When monetizing premature mortality using EPA-recommended data, we find a social cost of similar to$450m over the sales period. For the current fleet, we estimate that a return to compliance for all affected vehicles by the end of 2016 will avert similar to 130 early deaths and avoid similar to$840m in social costs compared to a counterfactual case without recall.",0,0,2.8,Evidence Inventories?????Data Tables to Provide Supporting Information

Temporal variance is determined by observations in one method, with the annual mean CMAQ field providing spatial structure. A second method involves scaling daily CMAQ simulated fields using mean observations to reduce bias. Finally, a weighted average of these results based on prediction of temporal variance provides optimized daily estimates for each 12 ? 12 km grid. These methods were applied to daily metrics of 12 pollutants (CO, NO2, NOx, O3, SO2, PM10, PM2.5, and five PM2.5 components) over the state of Georgia for a seven-year period (2002-2008). Cross-validation demonstrates a wide range in optimized model performance across pollutants, with SO2 predicted most poorly due to limitations in coal combustion plume monitoring and modeling. For the other pollutants studied, 54-88% of the spatiotemporal variance (Pearson R(2) from cross-validation) was captured, with ozone and PM2.5 predicted best.

The direct decoupled method has been extensively applied for sensitivity studies of air pollution. Adjoint sensitivity is a complementary approach which efficiently calculates the derivatives of a functional with respect to a large number of parameters. In this paper, we discuss the mathematical foundations of the adjoint sensitivity method applied to air pollution models, and present a complete set of computational tools for performing three-dimensional adjoint sensitivity studies.

Two different simulations are completed with the halogen chemistry: without and with photochemical reactions of higher iodine oxides. Enhanced deposition reduces mean summer-time surface ozone by similar to 3% over marine regions in the Northern Hemisphere.

In this paper, we examine changes in SO2 and NO2 over some of the world's most polluted industrialized regions during the first decade of OMI observations. In terms of regional pollution changes, we see both upward and downward trends, sometimes in opposite directions for NO2 and SO2, for different study areas. The trends are, for the most part, associated with economic and/or technological changes in energy use, as well as regional regulatory policies. Over the eastern US, both NO2 and SO2 levels decreased dramatically from 2005 to 2015, by more than 40 and 80aEuro-%, respectively, as a result of both technological improvements and stricter regulations of emissions. OMI confirmed large reductions in SO2 over eastern Europe's largest coal-fired power plants after installation of flue gas desulfurization devices. The North China Plain has the world's most severe SO2 pollution, but a decreasing trend has been observed since 2011, with about a 50aEuro-% reduction in 2012-2015, due to an economic slowdown and government efforts to restrain emissions from the power and industrial sectors.

The only large increases in the United States may be associated with three areas of intensive energy activity. Second, elevated NO2 levels were observed over many Asian, tropical, and subtropical cities that experienced rapid economic growth. Two of the largest increases occurred over recently expanded petrochemical complexes in Jamnagar (India) and Daesan (Korea). Third, pollution transport from China possibly influenced the Republic of Korea and Japan, diminishing the impact of local pollution controls. However, in China, there were large decreases over Beijing, Shanghai, and the Pearl River Delta, which were likely associated with local emission control efforts.

The imported aerosol not only can serve as an additional source to regional air pollution (e.g., direct input), but also can influence regional air quality through the aerosol-cloud-radiation (ACR) interactions that change local and regional meteorology. This study assessed impacts of the transpacific aerosol on air quality, focusing on surface ozone and PM2.5, over the U.S. using the NASA Unified Weather Research Forecast model. Based on the results of 3-month (April to June of 2010) simulations, the impact of direct input (as an additional source) of transpacific aerosol caused an increase of surface PM2.5 concentration by approximately 1.5 mu g m(-3) over the west coast and about 0.5 mu g m(-3) over the east coast of the U.S. By influencing key meteorological processes through the ACR interactions, the transpacific aerosol exerted a significant effect on both surface PM2.5 (+/- 6 mu g m(-3)) and ozone (+/- 12 ppbv) over the central and eastern U.S. This suggests that the transpacific transport of aerosol could either improve or deteriorate local air quality and complicate local effort toward the compliance with the U.S. National Ambient Air Quality Standards.

In comparison with observations, model simulations at current configurations underestimate ozone (O-3) and volatile organic compound (VOC) concentrations, especially during the elevated episode periods. The model results, however, are generally comparable with previous studies and the simulations adequately capture the spatial and temporal variability of these pollutant concentrations. In comparison with observations and model control runs, model simulations with irrigation runs are slightly improved. Our results show that irrigation increases primary pollutant concentrations in the irrigated areas under cloudless conditions, consistent with previous studies. In July and August, 2005, for instance, with clear skies, irrigation increases hourly surface [CO] up to 40 ppb with an irrigated grid average of 16 ppb or 8.3%; [VOC] up to 10 ppb with an irrigated grid average of 4.6 ppb or 21.4%; and [NOx] up to 4 ppb with irrigated grid average of 0.72 ppb or 12.6%, especially near urban areas during daytime. On the other hand, irrigation marginally decreases ground-level ozone concentrations ([O-3]) over irrigated land: it decreases hourly [O-3] by -0.14 ppb or -0.45% and decreases daily 8 h maximum average (DMA8) [O-3] by -0.39 ppb or -0.76%. In contrast, irrigation increases hourly [O-3] up to 5 ppb over the surrounding unirrigated areas of the San Joaquin Valley, during both daytime and nighttime. Furthermore, except for the Pacific Northwest, similar patterns of ozone variation are simulated by the model in other irrigated regions in the continental United States. The explanation is that irrigation results in cooler ground surfaces, which first decreases instability and turbulence, leading to a weakening of the vertical mixing of primary pollutants. Therefore, irrigation increases surface primary pollutant concentrations within the irrigation zone. Irrigation also results in daytime local circulations that enhance horizontal transport of ozone and other pollutants from irrigated to unirrigated areas near the ground surface. Because our results are based on two months in 2005 and on national anthropogenic emission inventories, the magnitude of these ozone changes could vary somewhat year to year; nonetheless, the methods and results from this study can be applied to any heavily polluted and irrigated agricultural area.

In this work, the Weather Research and Forecasting model with Chemistry version 3.4.1 (WRF/Chem v. 3.4.1) with the 2005 Carbon Bond mechanism coupled with the Volatility Basis Set module for secondary organic aerosol formation (WRF/Chem-CB05-VBS) is applied for multiple years (2001, 2006, and 2010) over continental U.S. This work also examines the changes in simulated air quality and meteorology due to changes in emissions and meteorology and the model's capability in reproducing the observed variation trends in species concentrations from 2001 to 2010. In addition, the impacts of the chemical ICONs/BCONs on model predictions are analyzed. ICONs/BCONs are downscaled from two global models, the modified Community Earth System Model/Community Atmosphere model version 5.1 (CESM/CAM v5.1) and the Monitoring Atmospheric Composition and Climate model (MACC). The evaluation of WRF/Chem-CB05-VBS simulations with the CESM ICONs/BCONs for 2001, 2006, and 2010 shows that temperature at 2m (T2) is underpredicted for all three years likely due to inaccuracies in soil moisture and soil temperature, resulting in biases in surface relative humidity, wind speed, and precipitation. With the exception of cloud fraction, other aerosol-cloud variables including aerosol optical depth, cloud droplet number concentration, and cloud optical thickness are underpredicted for all three years, resulting in overpredictions of radiation variables. The model performs well for O-3 and particulate matter with diameter less than or equal to 2.5 (PM2.5) for all three years comparable to other studies from literature.

In this study, nested WRF-Chem simulations with a finest grid resolution of 1 km are conducted to investigate ozone concentrations [O-3] due to urbanization within cities in arid/semi-arid environments. First, a method based on a shape preserving Monotonic Cubic Interpolation (MCI) is developed and used to downscale anthropogenic emissions from the 4 km resolution 2005 National Emissions Inventory (NEI05) to the finest model resolution of 1 km. Using the rapidly expanding Phoenix metropolitan region as the area of focus, we demonstrate the proposed MCI method achieves ozone simulation results with appreciably improved correspondence to observations relative to the default interpolation method of the WRF-Chem system. Next, two additional sets of experiments are conducted, with the recommended MCI approach, to examine impacts of urbanization on ozone production: (1) the urban land cover is included (i.e., urbanization experiments) and, (2) the urban land cover is replaced with the region's native shrubland. Impacts due to the presence of the built environment on [O-3] are highly heterogeneous across the metropolitan area. Increased near surface [O-3] due to urbanization of 10-20 ppb is predominantly a nighttime phenomenon while simulated impacts during daytime are negligible. Urbanization narrows the daily [O-3] range (by virtue of increasing nighttime minima), an impact largely due to the region's urban heat island. Our results demonstrate the importance of the MCI method for accurate representation of the diurnal profile of ozone, and highlight its utility for high-resolution air quality simulations for urban areas.",0,0,2.8,Evidence Inventories?????Data Tables to Provide Supporting Information

Recently, PX LSM WRF/CMAQ has been updated in vegetation, soil, and boundary layer processes resulting in improved 2m temperature (T) and mixing ratio (Q), 10m wind speed, and surface ozone simulations across the domain compared to the previous version for a period around August 2006. Yearlong meteorology simulations with the updated system demonstrate that MODIS input helps reduce bias of the 2m Q estimation during the growing season from April to September. Improvements follow the green-up in the southeast from April and move toward the west and north through August. From October to March, MODIS input does not have much influence on the system because vegetation is not as active. The greatest effects of MODIS input include more accurate phenology, better representation of leaf area index (LAI) for various forest ecosystems and agricultural areas, and realistically sparse vegetation coverage in the western drylands. Despite the improved meteorology, MODIS input causes higher bias for the surface O-3 simulation in April, August, and October in areas where MODIS LAI is much less than the base LAI. Thus, improvements may be needed in the CMAQ dry deposition model for low LAI areas where deposition on the soil surface becomes important.",0,0,1.6.2,Advances in Regional Chemical Transport Modeling

Previous evaluation results have demonstrated that the updated FDDA approach in WRF provides more accurate wind fields aloft than the original approach, particularly during the nocturnal period when low level jets are a common feature in the Eastern United States. Due to the importance of WRF/FDDA meteorological fields in retrospective air quality applications, a modeling study with the Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) model was undertaken to ascertain if the improved wind flow fields translate into better performance for ozone. To undertake this objective, separate CMAQ model simulations were performed with meteorological inputs generated by WRF using the original and the updated FDDA approaches for a three month summer period. The evaluation effort focused on observed and modeled surface ozone from a mid-morning hour (10 local daylight time (LDT)). Comparisons of modeled results against concentrations aloft from an instrumented tall tower and from available morning vertical profile measurements were also examined. Surface concentrations near 10 LDT are desirable for evaluating the transport process since they are often representative of ozone that has been transported aloft overnight and has undergone downward entrainment in response to convective mixing the following morning. Statistical results from surface observed and modeled concentration pairs indicated modeled ozone from the CMAQ simulation using the updated FDDA meteorology displayed smaller biases and lower absolute errors at 88% and 80% of monitoring sites, respectively, in the Eastern United States. The CMAQ results with the updated FDDA generally exhibited smaller biases and lower absolute errors at monitoring sites across the northern states than in the southeastern states.

We used mixed layer observations from the SEAC(4)RS aircraft campaign over the Southeast US to test the ability of the GEOS-Chem chemical transport model at different grid resolutions (0.25 degrees x 0.3125 degrees, 2 degrees x 2.5 degrees, 4 degrees x 5 degrees) to simulate this chemistry under high-isoprene, variable-NOx conditions. Observations of isoprene and NOx over the Southeast US show a negative correlation, reflecting the spatial segregation of emissions; this negative correlation is captured in the model at 0.25 degrees x 0.3125 degrees resolution but not at coarser resolutions. As a result, less isoprene oxidation takes place by the high-NOx pathway in the model at 0.25 degrees x 0.3125 degrees resolution (54%) than at coarser resolution (59%). The cumulative probability distribution functions (CDFs) of NOx, isoprene, and ozone concentrations show little difference across model resolutions and good agreement with observations, while formaldehyde is overestimated at coarse resolution because excessive isoprene oxidation takes place by the high-NOx pathway with high formaldehyde yield. The good agreement of simulated and observed concentration variances implies that smaller-scale non-linearities (urban and power plant plumes) are not important on the regional scale. Correlations of simulated vs. observed concentrations do not improve with grid resolution because finer modes of variability are intrinsically more difficult to capture. Higher model resolution leads to decreased conversion of NOx to organic nitrates and increased conversion to nitric acid, with total reactive nitrogen oxides (NOy) changing little across model resolutions. Model concentrations in the lower free troposphere are also insensitive to grid resolution.

Observation nudging, along with objective analysis, is generally considered a low-cost and effective technique to improve meteorological simulations. However, the meteorological impact of observation nudging on chemistry has not been well characterized. This study involved two simulations to analyze the impact of observation nudging on simulated meteorology and ozone concentrations during the 2013 Deriving Information on Surface conditions from Column and Vertically Resolved Observations Relevant to Air Quality (DISCOVER-AQ) Texas campaign period, using the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) and Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) models. The results showed improved correlations between observed and simulated parameters. For example, the index of agreement (IOA) improved by about 9 % for surface temperature and 6-11 % for surface zonal (U-WIND) and meridional (V-WIND) winds when observation nudging was employed. Analysis of a cold front event indicated that nudging improved the timing of wind transition during the front passage. Observation nudging also reduced the model biases for the planetary boundary layer height predictions. Additionally, the IOA for CMAQ simulated surface ozone improved by 6 % during the simulation period. The high-ozone episode on 25 September was a post-front ozone event in Houston. The small-scale morning wind shifts near the Houston Ship Channel combined with higher aloft ozone early morning likely caused the day's ozone exceedance. While observation nudging did not recreate the wind shifts on that day and failed to reproduce the observed high ozone, analyses of surface and aircraft data found that observation nudging helped the model yield improved ozone predictions. In a 2 h period during the event, substantially better winds in the sensitivity case noticeably improved the ozone. The average IOA for ozone in the period increased from just over 0.4 to near 0.7.

The suite of measurements on board the BAe-146 aircraft, deployed in this campaign, allows us to calculate the production of O-3 and of aPNs, a long-lived NOx reservoir whose concentration is supposed to be impacted by biomass burning emissions. In fire plumes, profiles of carbon monoxide (CO), which is a well-established tracer of pyrogenic emission, show concentration enhancements that are in strong correspondence with a significant increase of concentrations of aPNs, whereas minimal increase of the concentrations of O-3 and NO2 is observed. The aPN and O-3 productions have been calculated using the rate constants of the first- and second-order reactions of volatile organic compound (VOC) oxidation. The aPN and O-3 productions have also been quantified by 0-D model simulation based on the Master Chemical Mechanism. Both methods show that in fire plumes the average production of aPNs and O-3 are greater than in the background plumes, but the increase of aPN production is more pronounced than the O-3 production. The average aPN production in fire plumes is from 7 to 12 times greater than in the background, whereas the average O-3 production in fire plumes is from 2 to 5 times greater than in the background. These results suggest that, at least for boreal forest fires and for the measurements recorded during the BORTAS campaign, fire emissions impact both the oxidized NOy and O-3,O- but (1 aPN production is amplified significantly more than O-3 production and (2) in the forest fire plumes the ratio between the O-3 production and the aPN production is lower than the ratio evaluated in the background air masses, thus confirming that the role played by the aPNs produced during biomass burning is significant in the O-3 budget. The implication of these observations is that fire emissions in some cases, for example boreal forest fires and in the conditions reported here, may influence more long-lived precursors of O-3 than short-lived pollutants, which in turn can be transported and eventually diluted in a wide area.",0,0,1.3.1.3.3,Landscape Fires

A bootstrap algorithm was used to test for significant bias and error in the forecasts from each model. Both models produce significant positively biased forecasts in the morning while generally becoming insignificantly biased in the afternoon during peak ozone hours. The NAQFC-beta produces higher forecast bias, higher forecast error, and lower correlations than the NAQFC.

The NAQFC-beta tends to produce an average background ozone mixing ratio of at least 3.51 ppbv greater than the NAQFC throughout the domain at 95 % significance. The difference between the two models is significant during the overnight and early morning hours likely due to the way the Carbon Bond 5 mechanism in the NAQFC-beta handles reactive nitrogen recycling and organic peroxide species.

<br>Methods: We developed a modeling framework that estimates temporal trends from regulatory agency and cohort-specific monitoring data from MESA Air measurement campaigns and incorporates land use regression with universal kriging using predictor variables from a large geographic database. The cohort-specific data were measured at home and community locations. The framework was applied in estimating two-week average ozone concentrations from 1999 to 2013 in models of each of the six MESA Air metropolitan regions.

We have investigated the mechanisms and pharmacological sensitivity of ozone-induced hypertussive responses in rabbits and guinea pigs. Ozone induced a significant increase in cough frequency and a decrease in time to first cough to inhaled citric acid in both conscious guinea pigs and rabbits. This response was inhibited by the established antitussive drugs codeine and levodropropizine. In contrast to the guinea pig, hypertussive responses in the rabbit were not inhibited by bronchodilator drugs (beta(2) agonists or muscarinic receptor antagonists), suggesting that the observed hypertussive state was not secondary to bronchoconstriction in this species. The ozone-induced hypertussive response in the rabbit was inhibited by chronic pretreatment with capsaicin, suggestive of a sensitization of airway sensory nerve fibers. However, we could find no evidence for a role of TRPA1 in this response, suggesting that ozone was not sensitizing airway sensory nerves via activation of this receptor. Whereas the ozone-induced hypertussive response was accompanied by a significant influx of neutrophils into the airway, the hypertussive response was not inhibited by the anti-inflammatory phosphodiesterase 4 inhibitor roflumilast at a dose that clearly exhibited anti-inflammatory activity.

To date, most investigations have used time-series models, and it is not well understood how exposure misclassification arising from unmeasured spatial variation may impact epidemiological effect estimates. Here, we develop case-crossover models integrating temporal and spatial individual-level exposure information, toward reducing exposure misclassification in estimating associations between air pollution and child asthma exacerbations in New York City (NYC).
<br>
<br>Methods: Air pollution data included: (a) highly spatially-resolved intra-urban concentration surfaces for ozone and co-pollutants (nitrogen dioxide and fine particulate matter) from the New York City Community Air Survey (NYCCAS), and (b) daily regulatory monitoring data. Case data included citywide hospital records for years 2005-2011 warm-season (June-August) asthma hospitalizations (n=2353) and Emergency"" Department (ED) visits (n=11,719) among children aged 5-17 years. Case residential locations were geocoded using a multi-step process to maximize positional accuracy and precision in near residence exposure estimates. We used conditional logistic regression to model associations between ozone and child asthma exacerbations for lag days 0-6, adjusting for co-pollutant and temperature exposures. To evaluate the effect of increased exposure specificity through spatial air pollution information, we sequentially incorporated spatial variation into daily exposure estimates for ozone, temperature, and co-pollutants.
<br>
<br>Results: Percent excess risk per 10 ppb ozone exposure in spatio-temporal models were significant on lag days 1 through 5, ranging from 6.5 (95% CI: 0.2-13.1) to 13.0 (6.0-20.6) for inpatient hospitalizations, and from 2.9(95% Cl: 0.1-5.7) to 9.4(6.3-12.7) for ED visits, with strongest associations consistently observed on lag day 2. Spatio-temporal excess risk estimates were consistently but not statistically significantly higher than temporal-only estimates on lag days 0-3.

<br>Conclusion: Incorporating case-level spatial exposure variation produced small, non-significant increases in excess risk estimates. Our modeling approach enables a refined understanding of potential measurement error in temporal-only versus spatio-temporal air pollution exposure assessments. As ozone generally varies over much larger spatial scales than that observed within NYC, further work is necessary to evaluate potential reductions in exposure misclassification for populations spanning wider geographic areas, and for other pollutants.

Ozone caused airway hyperreactivity one day post-exposure, and blocking p38 and JNK MAPK completely prevented ozone-induced airway hyperreactivity. Blocking p38 and JNK MAPK also suppressed parasympathetic nerve activity in air exposed animals, suggesting p38 and JNK MAPK contribute to acetylcholine release by airway parasympathetic nerves.

T cells in the induction of alternatively activated M2 macrophages and the resolution of inflammation after ozone exposure. Wildtype (WT) mice and mice deficient in ?? T cells (TCR?-/- mice) were exposed to air or to ozone (0.3 ppm for up to 72h) and euthanized immediately or 1, 3, or 5 days after cessation of exposure. In WT mice, M2 macrophages accumulated in the lungs over the course of ozone exposure. Pulmonary mRNA abundance of the M2 genes, Arg1, Retnla, and Clec10a, also increased after ozone. In contrast, no evidence of M2 polarization was observed in TCR?-/- mice. WT but not TCR?-/- mice expressed the M2c polarizing cytokine, IL-17A, after ozone exposure and WT mice treated with an IL-17A neutralizing antibody exhibited attenuated ozone-induced M2 gene expression. In WT mice, ozone-induced increases in bronchoalveolar lavage neutrophils and macrophages resolved quickly after cessation of ozone exposure returning to air exposed levels within 3 days. However, lack of M2 macrophages in TCR?-/- mice was associated with delayed clearance of inflammatory cells after cessation of ozone and increased accumulation of apoptotic macrophages in the lungs. Delayed restoration of normal lung architecture was also observed in TCR?-/- mice. In summary, our data indicate that ?? T cells are required for the resolution of ozone-induced inflammation, likely because ??

Inflammation may be due to mucosal damage, upper (sensory) and lower (pulmonary) airway irritation due to activation of the trigeminal and vagal nerves, respectively, and to neurogenic inflammation. The terpene, d-limonene, is used as a fragrance in numerous consumer products. When limonene reacts with the pulmonary irritant ozone, a complex mixture of gas and particle phase products is formed, which causes sensory irritation. This study investigated whether limonene, ozone or the reaction mixture can exacerbate allergic lung inflammation and whether airway irritation is enhanced in allergic BALB/cJ mice. Naive and allergic (ovalbumin sensitized) mice were exposed via inhalation for three consecutive days to clean air, ozone, limonene or an ozone-limonene reaction mixture. Sensory and pulmonary irritation was investigated in addition to ovalbumin-specific antibodies, inflammatory cells, total protein and surfactant protein D in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and hemeoxygenase-1 and cytokines in lung tissue. Overall, airway allergy was not exacerbated by any of the exposures. In contrast, it was found that limonene and the ozone-limonene reaction mixture reduced allergic inflammation possibly due to antioxidant properties. Ozone induced sensory irritation in both naive and allergic mice. However, allergic but not naive mice were protected from pulmonary irritation induced by ozone.

The air quality simulations for that historical period are then compared to observations from four national networks. Comparisons are drawn between defined performance metrics and other published modeling results for predicted ozone, fine particulate matter, and speciated fine particulate matter. The results indicate that the historical air quality simulations driven by dynamically downscaled meteorology are typically within defined modeling performance benchmarks and are consistent with results from other published modeling studies using finer-resolution meteorology. This indicates that the regional climate and air quality modeling framework utilized here does not introduce substantial bias, which provides confidence in the method's use for future air quality projections.

Circulating adrenaline levels dropped to nearly zero in DEMED and ADREX rats relative to SHAM. Corticosterone tended to be low in DEMED rats and dropped to nearly zero in ADREX rats. Adrenalectomy in air-exposed rats caused modest changes in metabolites and lung toxicity parameters.

The results of immunological and inflammatory biomarkers (total-immunoglobulin (Ig) E and Th cytokines) as well as histopathological examination and AHR assessment supported the notion that high doses of ozone (>0.5 ppm) could induce inflammation and lung injury in mice and that this induction was counteracted by concurrent administration of VE. The elimination of oxidative stress, the reduced Th2 responses and Ig production, and the relief of lung damage were proposed to explain the molecular mechanism of ozone induced lung injury.

The initial and boundary conditions are downscaled from the modified Community Earth System Model/Community Atmosphere Model (CESM/CAM5) v1.2.2. The meteorological initial and boundary conditions are bias-corrected using the National Center for Environmental Protection's Final (FNL) Operational Global Analysis data. Climatological evaluations are carried out for meteorological, chemical, and aerosol-cloud-radiation variables against data from surface networks and satellite retrievals. The model performs very well for the 2 m temperature (T2) for the 10-year period, with only a small cold bias of -0.3 degrees C. Biases in other meteorological variables including relative humidity at 2 m, wind speed at 10 m, and precipitation tend to be site-and season-specific; however, with the exception of T2, consistent annual biases exist for most of the years from 2001 to 2010. Ozone mixing ratios are slightly overpredicted at both urban and rural locations with a normalized mean bias (NMB) of 9.7% but underpredicted at rural locations with an NMB of -8.8 %. PM2.5 concentrations are moderately overpredicted with an NMB of 23.3% at rural sites but slightly underpredicted with an NMB of -10.8% at urban/suburban sites.

Cloud-aerosol variables including aerosol optical depth, cloud water path, cloud optical thickness, and cloud droplet number concentration are generally underpredicted on average across the continental US. Overpredictions of several cloud variables over the eastern US result in underpredictions of radiation variables (such as net shortwave radiation - GSW - with a mean bias - MB - of -5.7 W m(-2)) and overpredictions of shortwave and longwave cloud forcing (MBs of similar to 7 to 8 W m(-2)), which are important climate variables.

A typical office building was modeled in EnergyPlus in fourteen U.S. cities to assess the energy use and airflows delivered by an ideal variable air volume (VAV) system in a range of climates. Two mechanical ventilation strategies (minimum; minimum + economizer control) were modeled, as well as two analogous natural ventilation strategies, which used a fan-driven recirculation hybrid system to maintain setpoints if necessary. Outputted hourly ventilation, recirculation, and infiltration rates were used in an indoor air model with city specific outdoor monitoring data to compute indoor concentrations of carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, formaldehyde, nitrogen dioxide, ozone, and fine particles (PM2.5). Natural ventilation decreased energy use, due to a wider temperature setpoint band for natural ventilation scenarios and somewhat lower fan energy use. Indoor concentrations and indoor/outdoor (I/O) ratios of all pollutants were similar for analogous strategies, except PM2.5, which was reduced by filtration in the supply air. Median PM2.5 I/O ratios were a factor of 1.2, 2.2, and 6.3 larger for natural versus mechanical ventilation strategies with MERV 8, 11, and 16 filters, respectively. The filtration impact was so strong that PM2,5 I/O ratios differed little between mechanical minimum and economizing strategies, especially as filter efficiency increased. These results can be used to understand tradeoffs of energy and indoor air pollution trends of natural versus mechanical ventilation. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

The modeling system was applied to track the contribution from a wildfire (Wallow) and prescribed fire (Flint Hills) using both source sensitivity and source apportionment approaches. The model estimated fire contribution to primary and secondary pollutants are comparable using source sensitivity (brute-force zero out) and source apportionment (Integrated Source Apportionment Method) approaches. Model estimated O-3 enhancement relative to CO is similar to values reported in literature indicating the modeling system captures the range of O-3 inhibition possible near fires and O-3 production both near the fire and downwind. O-3 and peroxyacetyl nitrate (PAN) are formed in the fire plume and transported downwind along with highly reactive VOC species such as formaldehyde and acetaldehyde that are both emitted by the fire and rapidly produced in the fire plume by VOC oxidation reactions. PAN and aldehydes contribute to continued downwind O-3 production. The transport and thermal decomposition of PAN to nitrogen oxides (NOx) enables O-3 production in areas limited by NOx availability and the photolysis of aldehydes to produce free radicals (HOX) causes increased O-3 production in NOx rich areas. The modeling system tends to overestimate hourly surface O-3 at routine rural monitors in close proximity to the fires when the model predicts elevated fire impacts on O-3 and Hazard Mapping System (HMS) data indicates possible fire impact. A sensitivity simulation in which solar radiation and photolysis rates were more aggressively attenuated by aerosol in the plume reduced model O-3 but does not eliminate this bias. A comparison of model predicted daily average speciated PM2.5 at surface rural routine network sites when the model predicts fire impacts from either of these fires shows a tendency toward overestimation of PM2.5 organic aerosol in close proximity to these fires. The standard version of the CMAQtreats primarily emitted organic aerosol as non-volatile. An alternative approach for treating organic aerosol as semi-volatile resulted in lower PM2.5 organic aerosol from these fires but does not eliminate the bias. Future work should focus on modeling specific fire events that are well characterized in terms of size, emissions, and have extensive measurements taken near the fire and downwind to better constrain model representation of important physical and chemical processes (e.g. aerosol photolysis attenuation and organic aerosol treatment) related to wild and prescribed fires.

A primary objective of this study is to identify an effective method for correcting the effects of meteorology on July MDA8. We find significant correlations between July MDA8 O-3 and meteorological variables for sites in or near Denver, Colorado, and Salt Lake City, Utah. The highest correlations were for 500hPa heights, surface temperatures, and 700hPa temperatures and zonal winds. We conclude that increased 500hPa heights lead to high July O-3 in much of the western U.S., particularly in areas of elevated terrain near urban sources of NO2 and other O-3 precursors. In addition to bringing warmer temperatures and fewer clouds, upper level ridges decrease winds and allow cyclic terrain-driven circulations to reduce transport away from sources. Because of strong, nearly linear responses of July MDA8 to 500hPa heights, it is not reasonable to use uncorrected trends in peak O-3 for assessments of the effectiveness of emissions controls for much of the western U.S. Robust linear regressions for July MDA8 and tropospheric NO2 with 500hPa heights can be used to assess and correct trends in July MDA8 in the Intermountain West.",0,0,1.5.1,Meteorological Effects on Ozone Concentrations at the Ground Level

Here we describe a new version of BEIS which includes updated input vegetation data and canopy model formulation for estimating leaf temperature and vegetation data on estimated BVOC.

Vegetation species data are based on the US Forest Service (USFS) Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) version 5.1 for 2002-2013 and US Department of Agriculture (USDA) 2007 census of agriculture data. This update results in generally higher BVOC emissions throughout California compared with the previous version of BEIS. Baseline and updated BVOC emission estimates are used in Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) Model simulations with 4aEuro-km grid resolution and evaluated with measurements of isoprene and monoterpenes taken during multiple field campaigns in northern California.

The TES observation operator was applied to the sonde data to ensure a consistent comparison between TES and ozonesonde data, i.e. without the influence of the a priori O-3 profile needed to regulate the retrieval. Generally, TES V004 O-3 retrievals are biased high by 2-7 ppbv (7-15 %) in the troposphere, consistent with validation results from earlier studies. Because of two degrees of freedom for signal in the troposphere, we can distinguish between upper and lower troposphere mean biases, respectively ranging from -0.4 to +13.3 ppbv for the upper troposphere and +3.9 to +6.0 ppbv for the lower troposphere. Focusing on the 464 hPa retrieval level, broadly representative of the free tropospheric O-3, we find differences in the TES biases for the tropics (+3 ppbv, +7 %), sub-tropics (+5 ppbv, +11 %), and northern (+7 ppbv, +13 %) and southern mid-latitudes (+4 ppbv, +10 %). The relatively long-term record (6 yr) of TES-ozonesonde comparisons allowed us to quantify temporal variations in TES biases at 464 hPa. We find that there are no discernable biases in each of these latitudinal bands; temporal variations in the bias are typically within the uncertainty of the difference between TES and ozonesondes.

Having both the spatial and temporal dimensions adds substantial complexity to data analysis and inference tasks. The computational complexity increases rapidly for fitting Bayesian hierarchical models, as such a task involves repeated inversion of large matrices. The primary focus of this paper is on developing space?time autoregressive models under the hierarchical Bayesian setup. To handle large data sets, a recently developed Gaussian predictive process approximation method is extended to include autoregressive terms of latent space?time processes. Specifically, a space?time autoregressive process, supported on a set of a smaller number of knot locations, is spatially interpolated to approximate the original space?time process. The resulting model is specified within a hierarchical Bayesian framework, and Markov chain Monte Carlo techniques are used to make inference. The proposed model is applied for analysing the daily maximum 8?h average ground level ozone concentration data from 1997 to 2006 from a large study region in the Eastern United States. The developed methods allow accurate spatial prediction of a temporally aggregated ozone summary, known as the primary ozone standard, along with its uncertainty, at any unmonitored location during the study period.

Hierarchical models based on well known time series modeling methods such as the dynamic linear models (DLM) and the auto-regressive (AR) models are often used in the literature. The DLM, developed as a result of the popularity of Kalman filtering methods, provide a dynamical state-space system that is thought to evolve from a pair of state and observation equations. The AR models, on the other hand, cast in a Bayesian hierarchical setting, have recently been developed through a pair of models where a measurement error model is formulated at the top level and an AR model for the true ozone concentration levels is postulated at the next level. Each of the modeling scenarios is set in an appropriate multivariate setting to model the spatial dependence. This paper compares these two methods in hierarchical Bayesian settings. A simplified skeletal version of the DLM taken from Dou et al. (2010) [5] is compared theoretically with a matching hierarchical AR model. The comparisons reveal many important differences in the induced space?time correlation structures. Further comparisons of the variances of the predictive distributions by conditioning on different sets of data for each model show superior performances of the AR models under certain conditions. These theoretical investigations are followed up by a simulation study and a real data example implemented using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods for modeling daily maximum eight-hour average ozone concentration levels observed in the state of New York in the months of July and August, 2006.

The animals were exposed to 0 or 0.8 ppm ozone for 9 consecutive weekdays (4 h/d). Mice were killed 24 hours after exposure, and nasal tissues were selected for histopathology and gene expression analysis. ILC-sufficient C57BL/6 and Rag2(-/-) mice exposed to ozone developed marked eosinophilic rhinitis and epithelial remodeling (e.g., epithelial hyperplasia and mucous cell metaplasia). Chitinase-like proteins and alarmins (IL-33, IL-25, and thymic stromal lymphopoietin) were also increased morphometrically in the nasal epithelium of ozone-exposed C57BL/6 and Rag2(-/-) mice. Ozone exposure elicited increased expression of Il4, Il5, Il13, St2, eotaxin, MCP-2, Gob5, Arg1, Fizz1, and Ym2mRNA in C57BL/6 and Rag2(-/-) mice. In contrast, ozone-exposed ILC-deficient Rag2(-/-)Il2rg(-/-) mice had no nasal lesions or overexpression of Th2-or ILC2-related transcripts. These results indicate that ozone-induced eosinophilic rhinitis, nasal epithelial remodeling, and type 2 immune activation are dependent on ILCs. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to demonstrate that ILCs play an important role in the nasal pathology induced by repeated ozone exposure.",0,0,3.1.3,Biological Plausibility

The impact of thunderstorms on the O-3 composition in the upper troposphere/lower stratosphere (LS) region was analyzed. Overshooting cloud tops injected high amounts of biomass burning and lightning-produced NOx emissions into the LS, in addition to low O-3 mixing ratios from the lower troposphere. As a dynamical response, O-3-rich air from the LS was transported downward into the anvil and also surrounded the outflow. The Delta O-3/Delta CO ratio was determined in the anvil outflow region. A pronounced in-mixing of O-3-rich stratospheric air masses was observed in the outflow indicated by highly positive or even negative Delta O-3/Delta CO ratios (+1.4 down to -3.9).

We derived time series of 2006-2008 O3 concentrations consistent with 50% and 75% NOx emissions reduction scenarios in three urban areas (Atlanta, Philadelphia, and Chicago) at each monitor location and spatially interpolated O3 to census-tract centroids.<br /><br /><strong>RESULTS: </strong>We predicted that low O3 concentrations would increase and high O3 concentrations would decrease in response to NOx reductions within an urban area. O3 increases occurred across larger areas for the seasonal mean metric than for the regulatory metric (annual 4th highest daily 8-hr maximum) and were located only in urban core areas. O3 always decreased outside the urban core (e.g., at locations of maximum local ozone concentration) for both metrics and decreased within the urban core in some instances. NOx reductions led to more uniform spatial gradients and diurnal and seasonal patterns and caused seasonal peaks in midrange O3 concentrations to shift from midsummer to earlier in the year.<br /><br /><strong>CONCLUSIONS: </strong>These changes have implications for how O3 exposure may change in response to NOx reductions and are informative for the design of future epidemiology studies and risk assessments.<br /><br /><strong>CITATION: </strong>Simon H, Wells B, Baker KR, Hubbell B. 2016.

One essential aspect of the proposed approach is the propagation in parallel of all independent uncertainty components through the data processing chain before they are combined together to form the ozone combined standard uncertainty. The independent uncertainty components contributing to the overall budget include random noise associated with signal detection, uncertainty due to saturation correction, background noise extraction, the absorption cross sections of O-3, NO2, SO2, and O-2, the molecular extinction cross sections, and the number densities of the air, NO2, and SO2. The expression of the individual uncertainty components and their step-by-step propagation through the ozone differential absorption lidar (DIAL) processing chain are thoroughly estimated. All sources of uncertainty except detection noise imply correlated terms in the vertical dimension, which requires knowledge of the covariance matrix when the lidar signal is vertically filtered. In addition, the covariance terms must be taken into account if the same detection hardware is shared by the lidar receiver channels at the absorbed and non-absorbed wavelengths. The ozone uncertainty budget is presented as much as possible in a generic form (i.e., as a function of instrument performance and wavelength) so that all NDACC ozone DIAL investigators across the network can estimate, for their own instrument and in a straightforward manner, the expected impact of each reviewed uncertainty component. In addition, two actual examples of full uncertainty budget are provided, using nighttime measurements from the tropospheric ozone DIAL located at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) Table Mountain Facility, California, and nighttime measurements from the JPL stratospheric ozone DIAL located at Mauna Loa Observatory, Hawai'i.",0,0,1.6.1.2,Remote Sensing Methods Used for Investigating the Distribution and Atmospheric Concentrations of Ozone

TEMPO observes from Mexico City, Cuba, and the Bahamas to the Canadian oil sands, and from the Atlantic to the Pacific, hourly and at high spatial resolution (~2.1 km N/S?4.4 km E/W at 36.5?N, 100?W). TEMPO provides a tropospheric measurement suite that includes the key elements of tropospheric air pollution chemistry, as well as contributing to carbon cycle knowledge. Measurements are made hourly from geostationary (GEO) orbit, to capture the high variability present in the diurnal cycle of emissions and chemistry that are unobservable from current low-Earth orbit (LEO) satellites that measure once per day. The small product spatial footprint resolves pollution sources at sub-urban scale. Together, this temporal and spatial resolution improves emission inventories, monitors population exposure, and enables effective emission-control strategies.

TEMPO takes advantage of a commercial GEO host spacecraft to provide a modest cost mission that measures the spectra required to retrieve ozone (O3), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), sulfur dioxide (SO2), formaldehyde (H2CO), glyoxal (C2H2O2), bromine monoxide (BrO), IO (iodine monoxide), water vapor, aerosols, cloud parameters, ultraviolet radiation, and foliage properties. TEMPO thus measures the major elements, directly or by proxy, in the tropospheric O3 chemistry cycle. Multi-spectral observations provide sensitivity to O3 in the lowermost troposphere, substantially reducing uncertainty in air quality predictions. TEMPO quantifies and tracks the evolution of aerosol loading. It provides these near-real-time air quality products that will be made publicly available.

Model estimates of surface ozone concentrations tend to be biased high in the region and this is of concern for designing effective emission control strategies to meet air quality standards. We use detailed chemical observations from the SEAC(4)RS aircraft campaign in August and September 2013, interpreted with the GEOS-Chem chemical transport model at 0.25 degrees x 0.3125 degrees horizontal resolution, to better understand the factors controlling surface ozone in the Southeast US. We find that the National Emission Inventory (NEI) for NOx from the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is too high. This finding is based on SEAC(4)RS observations of NOx and its oxidation products, surface network observations of nitrate wet deposition fluxes, and OMI satellite observations of tropospheric NO2 columns. Our results indicate that NEI NOx emissions from mobile and industrial sources must be reduced by 30-60 %, dependent on the assumption of the contribution by soil NOx emissions. Upper-tropospheric NO2 from lightning makes a large contribution to satellite observations of tropospheric NO2 that must be accounted for when using these data to estimate surface NOx emissions. We find that only half of isoprene oxidation proceeds by the high-NOx pathway to produce ozone; this fraction is only moderately sensitive to changes in NOx emissions because isoprene and NOx emissions are spatially segregated. GEOS- Chem with reduced NOx emissions provides an unbiased simulation of ozone observations from the aircraft and reproduces the observed ozone production efficiency in the boundary layer as derived from a regression of ozone and NOx oxidation products. However, the model is still biased high by 6 +/- 14 ppb relative to observed surface ozone in the Southeast US. Ozonesondes launched during midday hours show a 7 ppb ozone decrease from 1.5 km to the surface that GEOS- Chem does not capture.

Order-of-magnitude increases in fertilizer use are seen as a critical step in attaining food security. This increase represents an unprecedented input of nitrogen (N) to African ecosystems and will likely be accompanied by increased soil emissions of nitric oxide (NO). NO is a precursor to tropospheric ozone, an air pollutant and greenhouse gas. Emissions of NO from soils occur primarily during denitrification and nitrification, and N input rates are a key determinant of emission rates. We established experimental maize plots in western Kenya to allow us to quantify the response function relating NO flux to N input rate during the main 2011 and 2012 growing seasons. NO emissions followed a sigmoid response to fertilizer inputs and have emission factors under 1% for the roughly two-month measurement period in each year, though linear and step relationships could not be excluded in 2011. At fertilization rates above 100 kg N ha(-1) , NO emissions increased without a concomitant increase in yields. We used the GEOS-Chem chemical transport model to evaluate local impacts of increased NO emissions on tropospheric ozone concentrations. Mean 4-hour afternoon tropospheric ozone concentrations in Western Kenya increased by up to roughly 2.63 ppbv under fertilization rates of 150 kg N ha(-1) or higher. Using AOT40, a metric for assessing crop damage from ozone, we find that the increased ozone concentrations result in an increase in AOT40 exposure of approximately110 ppb h for inputs of 150 kg N ha(-1) during the March-April-May crop growing season, compared with unfertilized simulations, with negligible impacts on crop productivity.

Population exposures to air pollutants both indoors and outdoors are influenced by a wide range of air quality, meteorological, behavioral, and housing-related factors, many of which are also impacted by climate change. An integrated methodology for modeling changes in human exposures to tropospheric ozone (O3) owing to potential future changes in climate and demographics was implemented by linking existing modeling tools for climate, weather, air quality, population distribution, and human exposure. Human exposure results from the Air Pollutants Exposure Model (APEX) for 12 US cities show differences in daily maximum 8-h (DM8H) exposure patterns and levels by sex, age, and city for all scenarios. When climate is held constant and population demographics are varied, minimal difference in O3 exposures is predicted even with the most extreme demographic change scenario. In contrast, when population is held constant, we see evidence of substantial changes in O3 exposure for the most extreme change in climate. Similarly, we see increases in the percentage of the population in each city with at least one O3 exposure exceedance above 60?p.p.b and 70?p.p.b thresholds for future changes in climate. For these climate and population scenarios, the impact of projected changes in climate and air quality on human exposure to O3 are much larger than the impacts of changing demographics.

Because of the important health and climate impacts of tropospheric ozone, it is imperative to quantify background photochemical ozone concentrations and ozone layers aloft, especially during air quality episodes. For these reasons, this paper addresses the necessary procedures to validate the TROPOZ retrieval algorithm and confirm that it is properly representing ozone concentrations. This paper is focused on ensuring the TROPOZ algorithm is properly quantifying ozone concentrations, and a following paper will focus on a systematic uncertainty analysis. This methodology begins by simulating synthetic lidar returns from actual TROPOZ lidar return signals in combination with a known ozone profile. From these synthetic signals, it is possible to explicitly determine retrieval algorithm biases from the known profile. This was then systematically performed to identify any areas that need refinement for a new operational version of the TROPOZ retrieval algorithm. One immediate outcome of this exercise was that a bin registration error in the correction for detector saturation within the original retrieval was discovered and was subsequently corrected for. Another noticeable outcome was that the vertical smoothing in the retrieval algorithm was upgraded from a constant vertical resolution to a variable vertical resolution to yield a statistical uncertainty of < 10 %. This new and optimized vertical-resolution scheme retains the ability to resolve fluctuations in the known ozone profile, but it now allows near-field signals to be more appropriately smoothed. With these revisions to the previous TROPOZ retrieval, the optimized TROPOZ retrieval algorithm (TROPOZ(opt)) has been effective in retrieving nearly 200m lower to the surface. Also, as compared to the previous version of the retrieval, the TROPOZopt had an overall mean improvement of 3.5 %, and large improvements (upwards of 10-15% as compared to the previous algorithm) were apparent between 4.5 and 9 km. Finally, to ensure the TROPOZopt retrieval algorithm is robust enough to handle actual lidar return signals, a comparison is shown between four nearby ozonesonde measurements. The ozonesondes are mostly within the TROPOZopt retrieval uncertainty bars, which implies that this exercise was quite successful.",0,0,1.6.1.2,Remote Sensing Methods Used for Investigating the Distribution and Atmospheric Concentrations of Ozone

In contrast, until recently, emissions have increased in East Asia and most strongly in China. As emissions change, the distribution of hourly O-3 concentrations also changes, as do the values of exposure metrics. The distribution changes can result in the exposure metric trend patterns changing in a similar direction as trends in emissions (e.g., metrics increase as emissions increase) or, in some cases, in opposite directions. This study, using data from 481 sites (276 in the EU, 196 in the US, and 9 in China), investigates the response of 14 human health and vegetation O-3 exposure metrics to changes in hourly O-3 concentration distributions over time. At a majority of EU and US sites, there was a reduction in the frequency of both relatively high and low hourly average O-3 concentrations. In contrast, for some sites in mainland China and Hong Kong, the middle of the distribution shifted upwards but the low end did not change and for other sites, the entire distribution shifted upwards. The responses of the 14 metrics to these changes at the EU, US, and Chinese sites were varied, and dependent on (1) the extent to which the metric was determined by relatively high, moderate, and low concentrations and (2) the relative magnitude of the shifts occurring within the O-3 concentration distribution. For example, the majority of the EU and US sites experienced decreasing trends in the magnitude of those metrics associated with higher concentrations. For the sites in China, all of the metrics either increased or had no trends. In contrast, there were a greater number of sites that had no trend for those metrics determined by a combination of moderate and high O-3 concentrations. A result of our analyses is that trends in mean or median concentrations did not appear to be well associated with some exposure metrics applicable for assessing human health or vegetation effects. The identification of shifting patterns in the O-3 distribution and the resulting changes in O-3 exposure metrics across regions with large emission increases and decreases is an important step in examining the linkage between emissions and exposure metric trends. The results provide insight into the utility of using specific exposure metrics for assessing emission control strategies. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Since 1980, anthropogenic emissions of ozone precursors-methane, non-methane volatile organic compounds, carbon monoxide and nitrogen oxides (NOx)have shifted from developed to developing regions. Emissions have thereby been redistributed equatorwards(3-6), where they are expected to have a stronger effect on the tropospheric ozone burden due to greater convection, reaction rates and NOx sensitivity(7-11). Here we use a global chemical transport model to simulate changes in tropospheric ozone concentrations from 1980 to 2010, and to separate the influences of changes in the spatial distribution of global anthropogenic emissions of short-lived pollutants, the magnitude of these emissions, and the global atmospheric methane concentration. We estimate that the increase in ozone burden due to the spatial distribution change slightly exceeds the combined influences of the increased emission magnitude and global methane. Emission increases in Southeast, East and South Asia may be most important for the ozone change, supported by an analysis of statistically significant increases in observed ozone above these regions. The spatial distribution of emissions dominates global tropospheric ozone, suggesting that the future ozone burden will be determined mainly by emissions from low latitudes.",0,0,1.3.1.2.1,Global Methane

We examine these conjoined processes with observations and global chemistry-climate model (GFDL-AM3) hindcasts over 1980-2014. The model captures the salient features of observed trends in daily maximum 8 h average O-3: (1) increases over East Asia (up to 2 ppb yr(-1)), (2) springtime increases at western US (WUS) rural sites (0.2-0.5 ppb yr(-1)) with a baseline sampling approach, and (3) summertime decreases, largest at the 95th percentile, and wintertime increases in the 50th to 5th percentiles over the eastern US (EUS). Asian NOx emissions have tripled since 1990, contributing as much as 65% to modeled springtime background O-3 increases (0.3-0.5 ppb yr(-1)) over the WUS, outpacing O-3 decreases attained via 50% US NOx emission controls. Methane increases over this period contribute only 15% of the WUS background O-3 increase. Springtime O-3 observed in Denver has increased at a rate similar to remote rural sites. During summer, increasing Asian emissions approximately offset the benefits of US emission reductions, leading to weak or insignificant observed O-3 trends at WUS rural sites. Mean springtime WUS O-3 is projected to increase by similar to 10 ppb from 2010 to 2030 under the RCP8.5 global change scenario. While historical wildfire emissions can enhance summertime monthly mean O-3 at individual sites by 2-8 ppb, high temperatures and the associated buildup of O-3 produced from regional anthropogenic emissions contribute most to elevating observed summertime O-3 throughout the USA. GFDL-AM3 captures the observed interannual variability of summertime EUS O-3. However, O-3 deposition sink to vegetation must be reduced by 35% for the model to accurately simulate observed high-O-3 anomalies during the severe drought of 1988. Regional NOx reductions alleviated the O-3 buildup during the recent heat waves of 2011 and 2012 relative to earlier heat waves (e.g., 1988, 1999). The O-3 decreases driven by NOx controls were more pronounced in the southeastern US, where the seasonal onset of biogenic isoprene emissions and NOx -sensitive O-3 production occurs earlier than in the northeast. Without emission controls, the 95th percentile summertime O-3 in the EUS would have increased by 0.2-0.4 ppb yr(-1) over 1988-2014 due to more frequent hot extremes and rising biogenic isoprene emissions.",0,0,1.6.2,Advances in Regional Chemical Transport Modeling

Here we use 2005-2016 summertime HCHO column data from the OMI satellite instrument, validated with high-quality aircraft data and oversampled on a 5 ? 5 km(2) grid, to map surface air HCHO concentrations across the contiguous U.S. OMI-derived summertime HCHO values are converted to annual averages using the GEOS-Chem chemical transport model. Results are in good agreement with high-quality summertime observations from urban sites (-2% bias, r = 0.95) but a factor of 1.9 lower than annual means from the EPA network. We thus estimate that up to 6600-12?500 people in the U.S. will develop cancer over their lifetimes by exposure to outdoor HCHO. The main HCHO source in the U.S. is atmospheric oxidation of biogenic isoprene, but the corresponding HCHO yield decreases as the concentration of nitrogen oxides (NOx ? NO + NO2) decreases.

Recently, version 5.1 of the CMAQ model (v5.1) was released to the public, incorporating a large number of science updates and extended capabilities over the previous release version of the model (v5.0.2). These updates include the following: improvements in the meteorological calculations in both CMAQ and the Weather Research and Forecast (WRF) model used to provide meteorological fields to CMAQ, updates to the gas and aerosol chemistry, revisions to the calculations of clouds and photolysis, and improvements to the dry and wet deposition in the model. Sensitivity simulations isolating several of the major updates to the modeling system show that changes to the meteorological calculations result in enhanced afternoon and early evening mixing in the model, periods when the model historically underestimates mixing. This enhanced mixing results in higher ozone (O-3) mixing ratios on average due to reduced NO titration, and lower fine particulate matter (PM2.5) concentrations due to greater dilution of primary pollutants (e.g., elemental and organic carbon). Updates to the clouds and photolysis calculations greatly improve consistency between the WRF and CMAQ models and result in generally higher O-3 mixing ratios, primarily due to reduced cloudiness and attenuation of photolysis in the model. Updates to the aerosol chemistry result in higher secondary organic aerosol (SOA) concentrations in the summer, thereby reducing summertime PM2.5 bias (PM2.5 is typically underestimated by CMAQ in the summer), while updates to the gas chemistry result in slightly higher O-3 and PM2.5 on average in January and July. Overall, the seasonal variation in simulated PM2.5 generally improves in CMAQv5.1 (when considering all model updates), as simulated PM2.5 concentrations decrease in the winter (when PM2.5 is generally overestimated by CMAQ) and increase in the summer (when PM2.5 is generally underestimated by CMAQ). Ozone mixing ratios are higher on average with v5.1 vs. v5.0.2, resulting in higher O-3 mean bias, as O-3 tends to be overestimated by CMAQ throughout most of the year (especially at locations where the observed O-3 is low); however, O-3 correlation is largely improved with v5.1. Sensitivity simulations for several hypothetical emission reduction scenarios show that v5.1 tends to be slightly more responsive to reductions in NOx (NO + NO2), VOC and SOx (SO2 + SO4) emissions than v5.0.2, representing an improvement as previous studies have shown CMAQ to underestimate the observed reduction in O-3 due to large, widespread reductions in observed emissions.",0,0,1.6.2,Advances in Regional Chemical Transport Modeling

A WRF-SMOKE-CMAQ air quality modeling system was used to investigate the contributions of these inputs. In this space, a base WRF run (BASE) and a WRF run initializing with NOAA GOES satellite sea surface temperature (SST) (SENS) were performed to clarify the impact of high-resolution SST on simulated surface ozone (O-3) over the Greater Houston area during 25 September 2013, corresponding to the high O-3 episode during the NASA DISCOVER-AQ Texas campaign. The SENS case showed reduced land-sea thermal contrast during early morning hours due to 1-2 C lower SST over water bodies. The lowered SST reduced the model wind speed and slowed the dilution rate. These changes led to a simulated downwind O-3 change of-.5 ppb near the area over land with peak simulated afternoon O-3. However, the SENS case still under-predicted surface O-3 in urban and industrial areas. Episodic flare emissions, dry sunny postfrontal stagnated conditions, and land-bay/sea breeze transitions could be the potential causes of the high O-3.
<br>
<br>In order to investigate the additional sources of error, three sensitivity simulations were performed for the high ozone time period. These involved adjusted emissions, adjusted wind fields, and both adjusted emissions and winds. These scenarios were superimposed on the updated SST (SENS) case. Adjusting NOx and VOC emissions using simulated/observed ratios improved correlation and index of agreement (IOA) for NOx from 0.48 and 0.55 to 0.81 and 0.88 respectively, but still reported spatial misalignment of afternoon 03 hotspots. Adjusting wind fields to represent morning weak westerly winds and afternoon converging zone significantly mitigated under-estimation of the observed O-3 peak. For example, simulations with adjusted wind fields and adjusted (emissions + wind fields) reduced under-estimation of the peak magnitude of 100 ppb from 50 ppb to 7 and 9 ppb. Additionally, these sensitivity cases captured the timing and location of the observed O-3 hotspots. The simulation case with both adjusted emissions and wind fields showed the best statistics for NOx (correlation: 0.84; IOA: 0.90) and O-3 (correlation: 0.87; IOA: 0.92). These comparisons suggest that emissions and wind fields are important in determining the magnitude of high peaks, and wind direction is more critical in determining their timing and location. Particularly, improving the model capability to reproduce small-scale meteorological conditions favoring O-3 production, such as stagnation and wind reversal, is crucial for accurate placement of locations of peak O-3 and its precursors.

Studies that incorporate space-time exposures of individuals are essential to further our understanding of the short-term health effects of ambient air pollution.<br /><br /><strong>OBJECTIVES: </strong>As part of a longitudinal cohort study of the acute effects of air pollution that incorporated subject-specific information and medical histories of subjects throughout the follow-up, the purpose of this study was to develop and compare different prediction models using data from fixed-site monitors and other monitoring campaigns to estimate daily, spatially-resolved concentrations of ozone (O3) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) of participants' residences in Montreal, 1991-2002.<br /><br /><strong>METHODS: </strong>We used the following methods to predict spatially-resolved daily concentrations of O3 and NO2 for each geographic region in Montreal (defined by three-character postal code areas): (1) assigning concentrations from the nearest monitor; (2) spatial interpolation using inverse-distance weighting; (3) back-extrapolation from a land-use regression model from a dense monitoring survey, and; (4) a combination of a land-use and Bayesian maximum entropy model. We used a variety of indices of agreement to compare estimates of exposure assigned from the different methods, notably scatterplots of pairwise predictions, distribution of differences and computation of the absolute agreement intraclass correlation (ICC). For each pairwise prediction, we also produced maps of the ICCs by these regions indicating the spatial variability in the degree of agreement.<br /><br /><strong>RESULTS: </strong>We found some substantial differences in agreement across pairs of methods in daily mean predicted concentrations of O3 and NO2. On a given day and postal code area the difference in the concentration assigned could be as high as 131ppb for O3 and 108ppb for NO2. For both pollutants, better agreement was found between predictions from the nearest monitor and the inverse-distance weighting interpolation methods, with ICCs of 0.89 (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.89, 0.89) for O3 and 0.81 (95%CI: 0.80, 0.81) for NO2, respectively. For this pair of methods the maximum difference on a given day and postal code area was 36ppb for O3 and 74ppb for NO2. The back-extrapolation method showed a higher degree of disagreement with the nearest monitor approach, inverse-distance weighting interpolation, and the Bayesian maximum entropy model, which were strongly constrained by the sparse monitoring network. The maps showed that the patterns of agreement differed across the postal code areas and the variability depended on the pair of methods compared and the pollutants. For O3, but not NO2, postal areas showing greater disagreement were mostly located near the city centre and along highways, especially in maps involving the back-extrapolation method.<br /><br /><strong>CONCLUSIONS: </strong>In view of the substantial differences in daily concentrations of O3 and NO2 predicted by the different methods, we suggest that analyses of the health effects from air pollution should make use of multiple exposure assessment methods. Although we cannot make any recommendations as to which is the most valid method, models that make use of higher spatially resolved data, such as from dense exposure surveys or from high spatial resolution satellite data, likely provide the most valid estimates.",0,0,2.3.2.1,Spatial Interpolation

The results indicate that marine halogen emissions decrease ozone and nitrogen dioxide levels up to 5ppbv and 2.5ppbv, respectively, in the city of Los Angeles. Previous studies suggested that the inclusion of chlorine in air quality models leads to the generation of ozone in urban areas through photolysis of nitryl chloride (ClNO2). However, we find that when considering the chemistry of Cl, Br and I together the net effect is a reduction of surface ozone concentrations. Furthermore, combined ocean emissions of halogens and DMS cause substantial changes in the levels of key urban atmospheric oxidants such as OH, HO2 and NO3, and in the composition and mass of fine particles. Although the levels of ozone, NO3 and HOx are reduced, we find a 10% increase in secondary organic aerosol (SOA) mean concentration, attributed to the increase in aerosol acidity and sulfate aerosol formation when combining DMS and bromine. Therefore, this new pathway for enhanced SOA formation may potentially help with current model under predictions of urban SOA.

Data analysis indicates multiple factors affect the downwind NO2/NOX ratio. These include spatial gradient, background ozone (O3), source emissions of NO and NO2, and background NO2/NOX ratio. Analysis of the NO2/NOX ratio spatial gradient indicates that under high O3 conditions, the change in the ratio is fairly constant once a certain O3 threshold (?30 ppb) is reached. However, under low O3 conditions (<30 ppb), there are differences between weekdays and weekends, most likely due to a decline in O3 concentrations during the weekday morning hours, reducing the O3 available to titrate the emitted NO, allowing lower NO2/NOX ratios. These results suggest that under high O3 conditions, NOX chemistry is driving the NO2/NOX ratios whereas under low O3 conditions, atmospheric mixing is the driving factor.",0,0,2.6.2,Long Term Exposure

A national scale air quality modeling analysis was performed to estimate the impact of the sector emissions changes on future year annual and 24-hour PM2.5 concentrations, 8-hr maximum ozone, as well as visibility impairment. Air quality benefits are estimated with the Community Multi-scale Air Quality (CMAQ) model. CMAQ simulates the numerous physical and chemical processes involved in the formation, transport, and destruction of ozone, particulate matter and other air pollutants. In addition to the CMAQ model, the modeling platform includes the emissions, meteorology, and initial and boundary condition data which are inputs to this model. Emissions and air quality modeling decisions are made early in the analytical process. For this reason, it is important to note that the inventories used in the air quality modeling may be slightly different than the final utility sector inventories presented in the RIA. However, the air quality inventories and the final rule inventories are generally consistent, so the air quality modeling adequately reflects the effects of the rule.",0,0,2.8,Evidence Inventories?????Data Tables to Provide Supporting Information

We report on in situ measurements of ozone (O-3), a suite of volatile organic compounds (VOCs), and reactive oxidized nitrogen species collected during summer 2015 at the Boulder Atmospheric Observatory (BAO) in Erie, CO. Aged wildfire smoke impacted BAO during two distinct time periods during summer 2015: 6-10 July and 16-30 August. The smoke was transported from the Pacific Northwest and Canada across much of the continental US. Carbon monoxide and particulate matter increased during the smoke-impacted periods, along with peroxyacyl nitrates and several VOCs that have atmospheric lifetimes longer than the transport timescale of the smoke. During the August smoke-impacted period, nitrogen dioxide was also elevated during the morning and evening compared to the smoke-free periods. There were nine empirically defined high-O-3 days during our study period at BAO, and two of these days were smoke impacted. We examined the relationship between O-3 and temperature at BAO and found that for a given temperature, O-3 mixing ratios were greater (similar to 10 ppbv) during the smoke-impacted periods. Enhancements in O-3 during the August smoke-impacted period were also observed at two long-term monitoring sites in Colorado: Rocky Mountain National Park and the Arapahoe National Wildlife Refuge near Walden, CO.

The statistical model represents between 35% and 81% of the variance in MDA8 for each city.

A major concern associated with the burning is the contribution of smoke to elevated ground level ambient ozone (O3). The objective of this study is to estimate contributions of Kansas rangeland burning to ambient O3 mixing ratios through regression analysis (1) between observed O3 data and available satellite burn activity data from 2001 to 2016; and (2) between observed O3 data and the smoke contributions to PM2.5 which were resolved from receptor modeling. Positive correlations were observed between ambient O3 levels and the acres burned each year estimated from satellite imagery. When burned acres in April were larger than or equal to 1.9 million, O3&gt;70ppb occurred at least at one of the ten monitoring sites in Kansas. Statistical regression models of daily maximum 8-hour O3 mixing ratios were developed at each of the ten monitoring sites using meteorological predictors. The O3 model residuals that were not explained by the meteorological effect models were affected by PM2.5 contributors including sulfate/industrial sources and emissions that generated secondary organic particles, such as rangeland burning, which were derived from receptor modeling. The average O3 model residual on the high O3 days in April was 21?9ppb, which was likely associated with smoke emissions from burning. Research will continue to obtain daily satellite burn activity data and to correlate burn data with daily O3 data, so that modeling of O3 levels can be improved under influences of daily burn activities. Less frequency of high O3 days was observed in April since 2011, which may be partly due to implementation of the Flint Hills Smoke Management Plan which promoted better timing of burns.",0,0,1.3.1.3.3,Landscape Fires

There is a need, however, to develop and demonstrate appropriate practices for model application and evaluation in an accountability framework. We employ a combination of traditional and novel evaluation techniques to assess four years (2001-02, 2011-12) of simulated pollutant concentrations across a decade of major emissions reductions using the Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) model. We have grouped our assessments in three categories: Operational evaluation investigates how well CMAQ captures absolute concentrations; dynamic evaluation investigates how well CMAQ captures changes in concentrations across the decade of changing emissions; diagnostic evaluation investigates how CMAQ attributes variability in concentrations and sensitivities to emissions between meteorology and emissions, and how well this attribution compares to empirical statistical models. In this application, CMAQ captures O-3 and PM2.5 concentrations and change over the decade in the Eastern United States similarly to past CMAQ applications and in line with model evaluation guidance; however, some PM2.5 species-EC, OC, and sulfate in particular-exhibit high biases in various months. CMAQ-simulated PM2.5 has a high bias in winter months and low bias in the summer, mainly due to a high bias in OC during the cold months and low bias in OC and sulfate during the summer. Simulated O-3 and PM2.5 changes across the decade have normalized mean bias of less than 2.5% and 17%, respectively. Detailed comparisons suggest biased EC emissions, negative wintertime SOi-sensitivities to mobile source emissions, and incomplete capture of OC chemistry in the summer and winter. Photochemical grid model simulated 03 and PM2.5 responses to emissions and meteorologically across the decade match results from receptor-based, statistical regression models. PM2.5 sensitivities to mobile source emissions in the summertime have decreased substantially, but wintertime mobile sensitives remain largely unchanged because decreases in negative SOi- sensitivities match decreases in positive sensitivities from other constituents. Similarly, NOx emissions have led to decreased summertime O-3 and increased wintertime O-3 because of opposite sensitivities. Overall, results show that emissions reductions improved air quality across the domain and remain a viable option for improving future air quality. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

The space-based tropospheric column ratio of formaldehyde to NO2 (FNR) has been used as an indicator to identify NOx-limited versus NOx-saturated O-3 formation regimes. Quantitative use of this indicator ratio is subject to three major uncertainties: (1) the split between NOx-limited and NOx-saturated conditions may shift in space and time, (2) the ratio of the vertically integrated column may not represent the near-surface environment, and (3) satellite products contain errors. We use the GEOS-Chem global chemical transport model to evaluate the quantitative utility of FNR observed from the Ozone Monitoring Instrument over three northern midlatitude source regions. We find that FNR in the model surface layer is a robust predictor of the simulated near-surface O-3 production regime. Extending this surface-based predictor to a column-based FNR requires accounting for differences in the HCHO and NO2 vertical profiles. We compare four combinations of two OMI HCHO and NO2 retrievals with modeled FNR. The spatial and temporal correlations between the modeled and satellite-derived FNR vary with the choice of NO2 product, while the mean offset depends on the choice of HCHO product. Space-based FNR indicates that the spring transition to NOx-limited regimes has shifted at least a month earlier over major cities (e.g., New York, London, and Seoul) between 2005 and 2015. This increase in NOx sensitivity implies that NOx emission controls will improve O-3 air quality more now than it would have a decade ago.
<br>
<br>Plain Language Summary Surface ozone has adverse effects on public health, agriculture, and ecosystems. As a pollutant that is not directly emitted, ozone forms from two classes of precursors: oxides of nitrogen (NOx) and volatile organic compounds (VOCs). We use satellite observations of formaldehyde (HCHO, a marker of VOCs) and NO2 (a marker of NOx) to identify areas that would benefit more from reducing NOx emissions (NOx-limited) versus reducing VOC emissions (VOC-limited). We use a global chemical transport model (GEOS-Chem) to develop a set of threshold values for HCHO/NO2 that separate the NOx-limited and VOC-limited conditions. Satellite instruments do not measure the ground level concentrations but instead the vertical column density of the air above the surface. We use GEOS-Chem to link the column HCHO/NO2 with ground level HCHO/NO2. Combining model-derived threshold values with a decadal record of satellite observations, we find that major cities over northern midlatitude source regions (e.g., New York, London, and Seoul) show increasingly longer NOx-limited ozone chemistry in the warm season. This trend reflects the NOx emission controls implemented over the past decade. Increasing NOx sensitivity implies that regional NOx emission control programs will improve ozone air quality more now than it would have a decade ago.",0,0,1.6.1.2,Remote Sensing Methods Used for Investigating the Distribution and Atmospheric Concentrations of Ozone

The aim of this study was to explore consequences of environmental exposures to diesel exhaust (DE) and ozone (O3) and ultimately to interpret these parameters from the perspective of in vitro to in vivo extrapolation. In particular, the objective was to use cytokine expression at the cellular level as a biomarker for physiological systemic responses such as blood pressure and lung function at the systemic level. The values obtained could ultimately link in vivo behavior to simpler in vitro experiments where cytokines are a measured parameter. Human exposures to combinations of DE and O3 and the response correlations between forced exhaled volume in 1 second (FEV1), forced vital capacity (FVC), systolic and diastolic blood pressure (SBP and DBP, respectively), and 10 inflammatory cytokines in blood (interleukins 1?, 2, 4, 5, 8, 10, 12p70 and 13, IFN-?, and TNF-?) were determined in 15 healthy human volunteers. Results across all exposures revealed that certain individuals displayed greater inflammatory responses compared to the group and, generally, there was more between-person variation in the responses. Evidence indicates that individuals are more stable within themselves and are more likely to exhibit responses independent of one another. Data suggest that in vitro findings may ultimately be implemented to elucidate underlying adverse outcome pathways (AOP) for linking high-throughput toxicity tests to physiological in vivo responses. Further, this investigation supports assessing subjects based upon individual responses as a complement to standard longitudinal (pre vs. post) intervention grouping strategies.

The flexibility of the framework allows for input of data in any choice of time scales and CTM predictions of any spatial resolution with varying associated degrees of estimation error and cost in terms of implementation and computation. This study quantifies the impact on exposure estimation error due to these choices by first comparing estimations errors when BME relied on ozone concentration data either as an hourly average, the daily maximum 8-h average (DM8A), or the daily 24-h average (D24A). Our analysis found that the use of DM8A and D24A data, although less computationally intensive, reduced estimation error more when compared to the use of hourly data. This was primarily due to the poorer CTM model performance in the hourly average predicted ozone. Our second analysis compared spatial variability and estimation errors when BME relied on CTM predictions with a grid cell resolution of 12 x 12 km(2) versus a coarser resolution of 36 x 36 km(2). Our analysis found that integrating the finer grid resolution CTM predictions not only reduced estimation error, but also increased the spatial variability in daily ozone estimates by 5 times. This improvement was due to the improved spatial gradients and model performance found in the finer resolved CTM simulation. The integration of observational and model predictions that is permitted in a BME framework continues to be a powerful approach for improving exposure estimates of ambient air pollution. The results of this analysis demonstrate the importance of also understanding model performance variability and its implications on exposure error. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Multiple stakeholders, including policy-makers, industry, and public health professionals, seek to quantify the benefits of regulations on air pollution and public health, a major focus of air pollution accountability research. Two methods, one empirical, the other based on a chemical transport model (CTM), are used to calculate the sensitivities of ozone (O-3) and particulate matter with diameters less than 2.5 mu m (PM2.5) to electricity-generating unit (EGU) and mobile source emissions. Both methods are applied to determine impacts of controls on daily concentrations (which are important in assessing acute health responses to air pollution), accounting for nonlinear, meteorologically, and emission-dependent responses of pollutant concentrations. The statistical method separates contributions of nearby EGU, regional EGU, and mobile source emissions on ambient city-center concentrations. Counterfactual emissions, an estimate of emissions under a scenario where no new controls were implemented on local EGU sources after 1995, regional EGUs after 1997, and mobile sources after 1993, are combined with these sensitivities to estimate counterfactual concentrations that represent what daily air quality in Atlanta, GA would have been had controls not been implemented and other emissions-reducing actions not been taken. Regulatory programs are linked with reduced peak summertime O-3, but have had little effect on annual median concentrations at the city-center monitoring site, and led to increases in pollutant levels under less photochemically-active conditions. The empirical method and the CTM method found similar relationships between ozone concentrations and ozone sensitivity to anthropogenic emissions. Compared to the counterfactual between 2010 and 2013, the number of days on which O-3 (PM2.5) concentrations exceeded 60 ppb (12.0 mu gm(-3)) was reduced from 396 to 200 (1391 to 222).

Two of the satellite-derived inventories are estimated by using the DECSO (Daily Emission derived Constrained by Satellite Observations) algorithm, which is based on an extended Kalman filter applied to observations from OMI or from GOME-2. The other two are derived with the EnKF algorithm, which is based on an ensemble Kalman filter applied to observations of multiple species using either the chemical transport model CHASER and MIROC-chem.

The intercomparison of all inventories shows good agreement in total NOx emissions over mainland China, especially for trends, with an average bias of about 20% for yearly emissions. All the inventories show the typical emission reduction of 10% during the Chinese New Year and a peak in December. Satellite-derived approaches using OMI show a summer peak due to strong emissions from soil and biomass burning in this season. Biases in NOx emissions and uncertainties in temporal variability increase quickly when the spatial scale decreases. The analyses of the differences show the importance of using observations from multiple instruments and a high spatial resolution model for the satellite-derived inventories, while for bottom-up inventories, accurate emission factors and activity information are required. The advantage of the satellite-derived approach is that the emissions are soon available after observation, while the strength of the bottom-up inventories is that they include detailed information of emissions for each source category.",0,0,1.3.1.2.2,International Emissions of Ozone Precursors

Bachelor Observatory (MBO, 2.8 km asl) in central Oregon, USA, during 2004-2015. The seasonal cycle for O-3 showed a bimodal pattern with peaks in April and July, while aerosol scattering (asp) was lognormally distributed with a very high peak in August and a smaller peak in May. The mean O-3 concentrations showed positive and significant trends in all seasons except winter, with a slope of 0.6 -0.8 ppbv yr(-1). Monthly criteria for isolating free tropospheric (FT) and boundary layer influenced (BLI) air masses at MBO were obtained based on comparison of MBO water vapor (WV) distributions to those of Salem (SLE) and Medford (MFR), Oregon, at equivalent pressure level. In all seasons, FT O-3 was, on average, higher than BLI O-3, but the seasonal patterns were rather similar. For asp the FT mean in spring was higher, but the BLI mean in summer was significantly higher, indicating the importance of regional wildfire smoke.

To better understand the causes for the seasonal and interannual trends at MBO, we identified four major categories of air masses that impact O-3, carbon monoxide (CO) and aerosols: upper troposphere and lower stratosphere (UTLS) O-3 intrusion, Asian long-range transport (ALRT), Arctic air pollution (AAP) and plumes from the Pacific Northwest region (PNW). ALRT and PNW plumes can be further divided into wildfires (WF), industrial pollution (IP) and mineral dust (MD). Over the 12 years of observations, 177 individual plume events have been identified. Enhancement ratios (ERs) and Angstrom exponents (AEs) of aerosols were calculated for all events. The lowest slope of Delta sigma(sp)/O-3 is a unique feature of UTLS events. PNW-WF events have the highest averages for Delta sigma(sp)/Delta CO, Delta sigma(sp)/Delta O-3 and Delta sigma(sp)/Delta NOy compared to other events. These ERs decrease during long-range transport due to the shorter residence time of aerosols compared to the other pollutants. ALRT-WF events have lower absorption AEs (angstrom(ap)) than PNW-WF, implying that brown carbon (BrC) is generated from biomass burning but its fraction decreases during long-range transport. Signatures of ERs and AEs are useful tools to identify different plume categories.

We employed an approach recommended by the United States Environmental Protection Agency to allocate county-based emissions to model grid cells in 1 km and 4 km horizontal grid resolutions. The CMAQ Integrated Process Rate analyses showed a substantial difference in emissions contributions between 1 and 4 km grids but similar NOx and O-3 concentrations over urban and industrial locations. For example, the peak NOx emissions at an industrial and urban site differed by a factor of 20 for the 1 km and 8 for the 4 km grid, but simulated NOx concentrations changed only by a factor of 1.2 in both cases. Hence, due to the interplay of the atmospheric processes, we cannot expect a similar level of reduction of the gas-phase air pollutants as the reduction of emissions. Both simulations reproduced the variability of NASA P-3B aircraft measurements of NOy and O-3 in the lower atmosphere (from 90 m to 4.5 km). Both simulations provided similar reasonable predictions at surface, while 1 km case depicted more detailed features of emissions and concentrations in heavily polluted areas, such as highways, airports, and industrial regions, which are useful in understanding the major causes of O-3 pollution in such regions, and to quantify transport of O-3 to populated communities in urban areas. The Integrated Reaction Rate analyses indicated a distinctive difference of chemistry processes between the model surface layer and upper layers, implying that correcting the meteorological conditions at the surface may not help to enhance the O-3 predictions. The model-observation O-3 bias in our studies (e.g., large over -prediction during the nighttime or along Gulf of Mexico coastline), were due to uncertainties in meteorology, chemistry or other processes. Horizontal grid resolution is unlikely the major contributor to these biases. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

This study quantifies the impacts of ADEs on tropospheric ozone by using a two-way online coupled meteorology and atmospheric chemistry model, WRFCMAQ, using a process analysis methodology. Two manifestations of ADE impacts on O-3 including changes in atmospheric dynamics (Delta Dynamics) and changes in photolysis rates (Delta Photolysis) were assessed separately through multiple scenario simulations for January and July of 2013 over China. Results suggest that ADEs reduced surface daily maxima 1 h O-3 (DM1O(3)) in China by up to 39 mu gm(-)3 through the combination of Delta Dynamics and Delta Photolysis in January but enhanced surface DM1O(3) by up to 4 mu gm(-3) in July. Increased O-3 in July is largely attributed to 1 Dynamics, which causes a weaker O-3 sink of dry deposition and a stronger O-3 source of photochemistry due to the stabilization of the atmosphere. Meanwhile, surface OH is also enhanced at noon in July, though its daytime average values are reduced in January. An increased OH chain length and a shift towards more volatile organic compound (VOC)-limited conditions are found due to ADEs in both January and July. This study suggests that reducing ADEs may have the potential risk of increasing O-3 in winter, but it will benefit the reduction in maxima O-3 in summer.",0,0,1.6.2,Advances in Regional Chemical Transport Modeling

The changes induced by variations in meteorology and/or emissions are also evaluated during the same timeframe using spectral decomposition of observed and modeled ozone time series with the aim of identifying the underlying forcing mechanisms that control ozone exceedances and making informed recommendations for the optimal use of regional-scale air quality models. The evaluation is focused on the warm season's (i.e., May September) daily maximum 8-hr (DM8HR) ozone concentrations, the 4th highest (4th) and average of top 10 DM8HR ozone values (top10), as well as the spectrally-decomposed components of the DM8HR ozone time series using the Kolmogorov-Zurbenko (KZ) filter. Results of the dynamic evaluation are presented for six regions in the U.S., consistent with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAH) climatic regions. During the earlier 11-yr period (1990-2000), the simulated and observed regional average trends are not statistically significant. During the more recent 2000-2010 period, all observed trends are statistically significant and WRF-CMAQ captures the observed downward trend in the Southwest and Midwest but under -predicts the downward trends in observations for the other regions. Observational analysis reveals that it is the magnitude of the long-term forcing that dictates the maximum ozone exceedance potential; there is a strong linear relationship between the long-term forcing and the 4th highest or the average of the top10 ozone concentrations in both observations and model output. This finding indicates that improving the model's ability to reproduce the long-term component will also enable better simulation of ozone extreme values that are of interest to regulatory agencies.

Observations have shown that ozone (O-3) and fine particulate matter (PM2.5) in the US have declined since as early as 1980 in some areas. But observation trends alone cannot separate effects of changes in local and global emissions to US air quality which are important to air quality planners. This study uses a regional model (CAMx) nested within a global model (GEOS-Chem) to characterize regional changes in O-3 and PM2.5 due to the intercontinental transport and local/regional emissions representing six modeling years within five decades (1970-2020). We use the CAMx Source Apportionment Technology (OSAT/PSAT) to estimate contributions from 6 source sectors in 7 source regions plus 6 other groups for a total of 48 tagged contributions. On-road mobile sources consistently make the largest U.S. anthropogenic emissions contribution to O-3 in all cities examined even though they decline substantially from 1970 to 2005 and also from 2005 to 2020. Off-road mobile source contributions increase from 1970 to 2005 and then decrease after 2005 in all of the cities. The boundary conditions, mostly from intercontinental transport, contribute more than 20 ppb to high maximum daily 8-h average (MDA8) O-3 for all six years. We found that lowering NOx emissions raises O-3 formation efficiency (OFE) across all emission categories which will limit potential O-3 benefits of local NOx strategies in the near future. PM2.5 benefited from adoption of control devices between 1970 and 1980 and has continued to decline through 2005 and expected to decline further by 2020. Area sources such as residential, commercial and fugitive dust emissions stand out as making large contributions to PM2.5 that are not declining.

In this context, the role of iodide-mediated ozone (O3) deposition over seawater and marine halogen chemistry accounted for in both the lateral boundary conditions and coastal waters surrounding the continental U.S. is examined using the Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) model. Several nested simulations are conducted in which these halogen processes are implemented separately in the continental U.S. and hemispheric CMAQ domains, the latter providing lateral boundary conditions for the former. Overall, it is the combination of these processes within both the continental U.S. domain and from lateral boundary conditions that lead to the largest reductions in modeled surface O3concentrations. Predicted reductions in surface O3concentrations occur mainly along the coast where CMAQ typically has large overpredictions. These results suggest that a realistic representation of halogen processes in marine regions can improve model prediction of O3concentrations near the coast.",0,0,1.4.2,Halogen Chemistry

In this study, we investigate the skill in estimating ozone uptake in plants by the Weather Research and Forecasting model coupled with chemistry (WRF-Chem) V3.6.1, with the Wesely dry deposition scheme. To validate the stomatal uptake of ozone, the model simulations were compared with field measurements of three types of Mediterranean vegetation, over seven different periods representing various meteorological conditions. Some systematic biases in modelled ozone fluxes are revealed; the lack of an explicit and time varying dependency on plants' water availability results in overestimated daytime ozone stomatal fluxes particularly in dry periods. The optimal temperature in the temperature response function is likely too low for the woody species tested here. Also, too low nighttime stomatal conductance leads to underestimation of ozone uptake during night. We demonstrate that modelled stomatal ozone flux is improved by accounting for vapor pressure deficit in the ambient air. Based on the results of the overall comparison to measured fluxes, we propose that additional improvements to the stomatal conductance parameterization should be implemented before applying the modelling system for estimating ozone doses and potential damage to vegetation.

The time series of the derived NOxemissions was consistent with the bottom-up emission inventories for all power plants (r=0.8 on average), but not for some cities (r=0.4 on average).

The contribution of biogenic VOC (BVOC) emissions to regional ozone formation needs better quantification so that air quality regulators can effectively design emission control strategies. One of the key uncertainties for modeling BVOC emissions comes from the estimation of photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) reaching canopy. Satellite insolation retrieval data provide an alternative to prognostic meteorological models for representing the spatial and temporal variations of PAR. In this study, biogenic emission estimates generated with the MEGAN and BEIS biogenic emissions models using satellite or prognostic PAR are used to examine the contribution of BVOC to ozone in the United States. The Comprehensive Air Quality Model with Extensions (CAMx) is applied with Ozone Source Apportionment Technology (OSAT) and brute force zero-out sensitivity runs to quantify the biogenic contributions to ozone formation during May through September 2011. The satellite PAR retrievals are on average lower than modeled PAR and exhibit better agreement with SCAN and SURFRAD network measurements. Using satellite retrievals instead of modeled PAR reduces BEIS and MEGAN estimates of isoprene by an average of 3%-4% and 9%-12%, respectively. The simulations still overestimate observed ground-level isoprene concentrations by a factor of 1.1 for BEIS and 2.6 for MEGAN. The spatial pattern of biogenic ozone contribution diagnosed from OSAT differs from the brute force zero-out sensitivity results, with the former more smoothly distributed and the latter exhibiting peak impacts near metropolitan regions with intense anthropogenic NOR emissions. OSAT tends to apportion less ozone to biogenics as BVOC emissions increase, since that shifts marginal ozone formation toward more NOR-limited conditions. By contrast, zero-out source apportionment of ozone to biogenics increases with BVOC emissions. OSAT simulations with BEIS show that BVOCs typically contribute 10-19% to regional ozone concentrations at nonattainment receptor sites during episode days. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Among the major RON species, nitric acid (HNO3) is dominant (similar to 42-45 %), followed by NOx (31 %), total peroxy nitrates (Sigma PNs; 14 %), and total alkyl nitrates (Sigma ANs; 9-12 %) on a regional scale. We find that most RON species, including NOx, Sigma PNs, and HNO3, decline proportionally with decreasing NOx emissions in this region, leading to a similar decline in NOy. This linear response might be in part due to the nearly constant summertime supply of biogenic VOC emissions in this region. Our model captures the observed relative change in RON and surface ozone from 2004 to 2013.

Contrary to other wintertime Uinta Basin studies, predicted nitrogen oxides (NOx) were typically low compared to measurements. Increases to oil and gas VOC emissions resulted in O-3 predictions closer to observations, and nighttime O-3 improved when reducing the deposition velocity for all chemical species. Vertical structures of these pollutants were similar to observations on multiple days. However, the predicted surface layer VOC mixing ratios were generally found to be underestimated during the day and overestimated at night. While temperature profiles compared well to observations, WRF was found to have a warm temperature bias and too low nighttime mixing heights. Analyses of more realistic snow heat capacity in WRF to account for the warm bias and vertical mixing resulted in improved temperature profiles, although the improved temperature profiles seldom resulted in improved O-3 profiles.

For each office and location, annual simulations were performed with combinations of fixed ventilation ranging 20-100 CFM/occ (9.4-47 L/s/occ) and filters ranging in efficiency corresponding to MERV 8-16 and HEPA. Energy use was monetized using historic costs, and PM2.5 and ozone exposures were monetized using incidence valuations and concentration-response functions. These outcomes were combined into a singular cost function, which was characterized empirically as a fiinction of ventilation and filtration. Various partial derivatives of the cost function were calculated to observe trends and interdependencies. Exposure cost was 5.5 times higher than energy cost for cases with common filters (MERV 8-11). Even with high filter efficiency, exposure cost was greater than energy cost on average. Filtration had a much stronger effect than ventilation on indoor contaminant levels and the total cost function.

The strength of the association between two major modes of climate variability-the El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and the Northern Annular Mode (NAM)-and the amount of ozone contained in stratospheric intrusions are tested in the context of two mechanisms that modulate stratosphere-to-troposphere transport (STT) of ozone: (StratVarO(3)) the winter season buildup of ozone abundances in the lowermost stratosphere (LMS) and (JetVar) Pacific jet and wave breaking variability during spring. In essence, StratVarO(3) corresponds to variability in the amount of ozone per intrusion, while JetVar governs the frequency of intrusions. The resulting analysis, based on two different reanalysis products, suggests that StratVarO(3) is more important than JetVar for driving interannual variations in STT of ozone over the Pacific-North American region. In particular, the abundance of ozone in the LMS at the end of winter is shown to be a robust indicator of the amount of ozone that will be contained in stratospheric intrusions during the ensuing spring. Additionally, it is shown that the overall strength of the winter season stratospheric NAM is a useful predictor of ozone intrusion strength. The results also suggest a nuanced relationship between the phase of ENSO and STT of ozone. While ENSO-related jet variability is associated with STT variability, it is wave breaking frequency rather than typical ENSO teleconnection patterns that is responsible for the ENSO-STT relationship.",0,0,1.5.2,Interannual and Multidecadal Climate Variability

Data used in this study were gathered from continuous surface O-3 monitors for June-August 2013-2015 as well as additional flask measurements and mobile laboratories that were part of the FRAPPE/DISCOVER-AQ field campaign of July-August 2014. Overall observed O-3 levels during the summer of 2014 were lower than in 2013, likely due to cooler and damper weather than an average summer. This study determined the median hourly surface O-3 mixing ratio in the NFR on summer days with limited photochemical production to be approximately 45-55 ppb. Mobile laboratory and flask data collected on three days provide-representative case studies of different O-3 formation environments in and around Greeley, Colorado. Observations of several gases (including methane, ethane, CO, nitrous oxide) along with O-3 are used to identify sources of O-3 precursor emissions.

August 13 demonstrates high oil and gas emissions, low agricultural emissions, and CO measurements that were well correlated with ethane from oil and gas, suggesting an oil and gas related activity as a NOx and O-3 precursor source.

However, comparatively little research has been done regarding ozone reactions with human surfaces such as skin and clothing. Reaction characteristics of human surfaces and airflow around the human body may affect ozone removal and reaction byproduct formation. The objective of this study is to investigate effects of the reactivity of human surfaces, modeled for a range of reaction probabilities (gamma), on ozone deposition and reaction byproduct formation. Computational fluid dynamics models are verified and validated with previously published studies, and used to analyze ozone reaction dynamics due to human surfaces under varying indoor air flow conditions. The results show that for indoor environments with air exchange rate &lt; 5 h(-1), ozone deposition velocity is in the range of 8-10 m/h for human skin oil while it is 2-3 m/h for clean clothing. Surface reactivity of the human body has a larger influence on the ozone deposition velocity than do the air exchange rates or indoor airflow patterns. Modeled emission rates of major reaction byproducts from ozone chemistry with human surfaces included acetone (0.3 mg/h/person), decanal (0.2 mg/h/person), nonanal (0.1 mg/h/person) and 6-MHO (0.1 mg/h/person) for a transport-limited scenario with 90 ppb bulk ozone concentration.

While a suite of observations provides significant information on the spatial and temporal distribution of tropospheric ozone, observational gaps make it necessary to use global atmospheric chemistry models to synthesize our understanding of the processes and variables that control tropospheric ozone abundance and its variability. Models facilitate the interpretation of the observations and allow us to make projections of future tropospheric ozone and trace gas distributions for different anthropogenic or natural perturbations. This paper assesses the skill of current-generation global atmospheric chemistry models in simulating the observed present-day tropospheric ozone distribution, variability, and trends. Drawing upon the results of recent international multi-model intercomparisons and using a range of model evaluation techniques, we demonstrate that global chemistry models are broadly skillful in capturing the spatio-temporal variations of tropospheric ozone over the seasonal cycle, for extreme pollution episodes, and changes over interannual to decadal periods. However, models are consistently biased high in the northern hemisphere and biased low in the southern hemisphere, throughout the depth of the troposphere, and are unable to replicate particular metrics that define the longer term trends in tropospheric ozone as derived from some background sites. When the models compare unfavorably against observations, we discuss the potential causes of model biases and propose directions for future developments, including improved evaluations that may be able to better diagnose the root cause of the model-observation disparity. Overall, model results should be approached critically, including determining whether the model performance is acceptable for the problem being addressed, whether biases can be tolerated or corrected, whether the model is appropriately constituted, and whether there is a way to satisfactorily quantify the uncertainty.",0,0,1.8.2.4,Long Term Trends in U.S. Background (USB) and Baseline Ozone

These simulations provided boundary concentrations for base and natural background simulations with the Comprehensive Air Quality Model with Extensions (CAMx) on a North American domain (one-way nested) at 12 km x 12 km resolution over March-September 2010. The predicted maximum daily average 8 h (MDA8) background ozone for the US is largest in the mountainous areas of Colorado, New Mexico, Arizona, and California. The background MDA8 ozone in some of these locations exceeds 60 ppb, when averaged over the 10 days with the largest base-case ozone (T10base average). The background ozone generally becomes both a larger fraction of the base-case ozone in the western US and a smaller fraction in the eastern US when proceeding from spring to summer to the T10base average. The ozone difference between the base and background cases represents the increment to ozone from all anthropogenic sources. The path-integral method was applied to allocate this anthropogenic ozone increment to US anthropogenic emissions, Canadian/Mexican anthropogenic emissions, and the anthropogenic components of the lateral and top boundary concentrations (BCs). Using the T10base average MDA8 ozone, the relative importance of the sources is generally US emissions &gt; anthropogenic lateral BCs &gt; Canadian/Mexican emissions &gt;&gt; anthropogenic top BCs. Specifically, for 10 US urban areas, the source contributions were 12-53 ppb for US emissions, 3-9 ppb for lateral BCs, 0.2-3 ppb for Canadian/Mexican emissions, and &lt;= 0.1 ppb for top BCs. The contributions of the lateral BCs are largest for the higher-elevation US sites in the Intermountain West and along the western boundary of the domain. In Denver, for example, the lateral BCs contribute 44% to the T10base anthropogenic increment. Averaging over the 10 days in the background case with the largest MDA8 ozone (T10bkgd), the contribution from US emissions is reduced to 3-13 ppb at the 10 urban sites, leading to a reduction in the anthropogenic ozone increment. The contribution of the Canadian/Mexican emissions remains about the same (0.3-2 ppb), and the contribution from the lateral BCs increases (5-10 ppb), especially at the lower-elevation urban sites. The net effect at the urban sites is that the relative importance of the anthropogenic lateral BCs is significantly greater for the T10bkgd average than the T10base average. This is also true for rural sites studied, where the anthropogenic lateral BC contribution becomes as large as 68% of the anthropogenic increment for the T10bkgd average.

In this study, we use a 0-D photochemical box model to evaluate O-3 sensitivity and find that the relative rate of radical termination from radical-radical interactions to radical-NOx interactions (referred to as LROx/LNOx) provides a good indicator of maximum O-3 production along NOx ridgelines. Using airborne measurements from NASA's Deriving Information on Surface Conditions from Column and Vertically Resolved Observations Relative to Air Quality (DISCOVER-AQ) deployments in Colorado, Maryland, and Houston, we show that in situ measurements of CH2O/NO2 can be used to indicate O-3 sensitivity, but there is an important ""transition/ambiguous"" range whereby CH2O/NO2 fails to categorize O-3 sensitivity, and the range and span of this transition/ambiguous range varies regionally. Then, we apply these findings to aircraft-derived column density measurements from DISCOVER-AQ and find that inhomogeneities in vertical mixing in the lower troposphere further degrades the ability of column CH2O/NO2 to indicate near-surface O-3 sensitivity (i.e., the transition/ambiguous range is much larger than indicated by in situ data alone), and we hypothesize that the global transition/ambiguous range is sufficiently large to make the column CH2O/NO2 ratio unuseful for classifying near-surface O-3 sensitivity. Lastly, we present a case study from DISCOVER-AQ-Houston that suggests that O-3 sensitivity on exceedance days may be substantially different than on nonexceedance days (which may be observable from space) and explore the diurnal evolution of O-3 sensitivity, O-3 production, and the column CH2O/NO2 ratio.

Two standardized definitions homogeneously and unequivocally describing the impact of vertical filtering are recommended.
<br>
<br>The first proposed definition is based on the width of the response to a finite-impulse-type perturbation. The response is computed by convolving the filter coefficients with an impulse function, namely, a Kronecker delta function for smoothing filters, and a Heaviside step function for derivative filters. Once the response has been computed, the proposed standardized definition of vertical resolution is given by Delta z = delta z x H-FWHM, where delta z is the lidar's sampling resolution and H-FWHM is the full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the response, measured in sampling intervals.
<br>
<br>The second proposed definition relates to digital filtering theory. After applying a Laplace transform to a set of filter coefficients, the filter's gain characterizing the effect of the filter on the signal in the frequency domain is computed, from which the cut-off frequency f(C), defined as the frequency at which the gain equals 0.5, is computed. Vertical resolution is then defined by Delta z = delta z/(2f(C)). Unlike common practice in the field of spectral analysis, a factor 2 f(C) instead of f(C) is used here to yield vertical resolution values nearly equal to the values obtained with the impulse response definition using the same filter coefficients. When using either of the proposed definitions, unsmoothed signals yield the best possible vertical resolution Delta z = delta z (one sampling bin).
<br>
<br>Numerical tools were developed to support the implementation of these definitions across all NDACC lidar groups. The tools consist of ready-to-use ""plug-in"" routines written in several programming languages that can be inserted into any lidar data processing software and called each time a filtering operation occurs in the data processing chain.

Additionally, low-cost air quality sensors could be deployed to areas where limited monitoring exists. However, low-cost sensors are frequently sensitive to environmental conditions and pollutant cross-sensitivities, which have historically been poorly addressed by laboratory calibrations, limiting their utility for monitoring. In this study, we investigated different calibration models for the Real-time Affordable Multi-Pollutant (RAMP) sensor package, which measures CO, NO2, O-3, and CO2. We explored three methods: (1) laboratory univariate linear regression, (2) empirical multiple linear regression, and (3) machine-learning-based calibration models using random forests (RF). Calibration models were developed for 16-19 RAMP monitors (varied by pollutant) using training and testing windows spanning August 2016 through February 2017 in Pittsburgh, PA, US. The random forest models matched (CO) or significantly outperformed (NO2, CO2, O-3) the other calibration models, and their accuracy and precision were robust over time for testing windows of up to 16 weeks. Following calibration, average mean absolute error on the testing data set from the random forest models was 38 ppb for CO (14% relative error), 10 ppm for CO2 (2% relative error), 3.5 ppb for NO2 (29% relative error), and 3.4 ppb for O-3 (15% relative error), and Pearson r versus the reference monitors exceeded 0.8 for most units. Model performance is explored in detail, including a quantification of model variable importance, accuracy across different concentration ranges, and performance in a range of monitoring contexts including the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) and the US EPA Air Sensors Guidebook recommendations of minimum data quality for personal exposure measurement. A key strength of the RF approach is that it accounts for pollutant cross-sensitivities. This highlights the importance of developing multipollutant sensor packages (as opposed to single-pollutant monitors); we determined this is especially critical for NO2 and CO2. The evaluation reveals that only the RF-calibrated sensors meet the US EPA Air Sensors Guidebook recommendations of minimum data quality for personal exposure measurement. We also demonstrate that the RF-model-calibrated sensors could detect differences in NO2 concentrations between a near-road site and a suburban site less than 1.5 km away.

The development of regulatory emission control plans to meet air quality standards primarily relies on modeled projections of future-year air quality, although a weight of evidence approach (which takes into account a number of factors including modeling results, model evaluation and other pertinent information such as ambient trends) is recommended and is also typically used as part of the attainment demonstration. Thus, it is important to determine if the modeling system used to project future-year quality can correctly simulate ozone responses to the projected emissions reductions. Uncertainties and errors in modeled projections can lead to erroneous estimates of emissions controls required to attain the standards. We use two existing regulatory modeling databases, employed for forecasting future-year air quality in the South Coast Air Basin (SoCAB) of California, for a number of historical years to evaluate the ability of the system to accurately simulate the observed changes in air quality over a multi-year period. The evaluation results with the older (2012) database show that the modeling system consistently under-predicts the reductions in ozone in response to emission reductions over the years. Model response improves with the newer (2016) database with good agreement at some locations, but the system still tends to under-predict ozone responses by as much as a factor of 2 in recent years for the Basin maximum ozone design value. This suggests that future-year estimates of ozone design values may be overly conservative, resulting in emission controls that are technologically challenging or very expensive to implement. The development of better emission inventories and model inputs is recommended to develop a modeling system that more accurately responds to emission changes. Future regulatory planning should include dynamic evaluation in addition to the traditional operational evaluation of the model to provide more confidence to all stakeholders that the resulting policy decisions are necessary to attain the air quality standards and to protect public health.",0,0,1.6.2,Advances in Regional Chemical Transport Modeling

We identify this offset as the ODV due to the U.S. background ozone (i.e., the concentration that would be present if U.S. anthropogenic precursor emissions were reduced to zero) and is estimated to be 62.0 +/- 1.9 ppb in six of the basins. California's emission control efforts have reduced the anthropogenic ozone enhancements by a factor of similar to 5 since 1980. However, assuming that the current rate of exponential decrease is maintained and that U.S. background ODV remains constant, projections of the past decrease suggest that similar to 35 years of additional emission control efforts will be required to reach the new NAAQS of 70 ppb in the Los Angeles area. The growing predominance of U.S. background ozone contributions has shifted the maximum ozone concentrations in all air basins from later to earlier in the summer. Comparisons indicate that currently accepted model estimates of U.S. background ozone concentrations in Southern California are somewhat underestimated; thus, reducing ozone in this region to the 2015 NAAQS may be more difficult than currently expected.
<br>
<br>Plain Language Summary Over the past decades, ozone air quality in Southern California has been greatly improved, but the National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS) has not yet been achieved in much of the region. The ozone standard is based on the rare, highest recorded concentrations (similar to 98th percentile). A simple mathematical function is shown to provide an excellent description of the decrease in these ozone concentrations, which allows some implications to be inferred. Since 1980 the anthropogenic contribution to these concentrations has been reduced by a factor of similar to 5. However, the contribution of background ozone is estimated as similar to 89% of the NAAQS. Since this background contribution is so large, projection of the past rate of decrease of the anthropogenic contribution into the future suggests that similar to 35 years of additional emission control efforts will be required to reach the new NAAQS of 70 ppb in the Los Angeles region. The model calculations of the background ozone contribution that were considered in the formulation of the new NAAQS underestimate the background contribution. Thus, reducing Southern California ozone concentrations to the NAAQS may be more difficult than currently expected.",0,0,1.8.1.4,Other Approaches for Estimating Background Ozone

However, obtaining in situ measurements of convection and convective transport is difficult and such observations are historically rare. Modeling studies, on the other hand, offer the advantage of providing output related to the physical, dynamical, and chemical characteristics of storms and their environments at fine spatial and temporal scales. Since these characteristics of simulated convection depend on the chosen model design, we examine the sensitivity of simulated convective transport to the choice of physical (bulk microphysics or BMP and planetary boundary layer or PBL) and chemical parameterizations in the Weather Research and Forecasting model coupled with Chemistry (WRF-Chem). In particular, we simulate multiple cases where in situ observations are available from the recent (2012) Deep Convective Clouds and Chemistry (DC3) experiment. Model output is evaluated using ground-based radar observations of each storm and in situ trace gas observations from two aircraft operated during the DC3 experiment. Model results show measurable sensitivity of the physical characteristics of a storm and the transport of water vapor and additional trace gases into the UTLS to the choice of BMP. The physical characteristics of the storm and transport of insoluble trace gases are largely insensitive to the choice of PBL scheme and chemical mechanism, though several soluble trace gases (e.g., SO2,CH2O, and HNO3) exhibit some measurable sensitivity.",0,0,1.6.2,Advances in Regional Chemical Transport Modeling

However, recent studies disagree on the overall sign of the impacts of halogens on the oxidising capacity of the troposphere. We present simulations of OH and HO2 radicals for comparison with observations made in the remote tropical ocean boundary layer during the Seasonal Oxidant Study at the Cape Verde Atmospheric Observatory in 2009. We use both a constrained box model, using detailed chemistry derived from the Master Chemical Mechanism (v3.2), and the three-dimensional global chemistry transport model GEOS-Chem. Both model approaches reproduce the diurnal trends in OH and HO2. Absolute observed concentrations are well reproduced by the box model but are overpredicted by the global model, potentially owing to incomplete consideration of oceanic sourced radical sinks. The two models, however, differ in the impacts of halogen chemistry. In the box model, halogen chemistry acts to increase OH concentrations (by 9.8% at midday at the Cape Verde Atmospheric Observatory), while the global model exhibits a small increase in OH at the Cape Verde Atmospheric Observatory (by 0.6% at midday) but overall shows a decrease in the global annual mass-weighted mean OH of 4.5 %. These differences reflect the variety of timescales through which the halogens impact the chemical system. On short timescales, photolysis of HOBr and HOI, produced by reactions of HO2 with BrO and IO, respectively, increases the OH concentration. On longer timescales, halogen-catalysed ozone destruction cycles lead to lower primary production of OH radicals through ozone photolysis, and thus to lower OH concentrations. The global model includes more of the longer timescale responses than the constrained box model, and overall the global impact of the longer timescale response (reduced primary production due to lower O-3 concentrations) overwhelms the shorter timescale response (enhanced cycling from HO2 to OH), and thus the global OH concentration decreases. The Earth system contains many such responses on a large range of timescales.

The Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) model simulations supporting this analysis were performed over the continental US for the year 2010 within the context of the Air Quality Model Evaluation International Initiative (AQMEII) and Task Force on Hemispheric Transport of Air Pollution (TF-HTAP) activities. CMAQ process analysis (PA) results highlight the dominant role of horizontal and vertical advection on the ozone burden in the mid-to-upper troposphere and lower stratosphere. Vertical mixing, including mixing by convective clouds, couples fluctuations in free-tropospheric ozone to ozone in lower layers. Hypothetical bounding scenarios were performed to quantify the effects of emissions, boundary conditions, and ozone dry deposition on the simulated ozone burden. Analysis of these simulations confirms that the characterization of ozone outside the regional-scale modeling domain can have a profound impact on simulated regional-scale ozone. This was further investigated by using data from four hemispheric or global modeling systems (Chemistry - Integrated Forecasting Model (C-IFS), CMAQ extended for hemispheric applications (H-CMAQ), the Goddard Earth Observing System model coupled to chemistry (GEOS-Chem), and AM3) to derive alternate boundary conditions for the regional-scale CMAQ simulations. The regional-scale CMAQ simulations using these four different boundary conditions showed that the largest ozone abundance in the upper layers was simulated when using boundary conditions from GEOS-Chem, followed by the simulations using C-IFS, AM3, and H-CMAQ boundary conditions, consistent with the analysis of the ozone fields from the global models along the CMAQ boundaries. Using boundary conditions from AM3 yielded higher springtime ozone columns burdens in the middle and lower troposphere compared to boundary conditions from the other models. For surface ozone, the differences between the AM3-driven CMAQ simulations and the CMAQ simulations driven by other large-scale models are especially pronounced during spring and winter where they can reach more than 10 ppb for seasonal mean ozone mixing ratios and as much as 15 ppb for domain-averaged daily maximum 8 h average ozone on individual days. In contrast, the differences between the C-IFS-, GEOS-Chem-, and H-CMAQ-driven regional-scale CMAQ simulations are typically smaller. Comparing simulated surface ozone mixing ratios to observations and computing seasonal and regional model performance statistics revealed that boundary conditions can have a substantial impact on model performance. Further analysis showed that boundary conditions can affect model performance across the entire range of the observed distribution, although the impacts tend to be lower during summer and for the very highest observed percentiles.

This relevance, due to a shorter atmospheric lifetime and a stronger warming potential than carbon dioxide, is challenged by the still unexplained changes of atmospheric CH4 over the past decade. Emissions and concentrations of CH4 are continuing to increase, making CH4 the second most important human-induced greenhouse gas after carbon dioxide. Two major difficulties in reducing uncertainties come from the large variety of diffusive CH4 sources that overlap geographically, and from the destruction of CH4 by the very short-lived hydroxyl radical (OH). To address these difficulties, we have established a consortium of multi-disciplinary scientists under the umbrella of the Global Carbon Project to synthesize and stimulate research on the methane cycle, and producing regular (similar to biennial) updates of the global methane budget. This consortium includes atmospheric physicists and chemists, biogeochemists of surface and marine emissions, and socio-economists who study anthropogenic emissions. Following Kirschke et al. (2013), we propose here the first version of a living review paper that integrates results of top-down studies (exploiting atmospheric observations within an atmospheric inverse-modelling framework) and bottom-up models, inventories and data-driven approaches (including process-based models for estimating land surface emissions and atmospheric chemistry, and inventories for anthropogenic emissions, data-driven extrapolations).
<br>
<br>For the 2003-2012 decade, global methane emissions are estimated by top-down inversions at 558 TgCH(4) yr(-1), range 540-568. About 60% of global emissions are anthropogenic (range 50-65 %). Since 2010, the bottom-up global emission inventories have been closer to methane emissions in the most carbon-intensive Representative Concentrations Pathway (RCP8.5) and higher than all other RCP scenarios. Bottom-up approaches suggest larger global emissions (736 TgCH(4) yr(-1), range 596-884) mostly because of larger natural emissions from individual sources such as inland waters, natural wetlands and geological sources. Considering the atmospheric constraints on the top-down budget, it is likely that some of the individual emissions reported by the bottom-up approaches are overestimated, leading to too large global emissions. Latitudinal data from top-down emissions indicate a predominance of tropical emissions (similar to 64% of the global budget, <30 degrees N) as compared to mid (similar to 32 %, 30-60 degrees N) and high northern latitudes (similar to 4 %, 60-90 degrees N). Top-down inversions consistently infer lower emissions in China (similar to 58 TgCH(4) yr(-1), range 51-72, -14 %) and higher emissions in Africa (86 TgCH(4) yr(-1), range 73-108, + 19 %) than bottom-up values used as prior estimates. Overall, uncertainties for anthropogenic emissions appear smaller than those from natural sources, and the uncertainties on source categories appear larger for top-down inversions than for bottom-up inventories and models.
<br>
<br>The most important source of uncertainty on the methane budget is attributable to emissions from wetland and other inland waters. We show that the wetland extent could contribute 30-40% on the estimated range for wetland emissions. Other priorities for improving the methane budget include the following: (i) the development of process-based models for inland-water emissions, (ii) the intensification of methane observations at local scale (flux measurements) to constrain bottom-up land surface models, and at regional scale (surface networks and satellites) to constrain top-down inversions, (iii) improvements in the estimation of atmospheric loss by OH, and (iv) improvements of the transport models integrated in top-down inversions.

Using aircraft observations from the Colorado Front Range, we demonstrate that TES can be sensitive to elevated PAN in the boundary layer (similar to 750 hPa) even in the presence of clouds. In situ observations have shown that wildfire emissions can rapidly produce PAN, and PAN decomposition is an important component of ozone production in smoke plumes. We identify smoke-impacted TES PAN retrievals by co-location with NOAA Hazard Mapping System (HMS) smoke plumes. Depending on the year, 15-32% of cases where elevated PAN is identified in TES observations (retrievals with degrees of freedom (DOF) > 0.6) overlap smoke plumes during July. Of all the retrievals attempted in the July 2006 to July 2009 study period, 18% is associated with smoke. A case study of smoke transport in July 2007 illustrates that PAN enhancements associated with HMS smoke plumes can be connected to fire complexes, providing evidence that TES is sufficiently sensitive to measure elevated PAN several days downwind of major fires. Using a subset of retrievals with TES 510 hPa carbon monoxide (CO) > 150 ppbv, and multiple estimates of background PAN, we calculate enhancement ratios for tropospheric average PAN relative to CO in smoke-impacted retrievals.

We derive ambient and modeled CO:NOy ratios that have previously been interpreted to represent CO:NOy ratios in emissions from local sources. Modeled and measured CO:NOy are similar; however, measured CO:NOy has much more daily variability than modeled values. Sector-based tagging shows that regional transport, on-road gasoline vehicles, and nonroad equipment are the major contributors to modeled CO mixing ratios in the Baltimore area. In addition to those sources, on-road diesel vehicles, soil emissions, and power plants also contribute substantially to modeled NOy in the area. The sector mix is important because emitted CO:NOx ratios vary by several orders of magnitude among the emission sources. The model-predicted gasoline/diesel split remains constant across all measurement locations in this study. Comparison of CO:NOy to emitted CO:NOy is challenged by ambient and modeled evidence that free tropospheric entrainment, and atmospheric processing elevates ambient CO:NOy above emitted ratios. Specifically, modeled CO:NOy from tagged mobile source emissions is enhanced 5-50% above the emitted ratios at times and locations of aircraft measurements. We also find a correlation between ambient formaldehyde concentrations and measured CO:NOy suggesting that secondary CO formation plays a role in these elevated ratios.

Results from these methods may differ substantially, which can affect the outcomes of health impact assessments. Here, we applied 14 methods for developing spatiotemporal air pollutant concentration fields of eight pollutants to the Atlanta, Georgia region. These methods include eight methods relying mostly on air quality observations (CM: central monitor; SA: spatial average; IDW: inverse distance weighting; KRIG: kriging; TESS-D: discontinuous tessellation; TESS-NN: natural neighbor tessellation with interpolation; LUR: land use regression; AOD: downscaled satellite-derived aerosol optical depth), one using the RUNE dispersion model, and five methods using a chemical transport model (CMAQ), with and without using observational data to constrain results. The derived fields were evaluated and compared. Overall, all methods generally perform better at urban than rural area, and for secondary than primary pollutants. We found the CM and SA methods may be appropriate only for small domains, and for secondary pollutants, though the SA method lead to large negative spatial correlations when using data withholding for PM2.5 (spatial correlation coefficient R = -0.81). The TESS-D method was found to have major limitations. Results of the IDW, KRIG and TESS-NN methods are similar. They are found to be better suited for secondary pollutants because of their satisfactory temporal performance (e.g. average temporal R-2 > 0.85 for PM2.5 but less than 0.35 for primary pollutant NO2). In addition, they are suitable for areas with relatively dense monitoring networks due to their inability to capture spatial concentration variabilities, as indicated by the negative spatial R (lower than -0.2 for PM2.5 when assessed using data withholding). The performance of LUR and AOD methods were similar to kriging. Using RUNE and CMAQ fields without fusing observational data led to substantial errors and biases, though the CMAQ model captured spatial gradients reasonably well (spatial R = 0.45 for PM2.5). Two unique tests conducted here included quantifying autocorrelation of method biases (which can be important in time series analyses) and how well the methods capture the observed interspecies correlations (which would be of particular importance in multipollutant health assessments). Autocorrelation of method biases lasted longest and interspecies correlations of primary pollutants was higher than observations when air quality models were used without data fusing.

The ISA, in conjunction with additional technical and policy assessments, provides the scientific basis for EPA?s decisions on the adequacy of the current NAAQS and the appropriateness of possible alternative standards. 

Oxides of nitrogen, oxides of sulfur, and particulate matter are three of six criteria pollutants for which EPA has established NAAQS. Periodically, EPA reviews the scientific basis for these standards by preparing an ISA (formerly called an Air Quality Criteria Document). The ISA, in conjunction with additional technical and policy assessments, provides the scientific basis for EPA?s decisions on the adequacy of the current NAAQS and the appropriateness of possible alternative standards. The intent of the ISA, as described in the Clean Air Act, is to 'accurately reflect the latest scientific knowledge expected from the presence of [a] pollutant in ambient air.' It includes scientific research from atmospheric sciences, exposure and deposition, biogeochemistry, hydrology, soil science, marine science, plant physiology, animal physiology, and ecology conducted at multiple scales (e.g., population, community, ecosystem, landscape levels). 

Key information and judgments formerly found in the AQCDs for oxides of sulfur, oxides of nitrogen and particulate matter for ecological effects are included; appendices provide additional details supporting the ISA. Together, the ISA and appendices serve to update and revise the last oxides of nitrogen and oxides of sulfur ISA which was published in 2008 and the ecological portion of the last particulate matter ISA, which was published in 2009.

Additionally, the Clean Air Scientific Advisory Committee (CASAC) is an independent science advisory committee whose review and advisory functions are mandated by Section 109(d)(2) of the Clean Air Act, and charged (among other things) with performing an independent scientific review of all the EPA?s air quality criteria.",0,0,1.3.1.1.1,U.S. Anthropogenic Nitrogen Oxides (NOX)

Effects of exposure to low concentrations of ozone on respiratory and cardiovascular outcomes),"Frampton, MW; Balmes, JR; Bromberg, PA; Stark, P; Arjomandi, M; Hazucha, MJ; Rich, DQ; Hollenbeck-Pringle, D; Dagincourt, N; Alexis, N; Ganz, P; Zareba, W; Costantini, MG",2017,"<strong>INTRODUCTION: </strong>Exposure to air pollution is a well-established risk factor for cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Most of the evidence supporting an association between air pollution and adverse cardiovascular effects involves exposure to particulate matter (PM). To date, little attention has been paid to acute cardiovascular responses to ozone, in part due to the notion that ozone causes primarily local effects on lung function, which are the basis for the current ozone National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS). There is evidence from a few epidemiological studies of adverse health effects of chronic exposure to ambient ozone, including increased risk of mortality from cardiovascular disease. However, in contrast to the well-established association between ambient ozone and various nonfatal adverse respiratory effects, the observational evidence for impacts of acute (previous few days) increases in ambient ozone levels on total cardiovascular mortality and morbidity is mixed.<br /><br /> Ozone is a prototypic oxidant gas that reacts with constituents of the respiratory tract lining fluid to generate reactive oxygen species (ROS) that can overwhelm antioxidant defenses and cause local oxidative stress. Pathways by which ozone could cause cardiovascular dysfunction include alterations in autonomic balance, systemic inflammation, and oxidative stress. These initial responses could lead ultimately to arrhythmias, endothelial dysfunction, acute arterial vasoconstriction, and procoagulant activity. Individuals with impaired antioxidant defenses, such as those with the null variant of glutathione S-transferase mu 1 (GSTM1), may be at increased risk for acute health effects.<br /><br /> The Multicenter Ozone Study in oldEr Subjects (MOSES) was a controlled human exposure study designed to evaluate whether short-term exposure of older, healthy individuals to ambient levels of ozone induces acute cardiovascular responses. The study was designed to test the a priori hypothesis that short-term exposure to ambient levels of ozone would induce acute cardiovascular responses through the following mechanisms: autonomic imbalance, systemic inflammation, and development of a prothrombotic vascular state. We also postulated a priori the confirmatory hypothesis that exposure to ozone would induce airway inflammation, lung injury, and lung function decrements. Finally, we postulated the secondary hypotheses that ozone-induced acute cardiovascular responses would be associated with: (a) increased systemic oxidative stress and lung effects, and (b) the GSTM1-null genotype.<br /><br /><strong>METHODS: </strong>The study was conducted at three clinical centers with a separate Data Coordinating and Analysis Center (DCAC) using a common protocol. All procedures were approved by the institutional review boards (IRBs) of the participating centers. Healthy volunteers 55 to 70 years of age were recruited. Consented participants who successfully completed the screening and training sessions were enrolled in the study. All three clinical centers adhered to common standard operating procedures (SOPs) and used common tracking and data forms. Each subject was scheduled to participate in a total of 11 visits: screening visit, training visit, and three sets of exposure visits, each consisting of the pre-exposure day, the exposure day, and the post-exposure day. The subjects spent the night in a nearby hotel the night of the pre-exposure day.<br /><br /> On exposure days, the subjects were exposed for three hours in random order to 0 ppb ozone (clean air), 70 ppb ozone, and 120 ppm ozone, alternating 15 minutes of moderate exercise with 15 minutes of rest. A suite of cardiovascular and pulmonary endpoints was measured on the day before, the day of, and up to 22 hours after, each exposure. The endpoints included: (1) electrocardiographic changes (continuous Holter monitoring: heart rate variability [HRV], repolarization, and arrhythmia); (2) markers of inflammation and oxidative stress (C-reactive protein [CRP], interleukin-6 [IL-6], 8-isoprostane, nitrotyrosine, and P-selectin); (3) vascular function measures (blood pressure [BP], flow-mediated dilatation [FMD] of the brachial artery, and endothelin-1 [ET-1]; (4) venous blood markers of platelet activation, thrombosis, and microparticle-associated tissue factor activity (MP-TFA); (5) pulmonary function (spirometry); (6) markers of airway epithelial cell injury (increases in plasma club cell protein 16 [CC16] and sputum total protein); and (7) markers of lung inflammation in sputum (polymorphonuclear leukocytes [PMN], IL-6, interleukin-8 [IL-8], and tumor necrosis factor-alpha [TNF-?]). Sputum was collected only at 22 hours after exposure.<br /><br /> The analyses of the continuous electrocardiographic monitoring, the brachial artery ultrasound (BAU) images, and the blood and sputum samples were carried out by core laboratories. The results of all analyses were submitted directly to the DCAC.<br /><br /> The variables analyzed in the statistical models were represented as changes from pre-exposure to post-exposure (post-exposure minus pre-exposure). Mixed-effect linear models were used to evaluate the impact of exposure to ozone on the prespecified primary and secondary continuous outcomes. Site and time (when multiple measurements were taken) were controlled for in the models. Three separate interaction models were constructed for each outcome: ozone concentration by subject sex; ozone concentration by subject age; and ozone concentration by subject GSTM1 status (null or sufficient). Because of the issue of multiple comparisons, the statistical significance threshold was set a priori at P < 0.01.<br /><br /><strong>RESULTS: </strong>Subject recruitment started in June 2012, and the first subject was randomized on July 25, 2012. Subject recruitment ended on December 31, 2014, and testing of all subjects was completed by April 30, 2015. A total of 87 subjects completed all three exposures. The mean age was 59.9 ? 4.5 years, 60% of the subjects were female, 88% were white, and 57% were GSTM1 null. Mean baseline body mass index (BMI), BP, cholesterol (total and low-density lipoprotein), and lung function were all within the normal range.<br /><br /> We found no significant effects of ozone exposure on any of the primary or secondary endpoints for autonomic function, repolarization, ST segment change, or arrhythmia. Ozone exposure also did not cause significant changes in the primary endpoints for systemic inflammation (CRP) and vascular function (systolic blood pressure [SBP] and FMD) or secondary endpoints for systemic inflammation and oxidative stress (IL-6, P-selectin, and 8-isoprostane). Ozone did cause changes in two secondary endpoints: a significant increase in plasma ET-1 (P = 0.008) and a marginally significant decrease in nitrotyrosine (P = 0.017). Lastly, ozone exposure did not affect the primary prothrombotic endpoints (MP-TFA and monocyte-platelet conjugate count) or any secondary markers of prothrombotic vascular status (platelet activation, circulating microparticles [MPs], von Willebrand factor [vWF], or fibrinogen.).<br /><br /> Although our hypothesis focused on possible acute cardiovascular effects of exposure to low levels of ozone, we recognized that the initial effects of inhaled ozone involve the lower airways. Therefore, we looked for: (a) changes in lung function, which are known to occur during exposure to ozone and are maximal at the end of exposure; and (b) markers of airway injury and inflammation. We found an increase in forced vital capacity (FVC) and forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV?) after exposure to 0 ppb ozone, likely due to the effects of exercise. The FEV? increased significantly 15 minutes after 0 ppb exposure (85 mL; 95% confidence interval [CI], 64 to 106; P < 0.001), and remained significantly increased from pre-exposure at 22 hours (45 mL; 95% CI, 26 to 64; P < 0.001). The increase in FVC followed a similar pattern. The increase in FEV? and FVC were attenuated in a dose-response manner by exposure to 70 and 120 ppb ozone. We also observed a significant ozone-induced increase in the percentage of sputum PMN 22 hours after exposure at 120 ppb compared to 0 ppb exposure (P = 0.003). Plasma CC16 also increased significantly after exposure to 120 ppb (P < 0.001). Sputum IL-6, IL-8, and TNF-? concentrations were not significantly different after ozone exposure. We found no significant interactions with sex, age, or GSTM1 status regarding the effect of ozone on lung function, percentage of sputum PMN, or plasma CC16.<br /><br /><strong>CONCLUSIONS: </strong>In this multicenter clinical study of older healthy subjects, ozone exposure caused concentration-related reductions in lung function and presented evidence for airway inflammation and injury. However, there was no convincing evidence for effects on cardiovascular function. Blood levels of the potent vasoconstrictor, ET-1, increased with ozone exposure (with marginal statistical significance), but there were no effects on BP, FMD, or other markers of vascular function. Blood levels of nitrotyrosine decreased with ozone exposure, the opposite of our hypothesis. Our study does not support acute cardiovascular effects of low-level ozone exposure in healthy older subjects. Inclusion of only healthy older individuals is a major limitation, which may affect the generalizability of our findings. We cannot exclude the possibility of effects with higher ozone exposure concentrations or more prolonged exposure, or the possibility that subjects with underlying vascular disease, such as hypertension or diabetes, would show effects under these conditions.",0,0,3.1.4.1.1,Controlled Human Exposure Studies

In the U.S., the Clean Air Act (CAA) regulates O-3 levels to protect public health and welfare, but unraveling the origins of surface O-3 is complicated by the presence of contributions from multiple sources including background sources like stratospheric transport, wildfires, biogenic precursors, and international anthropogenic pollution, in addition to U.S. anthropogenic sources. In this report, we consider more than 100 published studies and assess current knowledge on the spatial and temporal distribution, trends, and sources of background O-3 over the continental U.S., and evaluate how it influences attainment of the air quality standards. We conclude that spring and summer seasonal mean U.S. background O-3 (USB O-3), or O-3 formed from natural sources plus anthropogenic sources in countries outside the U.S., is greatest at high elevation locations in the western U.S., with monthly mean maximum daily 8- hour average (MDA8) mole fractions approaching 50 parts per billion (ppb) and annual 4th highest MDA8s exceeding 60 ppb, at some locations. At lower elevation sites, e.g., along the West and East Coasts, seasonal mean MDA8 USB O-3 is in the range of 20- 40 ppb, with generally smaller contributions on the highest O-3 days. The uncertainty in U.S. background O-3 is around +/- 10 ppb for seasonal mean values and higher for individual days. Noncontrollable O-3 sources, such as stratospheric intrusions or precursors from wildfires, can make significant contributions to O-3 on some days, but it is challenging to quantify accurately these contributions. We recommend enhanced routine observations, focused field studies, processoriented modeling studies, and greater emphasis on the complex photochemistry in smoke plumes as key steps to reduce the uncertainty associated with background O-3 in the U.S.",0,0,1.2.2.3,U.S. Background (USB) Averaging Time

It is not well known, however, how much error in O-3 predictions can be directly attributed to error in cloud predictions. This study applies the Weather Research and Forecasting with Chemistry (WRF-Chem) model at 12 km horizontal resolution with the Morrison microphysics and Grell 3-D cumulus parameterization to quantify uncertainties in summertime surface O-3 predictions associated with cloudiness over the contiguous United States (CONUS). All model simulations are driven by reanalysis of atmospheric data and reinitialized every 2 days. In sensitivity simulations, cloud fields used for photochemistry are corrected based on satellite cloud retrievals. The results show that WRF-Chem predicts about 55% of clouds in the right locations and generally underpredicts cloud optical depths. These errors in cloud predictions can lead to up to 60 ppb of overestimation in hourly surface O-3 concentrations on some days. The average difference in summertime surface O-3 concentrations derived from the modeled clouds and satellite clouds ranges from 1 to 5 ppb for maximum daily 8 h average O-3 (MDA8 O-3) over the CONUS. This represents up to similar to 40% of the total MDA8 O-3 bias under cloudy conditions in the tested model version. Surface O3 concentrations are sensitive to cloud errors mainly through the calculation of photolysis rates (for similar to 80 %), and to a lesser extent to light-dependent BVOC emissions. The sensitivity of surface O-3 concentrations to satellite-based cloud corrections is about 2 times larger in VOC-limited than NOx-limited regimes. Our results suggest that the benefits of accurate predictions of cloudiness would be significant in VOC-limited regions, which are typical of urban areas.",0,0,1.6.2,Advances in Regional Chemical Transport Modeling

Using a suite of sensitivity simulations in the GEOS-Chem global chemistry transport model, we estimate the influence from individual background sources versus US anthropogenic sources on total surface O-3 over 10 continental US regions from 2004 to 2012. Evaluation with observations reveals model biases of +0-19 ppb in seasonal mean maximum daily 8 h average (MDA8) O-3, highest in summer over the eastern USA. Simulated high-O-3 events cluster too late in the season. We link these model biases to excessive regional O-3 production (e.g., US anthropogenic, biogenic volatile organic compounds (BVOCs), and soil NOx, emissions), or coincident missing sinks. On the 10 highest observed O-3 days during summer (O-3_top10obs_JJA), US anthropogenic emissions enhance O-3 by 5-11 ppb and by less than 2 ppb in the eastern versus western USA. The O-3 enhancement from BVOC emissions during summer is 1-7 ppb higher on O-3_top10obs_JJA days than on average days, while intercontinental pollution is up to 2 ppb higher on average versus on O-3_top10obs_JJA days. During the summers of 2004-2012, monthly regional mean US background O-3 MDA8 levels vary by up to 15 ppb from year to year. Observed and simulated summertime total surface O-3 levels on O-3_top10obs_JJA days decline by 3 ppb (averaged over all regions) from 2004-2006 to 2010-2012, reflecting rising US background (+2 ppb) and declining US anthropogenic O-3 emissions (-6 ppb) in the model. The model attributes interannual variability in US background O-3 on O-3_top10obs days to natural sources, not international pollution transport.

Here we compare the transport of idealized tracers in several different models that use the same meteorological fields taken from Modern-Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications (MERRA). We show that, even though the models use the same meteorological fields, there are substantial differences in their global-scale tropospheric transport related to large differences in parameterized convection between the simulations. Furthermore, we find that the transport differences between simulations constrained with the same-large scale flow are larger than differences between free-running simulations, which have differing large-scale flow but much more similar convective mass fluxes.

We describe a statistical transfer approach that bridges the spatial gap between air quality projections, averaged over four broad U.S. regions, from a global chemistry-climate model and the local level (at specific U.S. CASTNet sites). Our site-level projections are intended as a line of evidence in planning for possible futures rather than the sole basis for policy decisions. We use a set of transient sensitivity simulations (2006-2100) from the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory (GFDL) chemistry-climate model CM3, designed to isolate the effects of changes in anthropogenic ozone (O-3) precursor emissions, climate warming, and global background CH4 on surface O-3. We find that surface maximum daily 8-h average (MDA8) O-3 increases despite constant precursor emissions in a warmer climate during summer, particularly in the low tail of the MDA8 O-3 distribution for the Northeastern U.S., while MDA8 O-3 decreases slightly throughout the distribution over the West and Southeast during summer and fall. Under scenarios in which non-methane O-3 precursors decline as climate warms (RCP4.5 and RCP8.5), summertime MDA8 O-3 decreases with NOx emissions, most strongly in the upper tail of the MDA8 O-3 distribution. In a scenario where global methane abundances roughly double over the 21st century (RCP8.5), winter and spring MDA8 O-3 increases, particularly in the lower tail and over the Western U.S. In this RCP8.5 scenario, the number of days when MDA8 O-3 exceeds 70 ppb declines in summer with NOx emissions, but increases in spring (and winter); by the end of the century, the majority of sites in the WE and NE show probabilistic return values of the annual 4th highest MDA8 O-3 concentration above 70 ppb (the current O-3 NAAQS level).

Distinct geographic variability occurred in the proportion of fires and area burned attributed to lightning, with a majority of fires in the interior western US attributed to lightning. Lightning ignition efficiency was highest across the western portion of the region due to the concomitance of peak lightning frequency and annual nadir in fuel moisture in mid-to-late summer. For most regions the number of total and dry lightning strikes exhibited strong interannual correlation with the number of lightning-caused fires, yet were a poor predictor of area burned at regional scales.

As a consequence, the emissions of major air pollutants have decreased and the air quality has substantially improved. Here, we quantified China's anthropogenic emission trends from 2010 to 2017 and identified the major driving forces of these trends by using a combination of bottom-up emission inventory and index decomposition analysis (IDA) approaches. The relative change rates of China's anthropogenic emissions during 2010?2017 are estimated as follows: ?62?% for SO2, ?17?% for NOx, +11?% for nonmethane volatile organic compounds (NMVOCs), +1?% for NH3, ?27?% for CO, ?38?% for PM10, ?35?% for PM2.5, ?27?% for BC, ?35?% for OC, and +16?% for CO2. The IDA results suggest that emission control measures are the main drivers of this reduction, in which the pollution controls on power plants and industries are the most effective mitigation measures. The emission reduction rates markedly accelerated after the year 2013, confirming the effectiveness of China's Clean Air Action that was implemented since 2013.

This has been incorporated into ecosystem models but not tested experimentally and remains an important uncertainty for understanding potential hotspots of reactive N emissions: poorly drained agricultural soils that experience episodically high moisture following intensive fertilization. We incubated soils at moisture ranging from 44% to 100% water-filled pore space (WFPS). Counter to HIP, we did not observe a consistent trade-off in NO and N2O emissions at intermediate moisture levels following fertilization, and prefertilization emissions were low. Emissions of N as N2O exceeded NO by 2-200-fold at all moisture levels and peaked at 73-82% WFPS. Emissions of NO declined with moisture but remained significant even under saturated conditions. Increases in nitrite and reduced iron at high moisture indicated possible NO production from chemodenitrification. Potential nitrification rates were 100-1,000-fold greater than potential denitrification. Emission factors for fertilizer N ranged from 0.05% to 0.58% (mean=0.2%) for NO and from 0.4% to 16.9% (mean=5.3%) for N2O. Our results caution the use of WFPS to predict NO:N2O emission ratios as often employed in ecosystem models. Subsurface N cycling may suppress emissions of NO relative to N2O, and N2O emissions can persist under saturated conditions. Elevated N2O emissions from in-field wet spots comprising a small landscape extent could potentially address disparities between top-down and bottom-up N2O budgets. Plain Language Summary Nitric oxide and nitrous oxide are environmentally harmful gases: they contribute to climate change, the loss of good ozone high in the atmosphere that protects us from damaging sunlight, and the production of bad ozone that pollutes our air. The activities of microorganisms in soils are important sources of these gases to the atmosphere, and fertilized agricultural soils have particularly high emissions. Conceptual and mathematical models are often used to predict how nitrous and nitric oxide emissions respond to environmental changes and to guide policy and management. Here we tested a key assumption of a classic conceptual model that is widely used to estimate soil nitrous and nitric oxide emissions, using a laboratory experiment with two poorly drained agricultural soils. We found that there was not a clear trade-off in the emissions of nitric versus nitrous oxide as soil moisture varied from low to high levels, in contrast to predictions. Rather, emissions of nitrous oxide were greater than expected, and production of nitrous oxide and nitric oxide persisted under very wet conditions. Poorly drained patches of intensively fertilized agricultural soils could represent important sources of nitrous oxide to the atmosphere.",0,0,1.3.1.3.1,Biogenic Nitrogen Oxide Emissions: Fertilized Soils

In 2005, a report by the public/private partnership North American Research Strategy for Tropospheric Ozone (NARSTO) evaluated the strengths and weaknesses of North American emissions inventories and made recommendations for improving their effectiveness. This paper reviews the recommendation areas and briefly discusses what has been addressed, what remains unchanged, and new questions that have arisen. The findings reveal that all emissions inventory improvement areas identified by the 2005 NARSTO publication have been explored and implemented to some degree. The U.S. National Emissions Inventory has become more detailed and has incorporated new research into previously under-characterized sources such as fine particles and biomass burning. Additionally, it is now easier to access the emissions inventory and the documentation of the inventory via the internet. However, many emissions-related research needs exist, on topics such as emission estimation methods, speciation, scalable emission factor development, incorporation of new emission measurement techniques, estimation of uncertainty, top-down verification, and analysis of uncharacterized sources. A common theme throughout this retrospective summary is the need for increased coordination among stakeholders. Researchers and inventory developers must work together to ensure that planned emissions research and new findings can be used to update the emissions inventory. To continue to address emissions inventory challenges, industry, the scientific community, and government agencies need to continue to leverage resources and collaborate as often as possible. As evidenced by the progress noted, continued investment in and coordination of emissions inventory activities will provide dividends to air quality management programs across the country, continent, and world.

Large (~50?85%) reductions in anthropogenic emissions occurred in the northeastern U.S. and eastern Canada between 1995 and 2015. Spatially and temporally aggregated ambient concentrations of O3 precursors declined steadily along with emission reductions: multi-site mean annual nitrogen dioxide (NO2), carbon monoxide (CO), and toluene concentrations tracked state and regional emissions of oxides of nitrogen (NOx, NO + NO2), CO, and volatile organic compounds (VOC), respectively (r2?=?0.97, 0.88, and 0.73), showing linear responses of average O3 precursor concentrations to both state and regional emission reductions. O3 exhibited complex spatial and temporal variations, indicating that O3 was influenced not only by the steady decline of regional emissions but also by subregional emission changes, chemical and physical processes, and day-specific variations in emissions and weather. The statewide multi-site mean annual 4th-highest daily 8-h O3 peak declined at the rate of 0.86???0.14?ppbv?y?1 (1.1% y?1). Influences on peak daily 8-h O3 were studied using a long-term data record from a research site at Pinnacle State Park (PSP), located near Addison, New York. A generalized additive model (GAM) was applied to separate the influences of local and regional emission changes, weather, and other factors. GAM results indicate that the reduction of summer O3 peak values and the overall trends in O3 at PSP were due to changes in ambient pollutant levels, rather than to trends in temperature or other meteorological factors. Whereas PSP summer O3 was NOx-sensitive, O3 was often VOC-sensitive during winter and spring days. The frequency of VOC-sensitive days decreased between 2001 ? 2005 and 2012?2016, consistent with an expectation of increasing NOx sensitivity as ambient NOx concentrations decline.",0,0,1.7,Ambient Air Concentrations and Trends

Only the enhancements effectively respond to national emission controls. We investigate the temporal evolution and spatial variability in the largest ozone concentrations, i.e., those that define the ozone design value (ODV) upon which the National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS) is based, within the northern tier of US states. We focus on two regions: rural western states, with only small anthropogenic precursor emissions, and the urbanized northeastern states, which include the New York City urban area, the nation's most populated. The US background ODV (i.e., the ODV remaining if US anthropogenic precursor emissions were reduced to zero) is estimated to vary from 54 to 63 ppb in the rural western states and to be smaller and nearly constant (45.8 +/- 3.0 ppb) throughout the northeastern states. These US background ODVs correspond to 65 % to 90 % of the 2015 NAAQS of 70 ppb. Over the past 2 to 3 decades US emission control efforts have decreased the US anthropogenic ODV enhancements at an approximately exponential rate, with an e-folding time constant of similar to 22 years. These ODV enhancements are relatively large in the northeastern US, with state maximum ODV enhancements of similar to 35-64 ppb in 2000, but are not discernible in the rural western states. The US background ODV contribution is significantly larger than the present-day ODV enhancements due to photochemical production from US anthropogenic precursor emissions in the urban as well as the rural regions investigated. Forward projections of past trends suggest that average maximum ODVs in northeastern US will drop below the NAAQS of 70 ppb by about 2021, assuming that the exponential decrease in the ODV enhancements can be maintained and the US background ODV remains constant. This estimate is much more optimistic than in the Los Angeles urban area, where a similar approach estimates the maximum ODV to reach 70 ppb in similar to 2050 (Parrish et al., 2017a). The primary reason for this large difference is the significantly higher US ODV background (62.0 +/- 2.0 ppb) estimated for the Los Angeles urban area. The approach used in this work has some unquantified uncertainties that are discussed. Models can also estimate US background ODVs; some of those results are shown to correlate with the observationally based estimates derived here (r(2) values for different models are similar to 0.31 to 0.90), but they are on average systematically lower by 4 to 13 ppb. Further model improvement is required until their output can accurately reproduce the time series and spatial variability in observed ODVs.

Such levels are well above the U.S. air quality standard of 75 ppb. In these two remote basins in the Rockies, local ozone precursor emissions result from intense oil and gas extraction activities that release methane, volatile organic compounds (VOCs), and nitrogen oxides (NOx) to the atmosphere. These emissions become trapped beneath a stable and shallow (~50?200 m) boundary layer maintained in low wind conditions. Wintertime surface ozone formation conditions are more likely in the UBUT than in the UGRBWY as the topography of the UBUT is an enclosed basin whereas the UGRBWY is open on its southern perimeter thus allowing for more air turnover. With snow-covered ground, high ozone events regularly begin in mid-December and last into early March in the UBUT whereas they usually do not begin in earnest until about a month later in the UGRBWY and may persist until mid-March. Winters without snow cover and the accompanying cold pool meteorological conditions do not experience high ozone events in either basin. For nine years with ozone observations in the UGRBWY (2005?2013) and four in the UBUT (2010?2013), all years with adequate (?6 inches) and persistent snow cover, experienced days with ozone values ?75 ppb except in 2012 in the UGRBWY when persistent high wind (>5 m/s) conditions were prevalent.

Three-dimensional simulations over Los Angeles basin,"Lu, R; Turco, RP",1995,"The: air quality problems in the Los Angeles basin are related to the local climate. A strong temperature inversion and stagnant synoptic conditions associated with the Pacific high-pressure system favor the generation of severe air pollution episodes. Sea-breezes and mountain-induced flows play an important role: in controlling pollutant transport over the basin. The distributions of pollutants over the basin display complicated three-dimensional patterns, including distinct elevated layers. A three-dimensional meteorological model is used to simulate air flow patterns and pollutant transport in the Los Angeles basin under such conditions. The complex simulated flows are analyzed to explain the origin of the observed pollution layers. Pollutants found in the afternoon mixed layer may be dispersed to three different regions: the high desert to the east and north of the Los Angeles basin; the free troposphere above the temperature inversion; and within the temperature inversion layer itself. Several mechanisms transfer pollution into the inversion layer. Convergence zones in the San Fernando Valley and near Lake Elsinore lift polluted air into the inversion. A coupled sea-bree~eymountain-flow circulation along the southwest flank of the Santa Ana Mts creates pollution layers that extend westward over the coastal plain and offshore. The afternoon pollution layers frequently observed in the western Los Angeles basin are caused by the sea-breeze circulation or the coupled sea-breeze/mountain-flow circulation over the south slope of the San Gabriel Nlts. As the boundary layer stabilizes during the early evening, layers of polluted air are left suspended over the eastern basin. Pollutants trapped in the inversion layer act as a reservoir of poor-quality air for the basin, and may contribute to extreme pollutant concentrations seen after several days of stagnant air.",0,0,1.5.3,Interactions between Meteorology and Topography

The divergence of horizontal fluxes proves to be highly sensitive for point sources like exhaust stacks. Thus, NOx emissions from individual power plants can be resolved and quantified even on top of considerably high urban pollution from the Saudi Arabian capital city Riyadh.

The results collected show that the airborne tropospheric vertical column retrievals compare well with ground-based Pandora spectrometer column NO2 observations (r2=0.91 and slope of 1.03). Apparent disagreements between the two measurements can be sensitive to the coincidence criteria and are often associated with large local variability, including rapid temporal changes and spatial heterogeneity that may be observed differently by the sunward-viewing Pandora observations. The gapless mapping strategy executed during the 2017 GeoTASO flights provides data suitable for averaging to coarser areal resolutions to simulate satellite retrievals. As simulated satellite pixel area increases to values typical of TEMPO (Tropospheric Emissions: Monitoring Pollution), TROPOMI (TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument), and OMI (Ozone Monitoring Instrument), the agreement with Pandora measurements degraded, particularly for the most polluted columns as localized large pollution enhancements observed by Pandora and GeoTASO are spatially averaged with nearby less-polluted locations within the larger area representative of the satellite spatial resolutions (aircraft-to-Pandora slope: TEMPO scale?=0.88; TROPOMI scale?=0.77; OMI scale?=0.57).

Tropospheric NO2 columns observed by the satellite-based Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) over the US show a steady decrease until 2009 but a flattening afterward, which has been attributed to a flattening of NOx emissions, contradicting the NEI. We show here that the steady 2005?2017 decrease in NOx emissions reported by the NEI is in fact largely consistent with observed network trends of surface NO2 and ozone concentrations. The OMI NO2 trend is instead similar to that observed for nitrate wet deposition fluxes, which is weaker than that for anthropogenic NOx emissions, due to a large and increasing relative contribution of non-anthropogenic background sources of NOx (mainly lightning and soils). This is confirmed by contrasting OMI NO2 trends in urban winter, where the background is low and OMI NO2 shows a 2005?2017 decrease consistent with the NEI, and rural summer, where the background is high and OMI NO2 shows no significant 2005?2017 trend. A GEOS-Chem model simulation driven by NEI emission trends for the 2005?2017 period reproduces these different trends, except for the post-2009 flattening of OMI NO2, which we attribute to a model underestimate of free tropospheric NO2.

The Aerosol Research and Inhalation Epidemiological Study (ARIES) is an EPRI-sponsored project to collect air quality and meteorological data at a single site in north-western Atlanta, GA. Seventy high-resolution air quality indicators (AQIs) are used to examine statistical relation-ships between air quality and health outcome end points. Contemporaneous mortality data are collected for Fulton and DeKalb counties in Georgia. Currently, 12 months of air quality and weather data are available for analysis, from August 1998 through July 1999. The interim mortality analysis used Poisson regres-sion in generalized additive models (GAMs). The estimated log-linear association of mortality with various AQIs was adjusted for smoothed functions of time and meteoro-logical data. The analysis considered daily deaths due to all nonaccidental causes, deaths to persons 65 years or older, and deaths in each of the two constituent counties. The fine particle effect associated with the four mortality subgroups, using only today (lag 0), yesterday (lag 1), 2-day average (average of today and yesterday), and first difference (today minus yesterday) measurements of the air quality relative to today's number of deaths was positive for lag 0, lag 1, and 2-day average and positive only for decedents at least 65 years of age using first difference. The t values ranged from 0.81 to 1.15 for lag 0, 1.04 to 1.53 for lag 1, 1.10 to 1.66 for 2-day average, and -0.32 to 0.33 for first difference with 346 or 347 days of data. No statistically significant estimate of the linear coefficient was found for the other 14 air quality variables in our interim analysis for the four mortality subgroups. We discuss diagnostics to support these models. These interim analyses did not include an evaluation of sensitivity to a larger set of lag structures, nonlinear model specifications, multipollutant analyses, alternative weather model and smoothing model specifications, air pollution imputation schemes, or cause-specific mortality indicators, nor did they include a full reporting of model selection or goodness-of-fit indicators.

Lung, and Blood Institute; Research Resources Administration; Milstein Family Foundation; Dover Foundation; George and Abby O'Neill, Robert Winthrop, and Shirlee and Henry Benach Foundation. #Background. We studied 715 patients 2 weeks after myocardial infarction to establish the associations between six frequency domain measures of heart period variability (HPV) and mortality during 4 years of follow-up. Methods and Results. Each measure of HPV had a significant and at least moderately strong univariate association with all-cause mortality, cardiac death, and arrhythmic death. Power in the lower-frequency bands - ultra low frequency (ULF) and very low frequency (VLF) power -had stronger associations with all three mortality end points than power in the higher-frequency bands - low frequency (LF) and high frequency (HF) power. The 24-hour total power also had a significant and strong association with all three mortality end points. VLF power was the only variable that was more strongly associated with arrhythmic death than with cardiac death or all-cause mortality. In multivariate Cox regression models using a step-up approach to evaluate the independent associations between frequency domain measures of heart period variability and death of all causes, ULF power was selected first (i.e., was the single component with the strongest association). Adding VLF or LF power to the Cox regression   improved the prediction of outcome. With both ULF and VLF power in the Cox regression model, the addition of the other two components, LF and HF power, singly or together, did not significantly improve the prediction of all-cause mortality. We explored the relation between the heart period variability measures and all-cause mortality, cardiac death, and arrhythmic death before and after adjusting for five previously established post infarction risk predictors: age, New York Heart Association functional class, rales in the coronary care unit, left ventricular ejection fraction, and ventricular arrhythmias detected in a 24-hour Holter ECG recording. Conclusions. After adjustment for the five risk predictors, the association between mortality and total, ULF, and VLF power remained significant and strong, whereas LF and HF power were only moderately strongly associated with mortality. The tendency for VLF power to be more strongly associated with arrhythmic death than with all-cause or cardiac death was still evident after adjusting for the five covariates. Adding measures of HPV to previously known predictors of risk after myocardial infarction identifies small subgroups with a 2.5-year mortality risk of approximately 50%.",0,0,4.1.9,Heart Rate (HR) and Heart Rate Variability (HRV)

Potted specimens of 24 herbs, legumes and grasses were exposed during two seasons to four O3 treatments in open-top chambers. The ozone treatments were: (a) charcoal-filtered air; (b) charcoal-filtered air plus ozone to match ambient levels; (c) charcoal-filtered air plus O3 to ambient levels 1.5 and (d) charcoal-filtered air with ozone added to twice ambient levels during selected episodes of 7-13 d. During these ozone episodes, half of the plants in each ozone treatment received reduced irrigation (dry treatment) while the rest was kept under full irrigation (wet treatment). Type and date of first occurrence of leaf injury were noted during individual growth periods. Plants were harvested three times per year, and the percentage of injured leaves was recorded. Depending on species, injury symptoms were expressed as flecking (O3-specific injury), leaf yellowing or anthocyanin formation. Carom carvi and most species of the Fabaceae family (Onobrychis sativa, Trifolium repens, Trifolium pratense) were found to be most responsive to O3 injury occurring after only a few days of exposure in treatment (b). An episodic reduction in irrigation tended to reduce the expression of O3-specific symptoms, but only in species for which a reduction in soil moisture potential and an associated reduction in stomatal conductance during the dry episodes were observed. In other species, the protection from O3 injury seemed to be of little importance. Using artificial neural networks the injury response of nine species was analysed in relation to Species, stomatal conductance, ozone as AOT40 (accumulated exposure above a threshold of 0.04 ppm for periods with global radiation > 50 W m-2 (Fuhrer et al., 1997)), mean relative growth rate, air vapour pressure deficit and global radiation. In the model with all factors, Species was most important, and when Species was omitted, stomatal conductance was the most important determinant for leaf injury to occur, whereas mean relative growth rate was less important. With no plant-related factors included, air vapour pressure deficit and AOT4O were of highest importance. Only in eight species was a positive relationship found between these two factors during the five days before the onset of injury, indicating increasing protection from ozone with increasing air vapour pressure deficit in some hut not all species. These data show that across a range of grassland species, leaf injury caused hy elevated levels of ozone is most likely to occur in species with high stomatal conductance and that protection from ozone during dry periods is species-specific and depends on a reduction in stomatal conductance due to a decrease in soil moisture potential. Protection under increased vapour pressure deficit can occur in some but not all species, depending on the relationship between stomatal conductance and air vapour pressure deficit.",0,0,8.2,Visible Foliar Injury and Biomonitoring

Individuals of 24 grasses, herbs and legumes were grown in pots and exposed for two seasons to four levels of ozone in open-top chambers: (a) CF. charcoal-filtered air, (b) CFAA, charcoal-filtered air plus ozone to match ambient levels, (c) CF+, charcoal-filtered air plus ozone added to match 1.5 times ambient levels and (d) CF+ +, charcoal-filtered air with ozone added to match twice ambient levels during selected episodes of 7-13 d. During the ozone episodes, one half of the plants received reduced irrigation (dry treatment) while the rest was kept well watered (wet treatment). The effect of ozone on the relative growth rate was determined during the initial growth period during the first season. Above-ground plant dry weight was determined three times during each season, and stubble dry weight at the end of the experiment. In most species, the effect of ozone on relative growth rate was not significant, except in Centaurea jacea and Lychnis flos-cuculi for which a significant stimulation of relative growth rate was found. There was a significant negative relationship between percentage relative growth rate and relative growth rate measured in the CF treatment, indicating that in species growing faster in clean air relative growth rate tended to be more sensitive to ozone than in slower-growing species. After the first re-growth period during the first season, a significant effect of ozone on above-ground biomass was found in five species, i.e. a decrease in Chrysanthemum leucanthemum, Trifolium pratense and T. repens, and an increase in Silene dioiia. During the second season no significant ozone effect was detected, except for an increase in stubble mass in C. leucanthemum. In 10 species, the dry treatment caused a significant decrease in biomass, but in Plantago lanceolata during the first year, and in Knautia arvensis and T. repens during the second year, an ozone x irrigation interaction was observed. Exposure-response patterns in the wet treatment varied between species. In some species growth tended to be increased in charcoal-filtered air plus ozone to ambient levels, in others either a continuous increase or decrease in biomass was observed with increasing ozone. Trifolium repens showed the lowest AOT40 (ozone accumulated above a threshold of 40 ppb) corresponding to a 10% change in biomass. The comparison between exposure-response pattern between the wet and dry treatments revealed reduced, increased, or unchanged ozone sensitivity. The shift was related to plant strategy and not to the specific sensitivity to the dry treatment. The specific response to both ozone and dry treatment tended to be related to Grime's triangular classification of plant strategies, i.e. the C-S-R model. In species with a large component of C (competitor strategy), and/or R (ruderal strategy), biomass was more sensitive to both stresses, compared with species with a high component of S (stress tolerators), and ozone x drought interactions were more pronounced. The results indicate that specific relative growth rate is an important determinant for the potential sensitivity of grassland species to long-term effects of ozone, and that reduced irrigation causes no general protection from the effects of ozone on growth.",0,0,8.2,Visible Foliar Injury and Biomonitoring

To test several hypotheses related to these issues, we examined the physiological, morphological and growth responses of six perennial species grown at various atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide and ozone. The species involved (two C3 trees: Populus tremuloides Michx., Quercus rubra L.; two C3 grasses: Agropyron smithii Rybd., Koeleria cristata L.; two C4 grasses: Bouteloua turtipendula Michx., Schizachyrium scoparium Michx.) differed in growth form, stomatal conductance and photosynthetic pathway. In situ photosynthesis, relative growth rate (RGR) and its determinants (leaf area ratio, specific leaf area, leaf weight ratio and root weight ratio) were determined via sequential harvests of seedlings that were grown in all combinations of 366 or 672 Amol mol-1 CO2 and 3 or 95 nmol mol-1 O3 over a 101-d period. Elevated CO2 had minimal effect on either photosynthesis or RGR. By contrast, RGR for all six species was lower in high O3 concentrations at ambient CO2, significantly so in A. smithii and P. tremuloides. Five of the six species also exhibited reductions in in situ photosynthesis at ambient CO2 in high-O3-grown compared with low-O3-grown plants. For all species, these O3 reductions in RGR and photosynthesis were absent in the elevated CO2 environment. Root weight ratio was significantly reduced by elevated O3 in A. smithii and P. tremuloides in ambient but not elevated CO2. Species with high stomatal conductance were the most susceptible to oxidant injury, while those with low stomatal conductance, such as the C4 species and Q. rubra, were not as detrimentally affected by O3. Elevated levels of CO2 will reduce stomatal conductance and O3 uptake, and might therefore reduce the potential for oxidant damage. However, there was a stronger relationship of the percent reduction in whole-plant mass due to O3, related to the ratio of photosynthesis to stomatal conductance, In general, results of this study of six functionally diverse plant species suggest that O3 pollution effects on carbon balance and growth are likely to be ameliorated by elevated concentrations of atmospheric CO2.",0,0,8.2,Visible Foliar Injury and Biomonitoring

Growing season 12-h daily average O3 levels are 0.06-0.09 ppm, and N deposition rates are 5-45 kg N/ha per year. However, N deposition rates have high spatial variability due to the heterogeneous and open-patchy characteristics of these stands. Annual deposition fluxes are greatest to canopy-covered areas with high pollution exposure. The harmful effects of O3 on sensitive pines are well documented, and selected areas in the San Bernardino and San Gabriel mountains have reached N-saturation as demonstrated by high nitrate (NO3-) export in streams, and a suite of plant and edaphic indicators. The adverse effects of O3 culminate at the community level as a result of chronic effects on pine needle structure, retention, and physiology. Alterations in whole-tree biomass occur after several years due to higher carbon retention in the shoot for O3 detoxification, and lower carbon allocation to roots, as a result of O3 and N deposition. As a consequence, tree susceptibility to drought, windthrow, and root diseases could be exacerbated. Changes in forest community structure may occur due to the death of O3-sensitive pines and fire suppression, and pine replacement by faster-growing, O3-tolerant cedar and fir species. The negative impact of atmospheric N deposition occurs at the ecosystem-level as an alteration of biogeochemical nutrient cycling. For trees growing on N-deficient soils, increased supplies of N could moderate harmful O3 effects on growth for several decades. Over time, levels of soil N rise due to sustained inputs from the atmosphere, and the accelerated production and senescence of N-rich foliage by O3. The increase in soil N is expected to favor the proliferation of nitrophilous overstory and understory species relative to pines. At this stage, N-limitation of forest productivity would be partially alleviated, and N emissions from soil and NO3- leaching losses elevated as a result of high soil N availability. In the western San Bernardino Mountains and in low-elevation chaparral watersheds in the San Gabriel Mountains, NO3- levels in streams are as high or higher than in any other undisturbed montane watersheds in North America, and NO3- contamination of domestic water supplies is of near-term concern.

A wide range in sensitivity of photosynthesis both within and between species is evident from the literature for the pollutants sulphur dioxide, ozone, nitrogen oxide and hydrogen fluoride. Some of this variation is clearly due to genetic factors, but much is in response to differences in environmental conditions both prior to and during fumigation. Exposure of plants to mixtures of pollutants generally reduced the threshold at which effects were first detected and increased the level of inhibitory responses. In the majority of studies on stomatal responses to air pollutants, opening occurs at low concentrations, below the threshold for effects on photosynthesis, and closure occurs at injurious concentrations; this latter response often following the inhibition of photosynthesis. Effects on carbon allocation have been reported in response to air pollutants. Changes usually favour leaf development over root growth, which can compensate for a decline in net assimilation rate up to a certain point but may limit water uptake from soils with low moisture content.

The species represented a wide range of different plant strategies according to the C-S-R model. The results show that the stress-tolerators, S, had a smaller mean relative growth rate, R, during the exposure period and also a smaller accumulation of biomass compared with other strategies. The species with the intermediate strategy, CSR, had a R similar to that of the species with a large component of C, the competitor strategy, and/or R, the ruderal strategy, whereas the net accumulation of biomass was smaller in the CSR group. This difference between R and net growth for the CSR species compared to the species of other strategies, can be explained by a slower growth for the CSR group during the establishment phase. In the present investigation the response to ozone was very small regardless of plant strategy, although there was a weak trend towards slower growth with higher ozone concentration, 18 out of 27 species having a greater growth in CF than in NF+. The growth of one typical stress-tolerant species, Festuca ovina L., was stimulated significantly by ozone. Visible injury, most likely caused by ozone, was noticed in three species, Dactylis glomerata L., Dactylis aschersoniana Graebn. and Phleum alpinum L. Although there were no major restrictions to plant growth in terms of water, nutrients or space in the present open-top chamber experiment, the variability in all climatic factors was as large as in the ambient air.

Scop., Festuca ovina L., Pilosella officinarum E Shultz & Shultz-Bip and Lotus corniculatus L. In a chronic fumigation (mean 03 concentration of 71 ppb (71 nil-1) for 7 h d', AOT4O 4585 ppb-h) which lasted for 21 d, the effects of ozone were assessed using classical growth analysis. Large reductions in mean relative growth rates for shoot and root weight and root length were observed for the two legumes (Fabaceae) Lotus corniculatus and Anthyllis vulneraria, although these were only statistically significant for Lotus corniculatus. Significant reductions in specific root length (length per unit dry weight) were found for Cirsium acaule and Pilosella officina rum (Asteraceae), while for Festuca ovina (Poaceae) the allometric coefficient was reduced significantly following exposure to ozone. An acute fumigation (mean 03 concentration of 196 ppb, 7 h) resulted in a range of visible injury, from no injury (Festuca ovina and Pilosella officinarum) through moderate levels of injury (Cirsium acaule and Lotus corniculatus) to extensive and widespread injury (Anthyllis vulneraria). Scoring of visible damage showed that this was only statistically significant for the two legumes, Lotus corniculatus and Anthyllis vulneraria. These results suggest that native herbs may differ in their sensitivity to tropospheric ozone. Both chronic and acute exposures revealed that members of the Fabaceae may be most sensitive to ozone pollution, but the study also suggests that subtle changes in root morphology occurred for members of the Asteraceae. These findings are discussed in relation to the critical levels of ozone set recently for plants and the implications of increasing tropospheric ozone for the conservation of native plant communities.

Visible foliar injury occurred within a few days of the initiation of treatments and developed continuously in x 1.7 and x 3.0 treatments. Leaf senescence began earlier in trees exposed to greater-than-ambient treatments. Gas-exchange variables were measured five times over the growing season. Net photosynthesis was progressively decreased and finally reduced by 40 and 70% on tolerant and sensitive clones, respectively, but stomatal conductance was not affected by the O(3) treatments. As stomatal conductance (g(s)) values did not differ in the two types of aspen, we conclude that this is not the defense mechanism to O(3) in aspen. At the end of the season, dry weight was reduced by up to 55 and 35% in sensitive and tolerant clones, respectively. Ozone effects were significant and linear on foliar injury, biomass and growth variables such as height, diameter of stem and total leaf area.

This paper presents data relating to genetic variation, ozone concentrations, stomatal conductance and light (PAR) within populations. The data show that populations differ in genetic diversity, one consisting of only three genets while another was very diverse. In the former population, symptoms varied greatly within a single genet, pointing to a large micro-environmental influence. Measurements of ozone, stomatal conductance and PAR within plant canopies suggest that variation in symptom expression is unlikely to be due to differences in ozone flux and more likely to be due to variation in light.

The ozone-induced decrease in root system respiration of potted plants was more closely correlated with decreased root dry weight than with specific root respiration, suggesting that aspen root metabolism was less affected by ozone than root growth. We used minirhizotrons to study the appearance and disappearance of roots in the field. Length of live roots of field-grown trees increased rapidly early in the season and peaked by midseason in association with a decrease in root production and an increase in root disappearance. In the twice-ambient ozone treatment, live root lengths were 17% less than those of controls, but the effect was not statistically significant.

Mature tree fine-root respiration was measured in summer 1994 in order to calculate gross fine-root production and belowground carbon use efficiency (BUE). After two seasons of exposure, 2 x ozone (0.082 ppm 7 h-mean conc.) reduced mature tree cumulative net fine-root production and turnover by 33% and 42%, respectively, relative to ambient ozone (0.042 ppm 7 h-mean conc.).

During summer 1994, mature tree BUE was reduced by 2 x ozone; we hypothesized that this response was due to increased root respiration for active nutrient uptake in order to meet increased foliar demand for nutrients. Decreased fine-root production, turnover, and BUE under 2 x ozone for the mature trees indicates that ozone can alter the dynamics of belowground carbon allocation in mature red oak.

Plants were grown from seed, potted into natural soils and exposed in open-top chambers for the entire season to different ozone-exposure regimes covering a range of concentrations from <5 to 48 ppb (seasonal 8 h daily mean). The assessment of ozone effects was carried out by recording the first day of visible symptom appearance and the percentage of injured leaves at the end of vegetative growth. Species exhibited contrasting patterns of symptom expression under ozone stress, with either ozone-specific symptoms or ozone-enhanced foliar pigmentation and senescence. Classifications of species according to their ozone susceptibility varied depending on whether measurement was of the total extent of visible injury, ozone threshold doses for the incidence of symptoms, or modelled exposure-response relationships. The most sensitive species exhibiting ozone-specific symptoms were Cirsium arvense and Sonchus asper, which responded to accumulated ozone exposures <1500 ppb.h (AOT4O). For these and three other species, an A0T40 peak of a single day was found to be responsible for the incidence of ozone-specific symptoms, i.e. injury occurred rapidly within a few days of the day with the highest AOT4O, while other species responded only to longer-term ozone exposures. The relative ozone sensitivity of the species was calculated by combining the different sensitivity criteria, and possible systematic trends (taxonomic or evolutionary features) are pointed out. The results suggest it may be possible to use a particular group of native herbaceous plant species with contrasting patterns of ozone sensitivity as a biomonitoring system in the field.

More specifically this is done by exploring the limits of what can be shown by LCA and other tools. This is done from several perspectives. First, experiences from current LCAs and methodology discussions are used including a discussion on the type of impacts typically included, quality of inventory data, methodological choices in relation to time aspects, allocation, characterisation and weighting methods and uncertainties in describing the real world. Second, conclusions from the theory of science are practised. It is concluded that it can in general not be shown that one product is environmentally preferable to another one, even if this happens to be the case. This conclusion has important policy implications. If policy changes require that it must be shown that one product is more (or less) environmentally preferable before any action can be taken, then it is likely that no action is ever going to take place. If we want changes to be made, decisions must be taken on a less rigid basis. It is expected that in this decision making process, LCA can be a useful input. Since it is the only tool that can be used for product comparisons over the whole life cycle, it can not be replaced by any other tool and should be used.

Approximately, 55% of the considered plots received an N input above 1000 molc ha-1 yr-1 (14 kg ha-1 yr-1), being a deposition level above which the species diversity of the ground vegetation may decrease. The total input of acidity ranged mostly between 200 and 4000 molc ha-1 yr-1. The deposition of SO4, NO3 and Ca was significantly higher in the central/eastern part of Europe, but NH4 was slightly higher in western Europe.

Above a base saturation of 25% and a pH level of 4.5, there was a strong relationship between Ca and strong acid anions, indicating that the acidity is mainly neutralised by the release of base cations in less acidified soils.

Following a 7-day adjustment period, each of six OTCs (duplicate OTCs per treatment) was ventilated with either air that had been carbon-filtered (CF) to remove ambient ozone (O3); non-filtered (NF), representative of ambient air; or enriched to twice-ambient O3 concentration (2X). Primary-growth forage was harvested on days 7, 32, 46, 59 and 72 following the start of fumigation, and regrowth forage from the first primary-growth harvest was harvested on days 36, 54 and 72 following the start of fumigation. Dry matter (DM) yield of either forage species did not differ among treatments except in the final regrowth period when yield of sericea lespedeza was greater for the NF than 2X O3 treatment. In vitro DM digestibility (IVDMD) and concentrations of crude protein (CP), soluble phenolics (SP) and condensed tannins (CT) in primary-growth sericea lespedeza did not differ between treatments, but NF primary-growth forage had higher concentration of protein-precipitating tannins (PPT) than did 2X primary-growth forage. Concentrations of neutral detergent fiber (NDF), acid detergent fiber (ADF) and acid detergent lignin (ADL) were higher in NF and 2X than in CF primary-growth sericea lespedeza. Similarly, concentrations of NDF and ADL were higher, and IVDMD was lower for NF and 2X than for CF regrowth sericea lespedeza. Concentrations of ADF and ADL were lower, whereas IVDMD, in vitro NDF digestibility (IVNDFD) and concentrations of CP and SP were greater, in CF than in NF and 2X primary-growth little bluestem. Percentages IVDMD and IVNDFD and concentrations of CP and SP in NF primary-growth little bluestem were greater than those in forage exposed to 2X O3 treatment. No significant differences were observed among treatments in percentages IVDMD and IVNDFD, or concentrations of cell wall constituents or SP in little bluestem regrowth. Nutritive quality of little bluestem was decreased by <2%, and that of sericea lespedeza by ~7% as a result of increased concentrations of cell wall constituents and decreased in vitro digestibility of NF and 2X compared with CF forages. Results indicate that existing and projected O3 levels can drive alterations in forage quality of select warm-season forages sufficient to have nutritional and economic implications for their utilization by ruminant herbivores.",0,0,8.3.1,Declines in Growth Rates

Although the effects of acid rain were generally not significant, there was a trend toward increased aboveground biomass and leaf area in seedlings subjected to the low pH treatments. Because N concentrations in the soils generally increased with decreasing pH, we concluded that the effects of acid rain on aboveground biomass and leaf area were a consequence of an increasing concentration of soil N. In the 1989 harvest, seedlings in the 2.5 x ambient ozone treatment had significantly less biomass in all aboveground plant components and significantly less total leaf area than seedlings in the 1.7 x ambient ozone treatment. In the 1990 harvest, there were no significant effects of ozone on total aboveground biomass, although there was a trend toward reduced biomass in seedlings in the 2.5 x ambient ozone treatment.

The ZAPS provided daily O3 enrichment of the air during a 14-h daytime period starting at 07:00 Pacific daylight savings time, resulting in 12 unique exposure treatments, with additional control plots exposed to ambient air. Enrichment was provided for 92 days in 1988 and 101 days in 1989. The minimum and maximum 12-h (09:00-20:59 Pacific daylight savings time) seasonal mean O3 concentrations obtained were 18 and 41 ppb (nL/L) in 1988 and 27 and 66 ppb in 1989. Destructive harvests and nondestructive measurements were taken at intervals throughout the 1988 and 1989 exposure periods, and once in 1990. Variability within the tree population and the relatively low levels of exposure resulted in no significant effects on growth being observed until the latter part of the second year of treatment. In the later harvests in 1989, analysis by simple linear regression showed significant reductions in the dry weight of second-flush growth as a result of O3 treatment. The effect carried over into the third year, as revealed by small but significant reductions in leader length. In both cases, the use of nonlinear Weibull and gamma-type regression models resulted in improved fits to the data.

Empirically derived annual growth velocities, peak velocity (V-pk), and age at which peak velocity occurred (Age(pk)) were determined for height, FVC, FEV(1), and FEF(25-75), for each child. Mean velocity curves for height, FVC, FEV(1), and FEF(25-75) stratified by sex and Age(pk) of height (an indicator for early, middle, or late maturity) were produced as a function of age. The differences between Age(pk) of FVC, FEV(1), and FEF(25-75) and Age(pk) of height (i.e., the lag period) were compared by sex and by the indicator of maturity. Linear regression analyses were performed to investigate associations between V-pk and Age(pk) of height, as well as between the lag period and Age(pk) of height. As is generally observed in height growth, there were considerable variations in the age of onset and magnitudes of the adolescent growth spurts of the pulmonary function parameters both between sexes and among children of the same sex. The duration of adolescent growth spurt appeared to be similar for all children, regardless of early, middle, or late maturity. Thus, those who matured earlier had shorter total growth periods than those who matured later. On the other hand, early maturers had greater growth velocities during preadolescence and greater adolescent V-pk than later maturers. The pulmonary function growth spurt generally lagged behind the height growth spurt. The length of this lag period was on average 0.6 to 0.9 yr, but it varied with a child's age at peak height velocity.

For this reason, PM(2.5) was partitioned into its three major constituents: SO(2-)(4), carbon (EC + 1.4 OC), and the remainder; sulfate was assumed to be (NH(4))(2)SO(4) for this purpose. Initial AQI screening was based on all-cause (ICD-9 codes <800) mortality for those aged 65 and over. For the (apparently) most important pollutants--PM(2.5) and its 3 major constituents, coarse PM mass [CM], 1-h maximum CO, 8-h maximum O(3)--we investigated 15 mortality categories in detail. (The 15 categories result from three age groups [all ages, <65, 65+] and five cause-of-death groups [all disease causes, cardiovascular, respiratory, cancer, and other ""remainder"" disease causes]). The GLM model outputs that were considered included mean AQI effects and their standard errors, and two indicators of relative model performance (deviance and deviance adjusted for the number of observations and model parameters). The latter indicator was considered to account for variations in the number of observations created by varying amounts of missing AQI data, which were not imputed. The single-AQI screening regressions on all-cause 65+ mortality show that CO, NO(2), PM(2.5), CM, SO(2), and O(3), followed by EC and OC, consistently have the best model fits, after adjusting for the number of observations. Their relative rankings, however, vary according to the smoothing knots used, and there is no correspondence between mean AQI effect and overall model fit.(Other regression runs often show that the best model fits are obtained with no AQI in the model.) There is no correspondence between mean AQI effect and statistical significance or between mean effect and serial correlation. There is a highly significant (.001 level) relationship between overall model fit and serial correlation; the best fitting models have the most frequent knot spacing and the most negative serial correlation. The regression analyses by cause of death find elderly circulatory deaths to be consistently associated with CO for all models.",0,0,3.1.9,Respiratory Mortality

A screening study was carried out in open-top chambers (OTCs) to assess the O3-sensitivity of representative therophytes of these ecosystems based on the response of selected growth-related parameters. Three O3 treatments and 3 OTCs per treatment were used. Legume species were very sensitive to O3, because 78% of the tested species showed detrimental effects on their total biomass relative growth rate (RGR) following their exposure to O3. The Trifolium genus was particularly sensitive showing O3-induced adverse effects on most of the assessed parameters. Gramineae plants were less sensitive than Leguminosae species because detrimental effects on total biomass RGR were only observed in 14% of the assessed species. No relationship was found between relative growth rates when growing in clean air and O3 susceptibility.

Study Design: The studies described in this report were conducted by two investigator groups: Dr. John Balmes and colleagues of the University of California, San Francisco, and Dr. Mark Frampton and associates of the University of Rochester. Drs. Balmes and Frampton used similar ozone exposure regimens but different study populations: normal and asthmatic men and women exposed to 0.2 ppm ozone or clean air for four hours in the Balmes study, and male and female nonsmokers and smokers exposed to 0.22 ppm ozone or clean air for four hours in the Frampton study. In both studies subjects performed moderate exercise during the exposures. The investigators made a number of pulmonary function measurements and used a procedure called bronchoscopy to collect fluids and tissue samples from the subjects' airways. They analyzed these samples for indicators of inflammation and lung damage. Results and Implications: The results of the studies reported here suggest that measuring symptoms and pulmonary function (using standard measurements of air flow) may not be sufficient to evaluate the potential risks associated with ozone exposure. Many individuals experience airway inflammation after being exposed to ozone, and this response is not reflected in the FEV1 response. The significance of ozone-induced inflammation in terms of subsequent airway disease has not been determined. More attention needs to be directed toward assessing the effects of ozone on small airway function and toward developing noninvasive measurements of airway inflammation.",0,0,3.1.4.4.1,Controlled Human Exposure Studies

Ozone-injury indices were constructed by adding percent chlorotic mottle and percent necrosis for each needle age-class. Percent necrosis was weighted from 1 to 5 times to construct different indices. Seedlings grown in nonfiltered air plus 1,5 times ambient ozone developed severe foliar injury after 2 years of exposure and were the only seedlings with significant reductions in radial growth after three seasons of exposure to a mean seasonal ozone concentration of 88 ppb. Foliage that had developed &gt; 30% chlorotic mottle by September of the 2nd year had abscised by September of the following year. Reduction in radial growth was significantly correlated with amount of foliar injury in well-watered trees, and the best-fit regression equation occurred when percent necrosis was weighted by a factor of 4. Regressions between foliar-injury indices and radial growth in drought-stressed trees were not significant, nor were regressions between radial growth and foliar injury among well-watered trees with only 1 year of premature needle abscission. The low R(2) (0.30) between foliar injury and radial growth in well-watered trees and the lack of a significant regression in drought-stressed trees suggest that detection of reductions in stem diameter growth of ponderosa pine in the field in response to ozone injury could be difficult, except for severely injured trees with fewer than 2 years of foliar retention.",0,0,8.2,Visible Foliar Injury and Biomonitoring

Extensive research demonstrates that local plant species diversity generally declines in response to nutrient enrichment, yet the mechanisms for this decline remain unclear. Based on an analysis of >900 species responses from 34 N-fertilization experiments across nine terrestrial ecosystems in North America, we show that both trait-neutral and trait-based mechanisms operate simultaneously to influence diversity loss as production increases. Rare species were often lost because of soil fertilization, randomly with respect to traits. The risk of species loss due to fertilization ranged from >60% for the rarest species to 10% for the most abundant species. Perennials, species with N-fixing symbionts, and those of native origin also experienced increased risk of local extinction after fertilization, regardless of their initial abundance.

OBJECTIVES: We tested the hypothesis that the ultrafine fraction of ambient pollutant particles would cause endothelial cell dysfunction. METHODS: We profiled gene expression of human pulmonary artery endothelial cells (HPAEC) exposed to ultrafine particles (UFPs; 100 ?g/mL) from Chapel Hill, North Carolina, or vehicle for 4 hr with Affymetrix HG U133 Plus 2.0 chips (n = 4 each). RESULTS: We found 320 up-regulated genes and 106 down-regulated genes (p < 0.01, 5% false discovery rate). We noted up-regulation of genes related to coagulation [tissue factor (F3) and coagulation factor II receptor-like 2 (F2RL2)] and differential regulation of genes related to F3 signaling (FOS, JUN, and NFKBIA). Results of quantitative polymerase chain reaction show a significant up-regulation of F3 after 10 and 100 ?g/mL UFP exposures. Additionally, the water-soluble fractions of UFPs were sufficient to induce the expression of F3, F2RL2, and heme oxygenase 1 (HMOX1). Treatment of HPAEC with UFPs for 16 hr increased the release of interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-8. Pretreatment of HPAEC with a blocking antibody against F3 attenuated IL-6 and IL-8 release by 30 and 70%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Using gene profiling, we discovered that UFPs may induce vascular endothelial cells to express genes related to clotting.

Current evidence has implicated the role of inflammation in atherogenesis and plaque destabilization. Thus, inflammatory cytokines may attenuate interstitial collagen synthesis, increase matrix degradation, and promote apoptosis in several atheroma-associated cell types, and all these cellular events may enhance plaque vulnerability. Several cell types found within the lesion (ie, monocyte/macrophages, T cells, mast cells, platelets) contribute to this immune-mediated plaque destabilization, and a better understanding of these processes is a prerequisite for the development of new treatment strategies in these individuals. Such knowledge could also facilitate a better identification of high-risk individuals.

The main purpose of the programme is to assess the potential risks for the forest vegetation and the natural ecosystems at the intensive monitoring plots. During the first years of the programme the surveys were qualitative, reporting only the number and the name of the symptomatic species in selected Light Exposed Sampling Site. In 2003 a new plot design was tested, based on the distribution of a number of miniplots along the edge of the forest, so as to obtain quantitative findings about the occurrence and distribution of the symptoms. The problems that still persist are related to: (i) the forest edge assessed for ozone symptoms may have a different floristic composition from the Level II plot itself; (ii) the anthropic pressure and the disturbances affecting the forest edge alters the floristic composition; (iii) the variability of the plant composition in the forest edge, which makes comparability difficult between different sites; and (iv) the evaluation of symptoms in several species that have not yet been experimentally tested. Further difficulties are due to the fact that symptoms observed in the field are often aspecific and cannot, therefore, be attributed solely to the phytotoxic action of ozone.

Ozone treatments covered a range of concentrations from 20 to 55 ppb ozone (seasonal 8 h daily mean).

Ozone caused a significant reduction in leaf biomass of more than 20% in six species, and a significant increase in leaf biomass in three species. The relative ozone sensitivities of the species in terms of leaf biomass were different from those inferred from total shoot biomass or seed production, indicating that ozone alters resource allocation patterns in wild plants but there was considerable variation between species in effects on the allocation to leaves, stems, flowers/fruits and seeds. Germinability of seeds was affected by ozone such that germination rate was up to 30% lower in ozone-treated plants compared to control plants.

Recent studies have provided estimates of this climate effect through correlations of air quality with meteorological variables, perturbation analyses in chemical transport models (CTMs), and CTM simulations driven by general circulation model (GCM) simulations of 21st-century climate change. We review these different approaches and their results. The future climate is expected to be more stagnant, due to a weaker global circulation and a decreasing frequency of mid-latitude cyclones. The observed correlation between surface ozone and temperature in polluted regions points to a detrimental effect of warming. Coupled GCM?CTM studies find that climate change alone will increase summertime surface ozone in polluted regions by 1?10 ppb over the coming decades, with the largest effects in urban areas and during pollution episodes. This climate penalty means that stronger emission controls will be needed to meet a given air quality standard. Higher water vapor in the future climate is expected to decrease the ozone background, so that pollution and background ozone have opposite sensitivities to climate change. The effect of climate change on particulate matter (PM) is more complicated and uncertain than for ozone. Precipitation frequency and mixing depth are important driving factors but projections for these variables are often unreliable. GCM?CTM studies find that climate change will affect PM concentrations in polluted environments by ?0.1?1 ?g m?3 over the coming decades. Wildfires fueled by climate change could become an increasingly important PM source. Major issues that should be addressed in future research include the ability of GCMs to simulate regional air pollution meteorology and its sensitivity to climate change, the response of natural emissions to climate change, and the atmospheric chemistry of isoprene.

Methods: The sample data were collected between 2001 and 2003 and are categorised by gender and age. Generalised linear Poisson regression models were adopted to control for both short- and long-term seasonal changes as well as for temperature and relative humidity. The non-linear dependencies were controlled using a natural cubic spline function.

In Toronto, 31 subjects were exposed to 4 different conditions (particles plus ozone, particles, ozone, and filtered air). In Toronto, diastolic blood pressure significantly increased (2.9 and 3.6 mm Hg) only during particle-containing exposures in association with particulate matter concentration and reductions in heart rate variability. Flow-mediated dilatation significantly decreased (2.0% and 2.9%) only 24 hours after particle-containing exposures in association with particulate matter concentration and increases in blood tumor necrosis factor alpha.

Flow-mediated dilatation remained unaltered. Particulate matter, not ozone, was responsible for increasing diastolic blood pressure during air pollution inhalation, most plausibly by instigating acute autonomic imbalance. Only particles from urban Toronto additionally impaired endothelial function, likely via slower proinflammatory pathways.

Thirty-three species from Snowdonia, North Wales, UK, were exposed for 10 weeks to a weekly episodic ozone regime in solardomes representing predicted future concentrations. Two solardomes were used as controls, with ozone added to charcoal-filtered air to give a continuous ozone concentration of 30 ppb (03(30)).

Foliar concentrations of cell-wall constituents were not affected by EDU alone; however, EDU x O-3 interactions were observed for total cell-wall constituents and lignocellulose fraction. Our results demonstrated that O-3 altered the physiology and productivity of cutleaf coneflower, and although reducing visible injury EDU may be phytotoxic at higher concentrations.

of the Lithuanian Institute of Horticulture. The aim of the experiment was to ascertain the  
adaptivity of fat-hen (Chenopodium album L.) at different ozone concentrations and doses of UV-B  
radiation at temperature regimes of warmer 25 degrees C/16 degrees C and actual 21 degrees C/14  
degrees C climate. The experimental evidence suggests that the 2-4 kJ m(-2) d(-1) UV-B dose  
exerted a negative effect on green and air-dry mass accumulation in fiat-hen canopy and roots.  
The 4 kJ m(-2) d(-1) UV-B dose resulted in a decrease in fat-hen canopy green mass by 82.2% (more  
than 5 times) compared with the control plants. The evaluation of canopy height showed similar  
results. In the forecasted warmer 25 degrees C/16 degrees C climate conditions the 2 kJ m(-2) d 
(-1) UV-B dose influenced fat-hen air-dry mass reduction by 47% and in the 4 kJ m(-2) d(-1) UV-B  
dose conditions the accumulation of air-dry mass decreased by nearly 3.5 times and the height  
decreased by 43% compared with the control pots. The test of ozone concentration showed opposite  
results. In the actual climate conditions, an increase of the ozone concentration to 40 and 80 mu  
g m(-3) increased the accumulation of fat-hen canopy green mass by 27 and 25.4%, accordingly. At  
higher temperature (25 degrees C/16 degrees C), the rising ozone concentration to 40 and 80 pg  
m-3 increased the accumulation of fat-hen air-dry mass by 27 and 33%, accordingly. The  
significant differences showed that fat-hen was very sensitive to UV-B radiation both at lower

The results of these studies are inconsistent, but warrant further attention. The objective of the study was to assess the effect of relation between exposure to urban air pollution and the prevalence allergic rhinitis among school children. Methods: We conducted a nationwide cross-sectional study of 32,143 Taiwanese school children. We obtained routine air-pollution monitoring data for sulphur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen oxides (NOx), ozone (O3), carbon monoxide (CO), and particles with an aerodynamic diameter of 10 mum or less (PM10). A parent-administered questionnaire provided information on individual characteristics and indoor environments (response rate 92%). Municipal-level exposure was calculated using the mean of the 2000 monthly averages. The effect estimates were presented as odds ratios (ORs) per 10 ppb change for SO2, NOx, and O3, 100 ppb change for CO, and 10 mug/ m<sup>3</sup> change for PM10. Results: In two-stage hierarchical model adjusting for confounding, the prevalence of allergic rhinitis was significantly associated with SO2 (adjusted odds ratio (OR) = 1.43, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.25, 1.64), CO (aOR = 1.05, 95% CI: 1.04, 1.07), and NOx (aOR = 1.11, 95% CI: 1.08, 1.15). Contrary to our hypothesis, the prevalence of allergic rhinitis was weakly or not related to O3 (aOR = 1.05, 95% CI: 0.98, 1.12) and PM10 (aOR = 1.00, 95% CI: 0.99, 1.02).

Emerging evidence suggests that people with metabolic syndrome (MS) may be a more susceptible population. OBJECTIVES: Our goal was to examine potential inflammatory responses associated with long-term PM exposure and MS-dependent susceptibility. METHODS: We conducted secondary analyses of white blood cell (WBC) count and MS data from The Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey and PM10 (PM with aerodynamic diameter < 10 ?ZA?m) data from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Aerometric Information Retrieval System. Estimated 1-year PM10 exposures were aggregated at the centroid of each residential census-block group, using distance-weighted averages from all monitors in the residing and adjoining counties. We restricted our analyses to adults (20-89 years of age) with normal WBC (4,000-11,000 ??a?? 10<sup>6</sup>/L), no existing cardiovascular disease, complete PM10 and MS data, and living in current residences > 1 year (n = 2,978; age 48.5 ??A? 17.8 years). Mixed-effects models were constructed to account for autocorrelation and potential confounders. RESULTS: After adjustment for demographics, socioeconomic factors, lifestyles, residential characteristics, and MS, we observed a statistically significant association between WBC count and estimated local PM10 levels (p = 0.035). Participants from the least polluted areas (1-year PM10 < 1st quartile cutoff 27.8 ?ZA?g/m??A?) had lower WBC counts than the others (difference = 145 ??a?? 10<sup>6</sup>/L; 95% confidence interval, 10-281).

We evaluated the impact of ambient air pollution on outpatient physician visits for otitis media in a population-based birth cohort. METHODS: All children born in southwestern British Columbia during 1999-2000 were followed until the age of 2 years. Residential air pollution exposures were estimated for the first 24 months of life by inverse-distance weighting of monitor data (CO, NO, NO2, O3, PM2.5, PM10, SO2), temporally adjusted land-use regression models (NO, NO2, PM2.5, black carbon, woodsmoke), and proximity to roads and point sources. We used generalized estimating equations to longitudinally assess the relationship between physician visits for otitis media (ICD-9) and average pollutant exposure in the 2 months prior to the visit, after adjustment for covariates. RESULTS: Complete exposure and risk-factor data were available for 45,513 children (76% of all births). A total of 42% of subjects had 1 or more physician visits for otitis media during follow-up. Adjusted estimates for NO, PM2.5, and woodsmoke were consistently elevated (eg, relative risk of 1.10 [95% confidence interval = 1.07-1.12] per interquartile range [IQR] increase in NO; 1.32 [1.27-1.36] per IQR increase in days of woodsmoke exposure). No increased risks were observed for the remaining pollutants (eg, 1.00 [0.98-1.03] per IQR increase in PM10; 0.99 [0.97-1.01] per IQR increase in black carbon).

In this study simulated upland grassland communities containing seven species were exposed to ozone treatments in solardomes for 12 weeks in each of two consecutive summers. Ozone profiles, based on future ozone predictions, were of elevated background concentrations, episodic peaks of ozone and a combination of the two. During the winter between the two exposures the communities were kept outdoors in ambient air. Whereas previous studies have demonstrated that peaks of ozone cause detrimental effects to vegetation, this study shows that for simulated grassland communities an increase in background ozone concentration in the absence of peaks of ozone also corresponded with increased senescence. In many cases senescence was further increased when peaks of ozone were also present. The species used showed no acclimation to ozone and the same relationship between senescence and ozone dose occurred in both years of the study. A decrease in cumulative biomass was demonstrated for Anthoxanthum odoratum, which contributed to a decrease in total community biomass and grass:forb ratio. These results indicate that current and future ozone concentrations could cause detrimental effects on growth and vitality of natural grassland communities and that for some species the consequences of increased background ozone concentration are as severe as that of increased peaks.",0,0,8.1.1.2,Grassland and Agricultural Land

We evaluated the effect of synoptic circulation patterns (air masses) on the association between ozone and hospital admissions for asthma and myocardial infarction (MI) among adults in North Carolina. 

Methods: Daily surface meteorology data (including precipitation, wind speed, and dew point) for five selected cities in North Carolina were obtained from the U.S. EPA Air Quality System (AQS), which were in turn based on data from the National Climatic Data Center of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. We used the Spatial Synoptic Classification system to classify each day of the 9-year period from 1996 through 2004 into one of seven different air mass types: dry polar, dry moderate, dry tropical, moist polar, moist moderate, moist tropical, or transitional. Daily 24-hour maximum 1-hour ambient concentrations of ozone were obtained from the AQS. Asthma and MI hospital admissions data for the 9-year period were obtained from the North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services. Generalized linear models were used to assess the association of the hospitalizations with ozone concentrations and specific air mass types, using pollutant lags of 0 to 5 days. We examined the effect across cities on days with the same air mass type. In all models we adjusted for dew point and day-of-the-week effects related to hospital admissions. 

Results: Ozone was associated with asthma under dry tropical (1- to 5-day lags), transitional (3- and 4-day lags), and extreme moist tropical (0-day lag) air masses. Ozone was associated with MI only under the extreme moist tropical (5-day lag) air masses. 

Conclusions: Elevated ozone levels are associated with dry tropical, dry moderate, and moist tropical air masses, with the highest ozone levels being associated with the dry tropical air mass.

One pathway may be through C-reactive protein, a biomarker of systemic inflammation that has been reported to increase the risk of preterm delivery. We examined whether air pollution influences serum concentrations of C-reactive protein in early pregnancy.
METHODS: We studied 1696 pregnant women in Allegheny County, PA, from 1997 through 2001. C-reactive protein concentrations were assayed in blood collected before the 22nd week of gestation. We estimated levels of particles of less than 10 ?m (PM10) and less than 2.5 ?m diameter (PM2.5), carbon monoxide, nitrogen dioxide, sulfur dioxide, and ozone at the maternal zip code using Kriging interpolation for measurements obtained from ambient stations. Associations between air pollution and high C-reactive protein concentrations (? 8 ng/mL) were evaluated using logistic regression.
RESULTS: Among nonsmokers, an observed 9.2 ?g/m increase in PM10 (averaged over 28 days prior to the blood sample) was associated with an odds ratios of 1.41 for high C-reactive protein concentrations (95% confidence interval = 0.99-2.00). Similarly, a 4.6 ?g/m increase in PM2.5 was associated with an odds ratio of 1.47 (1.05-2.06). The odds ratio was 1.49 (0.75-2.96) per 7.9 ppb increase in ozone during summer. There were no associations in smokers or for other air pollutants, and there was no evidence for effect-measure modification by obesity.

At least one mechanism underlying the lung toxicity of ozone involves excessive production of reactive oxygen and nitrogen intermediates such as peroxynitrite. In addition and beyond its major prooxidant properties, peroxynitrite may nitrate tyrosine residues altering phosphorylation of many protein kinases involved in cell signalling. It was recently proposed that peroxynitrite activates 5'-AMP-activated kinase (AMPK) which regulates metabolic pathways and the response to cell stress. AMPK activation as a consequence of ozone exposure has not been previously evaluated. First, we tested whether acute ozone exposure in mice would impair alveolar fluid clearance, increase lung tissue peroxynitrite production and activate AMPK. Second, we tested whether loss of AMP-activated protein kinase alpha1 subunit in mouse would prevent enhanced oxidative stress and lung injury induced by ozone exposure. METHODS: Control and AMPKalpha1 deficient mice were exposed to ozone at a concentration of 2.0 ppm for 3 h in glass cages. Evaluation was performed 24 h after ozone exposure. Alveolar fluid clearance (AFC) was evaluated using fluorescein isothiocyanate tagged albumin. Differential cell counts, total protein levels, cytokine concentrations, myeloperoxidase activity and markers of oxidative stress, i.e. malondialdehyde and peroxynitrite, were determined in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) and lung homogenates (LH). Levels of AMPK-Thr172 phosphorylation and basolateral membrane Na(+)-K(+)-ATPase abundance were determined by Western blot. RESULTS: In control mice, ozone exposure induced lung inflammation as evidence by increased leukocyte count, protein concentration in BAL and myeloperoxidase activity, pro-inflammatory cytokine levels in LH. Increases in peroxynitrite levels (3 vs 4.4 nM, p=0.02) and malondialdehyde concentrations (110 vs 230 umole/g wet tissue) were detected in LH obtained from ozone-exposed control mice. Ozone exposure consistently increased phosphorylated AMPK-Thr172 to total AMPK ratio by 80% in control mice. Ozone exposure causes increases in AFC and basolateral membrane Na(+)-K(+)-ATPase abundance in control mice which did not occur in AMPKalpha1 deficient mice. CONCLUSIONS: Our results collectively suggest that AMPK activation participates to ozone-induced increases in AFC, inflammation and oxidative stress. Further studies are needed to understand how the AMPK pathway may provide a novel approach for the prevention of ozone-induced lung injury.",0,0,3.1.4.4.2,Animal Toxicological Studies

A CXCR1/2 receptor antagonist has shown activity in an ozone challenge model in humans. What this study adds SB-656933, a selective CXCR2 antagonist, is safe and well-tolerated at single doses and is shown to inhibit agonist (CXCL1)-mediated expression of the CD11b on peripheral blood neutrophils as well as ozone-induced airway neutrophilia in healthy subjects. ABSTRACT: Aims To determine the safety and tolerability of a novel selective CXCR2 antagonist and assess its pharmacodynamic effects using measures of neutrophil activation and function, including CD11b expression in whole blood and ozone-induced airway inflammation in healthy subjects. Methods Flow cytometric determination of ex vivo CXCL1-induced CD11b expression on peripheral blood neutrophils was performed following single dose oral administration of SB-656933 (dose range 2-1100 mg). A subsequent randomized study (placebo, 50 mg and 150 mg) was performed to explore the dose-response for ozone-induced airway inflammation, as measured by sputum biomarkers. Results Oral administration of SB-656933 resulted in significant inhibition of CXCL1-induced CD11b expression on peripheral blood neutrophils at single doses greater than or equal to 50 mg. Maximum inhibition (70%) relative to placebo was observed following administration of SB-656933 400mg (95%CI: 60%, 77%). This was sustained up to a dose of 1100mg. Single doses of SB-656933 reduced ozone-induced airway inflammation in a dose-dependent manner. Relative to placebo, there were 55% [CI: 20%, 75%] and 74% [CI: 55%, 85%] fewer neutrophils in the sputum of subjects after a single dose of 50?mg or 150 mg, respectively.

Yet, little information exists on how effect estimates are impacted by the different exposure assessment methods employed in these studies.<br /><br /> To compare effect estimates for traffic-related air pollution exposure and preeclampsia, preterm birth (gestational age less than 37 weeks), and very preterm birth (gestational age less than 30 weeks) based on four commonly used exposure assessment methods.<br /><br /> We identified 81,186 singleton births during 1997-2006 at four hospitals in Los Angeles and Orange Counties, California.

We employed unconditional logistic regression to analyze preeclampsia in our birth cohort, while for gestational age-matched risk sets with preterm and very preterm birth we employed conditional logistic regression.<br /><br /> We observed elevated risks for preeclampsia, preterm birth, and very preterm birth from maternal exposures to traffic air pollutants measured at ambient stations (CO, NO, NO(2), and NO(x)) and modeled through CALINE4 (NO(x) and PM(2.5)) and LUR (NO(2) and NO(x)). Increased risk of preterm birth and very preterm birth were also positively associated with PM(10) and PM(2.5) air pollution measured at ambient stations. For LUR-modeled NO(2) and NO(x) exposures, elevated risks for all the outcomes were observed in Los Angeles only-the region for which the LUR models were initially developed. Unadjusted LUR models often produced odds ratios somewhat larger in size than temporally adjusted models. The size of effect estimates was smaller for exposures based on simpler traffic density measures than the other exposure assessment methods.<br /><br /> We generally confirmed that traffic-related air pollution was associated with adverse reproductive outcomes regardless of the exposure assessment method employed, yet the size of the estimated effect depended on how both temporal and spatial variations were incorporated into exposure assessment.

Seven months after the last period of exposure to the pollutant and just prior to budburst, upper-surface chlorisis affecting only the older needles of ozone-exposed trees was observed. In many respects, the symptoms appeared to be similar to those characteristic of type 1 spruce damage occurring in parts of mainland Europe. Chlorophyll pigments were reduced in the ozone-exposed older foliage, but no change in the ratio of chlorophylls to carotene was observed. The content of ascorbic acid was clearly related to the amount of foliar damage observed on the trees exposed to ozone and the largest increases were seen in those trees which were most visibly damaged. Although none of the foliage examined was deficient in any of the nutrient cations which were measured, the concentration of Mg in the older needles was significantly reduced by exposure to ozone, irrespective of damage symptoms. Exposure to ozone also resulted in increases in the ratios of K:Mg and Ca:Mg. In the older needles, leaching of Mg2+ and K+ by 0.5 mm H2SO4, pH 3.0, was enhanced by prior exposure to ozone, but the amounts removed were small (&lt; 6 %).

Plants received either filtered air or ozone; AOT40 exposures ranged from 9200 to 14 300 ppb h.  
Eight of the 12 species exhibited foliar injury in response to ozone exposure, with the first  
signs of injury on Vicia cracca, following an AOT40 exposure of only 1950 pbb h. Ozone exposure  
significantly reduced plant photosynthetic rate, stomatal conductance and biomass production in  
four species. Cirsium arvense exhibited the greatest biomass response to ozone (32% and 58%

They occur predominantly in industrialized regions, largely from fossil fuel combustion, but also from increased use of N fertilizers. Soil emissions of NO not only make an important contribution to global totals, but also play a part in regulating the dry deposition of NO and NO(2) (NO(x)) to plant canopies. Soil microbial production of NO leads to a soil 'compensation point' for NO deposition or emission, which depends on soil temperature, N and water status. In warm conditions, the net emission of NO(x) from plant canopies contributes to the photochemical formation of ozone. Moreover, the effect of NO(x) emissions from soil is to reduce net rates of NO(2) deposition to terrestrial surfaces over large areas.
<br>
<br>Increasing anthropogenic emissions of NO(x) have led to an approximate doubling in surface O(3) concentrations since the last century. NO(x) acts as a catalyst for the production of O(3) from volatile organic compounds (VOCs). Paradoxically, emission controls on motor vehicles might lead to increases in O(3) concentrations in urban areas.
<br>
<br>Removal of NO and NO(2) by dry deposition is regulated to some extent by soil production of NO; the major sink for NO(2) is stomatal uptake. Long-term flux measurements over moorland in Scotland show very small deposition rates for NO(2) at night and before mid-day of 1-4 ng NO(2)-N m(-2) s(-1), and similar emission rates during afternoon. The bi-directional flux gives 24-h average deposition velocities of only 1-2 mm s(-1), and implies a long life-time for NO(x) due to removal by dry deposition.
<br>
<br>Rates of removal of O(3) at the ground are also influenced by stomatal uptake, but significant non-stomatal uptake occurs at night and in winter. Measurements above moorland showed 40 % of total annual flux was stomatal, with 60% non-stomatal, giving nocturnal and winter deposition velocities of 2-3 mm s(-1) and daytime summer values of 10 mm s(-1). The stomatal uptake is responsible for adverse effects on vegetation. The critical level for O(3) exposure (AOT(40)) is used to derive a threshold O(3) stomatal flux for wheat of 0.5 mu g m(-2) s(-1). Use of modelled stomatal fluxes rather than exposure might give more reliable estimates of yield loss; preliminary calculations suggest that the relative grain yield reduction (%) can be estimated as 38 times the stomatal ozone flux (g m(-2)) above the threshold, summed over the growing season.",0,0,8.12.1,Nitrogen

Fumigations were performed at four ozone levels with 7-hr mean values of 0, 55, 67, and 71 ppb for 84 days. Results show that ozone injury symptoms occur to mesophyll cells of needles before visible needle injury (chlorotic mottle). The predominant injury to needles was cell necrosis. Ozone exposure-response relationships of exposure (ppm hr) percentage of dead cells showed a highly statistically significant (P &lt; 0.0001) linear relationship of y = 3.56 + 0.58 (x) with a correlation coefficient of 0.86.

effect size among studies was partitioned according to the presence of interacting stress  
factors, length of CO2 exposure, functional group status, pot size, and type of CO2 exposure

However, the underlying mechanisms by which soil microbes respond to these environmental changes remain poorly understood. The prevailing hypothesis, which states that CO?- or O?-induced changes in carbon (C) availability dominate microbial responses, is primarily based on results from nitrogen (N)-limiting forests and grasslands. It remains largely unexplored how soil microbes respond to elevated CO? and O? in N-rich or N-aggrading systems, which severely hinders our ability to predict the long-term soil C dynamics in agroecosystems. Using a long-term field study conducted in a no-till wheat-soybean rotation system with open-top chambers, we showed that elevated CO? but not O? had a potent influence on soil microbes. Elevated CO?(1.5?ambient) significantly increased, while O? (1.4?ambient) reduced, aboveground (and presumably belowground) plant residue C and N inputs to soil. However, only elevated CO? significantly affected soil microbial biomass, activities (namely heterotrophic respiration) and community composition. The enhancement of microbial biomass and activities by elevated CO? largely occurred in the third and fourth years of the experiment and coincided with increased soil N availability, likely due to CO?-stimulation of symbiotic N? fixation in soybean. Fungal biomass and the fungi?bacteria ratio decreased under both ambient and elevated CO? by the third year and also coincided with increased soil N availability; but they were significantly higher under elevated than ambient CO?.

However, C sequestration in forest soils may be offset by other environmental changes such as increasing tropospheric ozone (O-3) or vary based on species-specific growth responses to elevated CO2. To understand how projected increases in atmospheric CO2 and O-3 alter SOM formation, we used physical fractionation to characterize soil C and N at the Rhinelander Free Air CO2-O-3 Enrichment (FACE) experiment. Tracer amounts of (NH4+)-N-15 were applied to the forest floor of Populus tremuloides, P. tremuloides-Betula papynlera and P. tremuloides-Acer saccharum communities exposed to factorial CO2 and O-3 treatments. The N-15 tracer and strongly depleted C-13-CO2 were traced into SOM fractions over four years. Over time, C and N increased in coarse particulate organic matter (cPOM) and decreased in mineral-associated organic matter (MAOM) under elevated CO2 relative to ambient CO2. As main effects, neither CO2 nor O-3 significantly altered N-15 recovery in SOM. Elevated CO2 significantly increased new C in all SOM fractions, and significantly decreased old C in fine POM (fPOM) and MAOM over the duration of our study. Overall, our observations indicate that elevated CO2 has altered SOM cycling at this site to favor C and N accumulation in less stable pools, with more rapid turnover. Elevated O-3 had the opposite effect, significantly reducing cPOM N by 15% and significantly increasing the C:N ratio by 7%. Our results demonstrate that CO2 can enhance SOM turnover, potentially limiting long-term C sequestration in terrestrial ecosystems; plant community composition is an important determinant of the magnitude of this response.

We assessed the occurrence of apnea and bradycardia events in relation to speciated particulate matter and gaseous air pollution levels using a 2-day average of air pollution (same day and previous day), adjusting for temporal trends, temperature, and infant age.

Results: We observed associations between bradycardia and 8-hr maximum ozone [odds ratio (OR) = 1.049 per 25-ppb increase; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.021-1.078] and 1-hr maximum nitrogen dioxide (OR =1.025 per 20-ppb increase; 95% CI, 1.000-1.050). The association with ozone was robust to different methods of control for time trend and specified correlation structure. In secondary analyses, associations of apnea and bradycardia with pollution were generally stronger in infants who were full term and of normal birth weight than in infants who were both premature and LBW.

Conclusions: These results suggest that higher air pollution concentrations may increase the occurrence of apnea and bradycardia in high-risk infants.",0,0,7.4.1,Epidemiologic Studies

Objectives: We estimated associations between exposure to ambient air pollutants and stillbirth, with special reference to the assessment of gestational periods when the fetus is most susceptible.

Methods: We conducted a population-based case?control study in Taiwan. The case group consisted of 9,325 stillbirths, and the control group included 93,250 births randomly selected from 1,510,064 Taiwanese singleton newborns in 2001?2007. Adjusted logistic regression models were used to estimate odds ratios (ORs) per 10-ppb change for ozone and nitrogen dioxide, 1-ppb change for sulfur dioxide (SO2), 10-?g/m3 change for particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter ? 10 ?m (PM10), and 100-ppb change for carbon monoxide during different gestational periods and according to term or preterm (< 37 weeks) birth status.

Results: Stillbirth increased in association with a 1-ppb increase in first-trimester SO2 [adjusted OR = 1.02; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.00?1.04], particularly among preterm births (adjusted OR = 1.04; 95% CI, 1.01?1.07). Stillbirth was also associated with a 10-?g/m3 increase in PM10 during the first (adjusted OR = 1.02; 95% CI, 1.00?1.05) and second (adjusted OR = 1.02; 95% CI, 1.00?1.04) month of gestation, and, as with SO2, associations appeared to be restricted to preterm births (first-trimester adjusted OR = 1.03; 95% CI, 1.00?1.07).

Conclusion: The study provides evidence that exposure to outdoor air SO2 and PM10 may increase the risk of stillbirth, especially among preterm births, and that the most susceptible time periods for exposure are during the first trimester of gestation.",0,0,7.4.1,Epidemiologic Studies

The treatments were charcoal filtered air (FA), unfiltered air (UFA) and ambient air (AA). O-3, NO2, and SO2 concentrations recorded at the experimental site were 75, 29 and 18 ppb as 8 h daily mean, respectively. Microclimate conditions inside and outside the chamber environment remained virtually similar. All the rice cultivars showed severe depression in biomass (20-30%) due to reductions in number of tillers (20-27%) and leaves per plant (21-29%) during vegetative growth phase with maximum reductions seen in both Basmati-370 and IRRI-9 in UFA treatments compared with FA. These reductions were primarily due to decreased transpiration rate (10-20%), stomatal conductance (12-23%), net photosynthetic rate (9-22%) and photosynthetic efficiency (6-12%) of plants in UFA. Yield losses in total seed weight per plant in UFA were more or less similar in IRRI-9 (37%) and Basmati-370 (36%), followed by lower reduction in cv. Basmati-Pak (29%). Reductions in number of panicles per plant (18-25%), filled seeds per panicles (8-11%), seeds weight per panicle (13-17%) and 1000-seeds weight (5-8%) in UFA contributed significantly towards greater yield depression.

Objective: To measure the association between air pollution, spirometry, blood pressure, and exercise capacity.

Methods: We used data from 5604 subjects collected during the Canada Health Measures Survey to test the association between air pollution measured on the day of the survey and spirometry (n=5011 subjects), blood pressure, and exercise capacity (n=3789 subjects).

Results: An interquartile range (IQR) increase in ozone (17.0ppb) was significantly associated with a 0.883% higher resting heart rate, a 0.718% higher systolic and 0.407% higher diastolic blood pressure, a 0.393% lower FEV(1)/FVC expressed as a percentage of predicted, and a 1.52% reduction in the aerobic fitness score (p<0.05).

Design Time stratified case crossover study linking clinical data from the Myocardial Ischaemia National Audit Project (MINAP) with PM(10), ozone, CO, NO(2), and SO(2) data from the UK National Air Quality Archive. Pollution effects were investigated with delays (lags) of 1-6, 7-12, 13-18, 19-24, and 25-72 hours in both single and multi-pollutant models, adjusted for ambient temperature, relative humidity, circulating levels of influenza and respiratory syncytial virus, day of week, holidays, and residual seasonality within calendar month strata. Setting Population based study in 15 conurbations in England and Wales. Subjects 79 288 diagnoses of myocardial infarction recorded over the period 2003-6. Main outcome measures Excess risk of myocardial infarction per 10 mu g/m(3) increase in pollutant level. Results In single pollutant models, PM(10) and NO(2) levels were associated with a very short term increase in risk of myocardial infarction 1-6 hours later (excess risks 1.2% (95% confidence interval 0.3 to 2.1) and 1.1% (0.3 to 1.8) respectively per 10 mu g/m(3) increase); the effects persisted in multi-pollutant models, though with only weak evidence of an independent PM(10) effect (P=0.05). The immediate risk increases were followed by reductions in risk at longer lags: we found no evidence of any net excess risk associated with the five pollutants studied over a 72 hour period after exposure. Conclusions Higher levels of PM(10) and NO(2), which are typically markers of traffic related pollution, seem to be associated with transiently increased risk of myocardial infarction 1-6 hours after exposure, but later reductions in risk suggest that air pollution may be associated with bringing events forward in time (""short-term displacement"") rather than increasing overall risk.

Decadal means of ozone fields from transient climate-chemistry simulations (1960-2019) are analysed and the temporal development of ozone RF resulting from individual NO(x) sources, e.g. road traffic, industry and air traffic, is investigated. We calculated an ozone production efficiency which is mainly dependent on the altitude of NO(x) emission and on the amount of background NO(x) with values varying over one order of magnitude. Air traffic and lightning are identified as NO(x) sources with a two and five times higher ozone production efficiency, respectively, than ground based sources. Second, radiative efficiency of source attributed ozone (i.e. total induced radiative flux change per column ozone) shows clear dependence on latitudinal structure of the ozone anomaly and, to a lesser extent, to its altitude. Lightning induced ozone shows the highest radiative efficiency because lightning primarily enhances ozone in low latitudes in the mid-troposphere (higher altitudes). Superimposed on these effects, a saturation effect causes a decreasing radiative efficiency with increasing background ozone concentrations. Changes in RF attributed to NOx induced ozone from 1960 to 2019 are controlled by three factors: changes in emissions, changes in ozone production efficiency and changes in the radiative efficiency. Leading effect is emission increase, but changes in ozone production efficiency increase ozone RF by a factor of three for air traffic, or reduce ozone RF by around 30% for ships. Additionally, changes in the radiative efficiency due to saturation effects change ozone RF by 2-5%. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

A coarse-scale analysis of the temperature at an elevation of 850-mbar pressure (T850) for the period 1980-2004 was obtained from the National Center for Environmental Prediction (NCEP)/National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) Reanalysis data set for grid points near Upland (SoCAB) and Parlier (SJVAB). Daily 1-hour maximum ozone concentrations were obtained from the California Air Resources Board (CARB) for these locations over the same time period. The ozone concentrations measured at any given value of the Reanalysis T850 were approximately normally distributed. The 25%, 50%, and 75% quartile ozone concentrations increased linearly with T850, reflecting the effect of temperature on emissions and chemical reaction rates. A 2D Lagrangian (trajectory) form of the UCD/CIT photochemical air quality model was used in a perturbation study to explain the variability of the ozone concentrations at each value of T850. Wind speed, wind direction, temperature, relative humidity, mixing height, initial concentrations for VOC concentrations, background ozone concentrations, time of year, and overall emissions were perturbed in a realistic fashion during this study. A total of 62 model simulations were performed, and the results were analyzed to show that long-term changes to emissions inventories were the largest sources of ozone variability at a fixed value of T850. Projections of future T850 values in California were obtained from the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory (GFDL) model under the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) A2 and B1 emissions scenarios for the years 2001 to 2100. The future temperature trends combined with the historical statistical relationships suggest that an additional 22-30 days year(-1) in California would experience O-3 &gt;= 90 ppb under the A2 global emissions scenario, and an additional 6-13 days year(-1) would experience O-3 &gt;= 90 ppb under the B1 global emissions scenario by the year 2050 (assuming the NOx and VOC emissions remained at 1990-2004 levels).

Objectives: With preliminary reports linking O3 exposure with changes in heart rate (HR), we hypothesized that a single inhalation exposure to O3 will cause concentration-dependent autonomic modulation of cardiac function in rats. 

Methods: Rats implanted with telemeters to monitor HR and the electrocardiogram were exposed once by whole-body inhalation for 4 hr to 0.2 or 0.8 parts per million (ppm) O3 or filtered air. A separate cohort was tested for vulnerability to aconitine-induced arrhythmia 24 hr after exposure. 

Results: Exposure to 0.8 ppm O3 caused bradycardia, PR prolongation, ST depression, and substantial increases in atrial premature beats (APB), sinoatrial block (SAB) and atrioventricular block (AVB) accompanied by concurrent increases in several heart rate variability (HRV) parameters that were suggestive of increased parasympathetic tone. Low O3 exposure failed to elicit any overt changes in autonomic tone, heart rhythm or the electrocardiogram. However, both 0.2 and 0.8 ppm O3 increased sensitivity to aconitine-induced arrhythmia formation, suggesting a latent O3-induced alteration in myocardial excitability. 

Conclusions: O3 exposure causes several alterations in cardiac electrophysiology that are likely mediated by modulation of autonomic input to the heart. Moreover, exposure to low O3 concentrations may cause subclinical effects that are only manifested when triggered by a stressor, suggesting that the health effects of ambient levels of air pollutants may be insidious and potentially underestimated (This abstract does not reflect EPA policy).",0,0,3.1.6.3.1,Animal Toxicological Studies

Second, we investigate how enlarging the geographic area of inquiry influences the estimated effects. Third, because some air quality (AQ) measures are monitored less frequently than daily, we investigate the extent to which AQ measurement frequency can influence estimates of relationships with human mortality. Our analytical approach employs a Poisson regression model using generalized linear modeling in S-Plus to estimate the relationship between daily AQ measures and daily mortality counts. We show that the estimated effects and their associated t values vary by year for nine AQ measures (particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter < or =2.5 microm [PM2.5], elemental carbon [EC], organic carbon [OC], NO3, SO4, O3, NO2, CO, and SO2). Several of the estimated AQ effects show downward trends during the 9-year period of study. The estimated effects tend to be strongest for the AQ measurement during the day of death and tend to decrease with additional lags. Enlarging the geographic area from two to four counties in the metropolitan area decreased the estimated effects, perhaps partly due to the fact that the measurement site is located in one of the two original counties. Estimated effects utilizing data as if the AQ were only measured every 3rd or every 6th day each week or twice per week vary from lower to higher than that estimated with daily measurements, although the t values are lower, as expected.",0,0,3.1.9,Respiratory Mortality

In this study, time series of anthropogenic forcing of climate from pre-industrial times until 2010, for all well established forcing agents, are estimated. This includes presentation of RF histories of well mixed greenhouse gases, tropospheric ozone, direct-and indirect aerosol effects, surface albedo changes, stratospheric ozone and stratospheric water vapour. For long lived greenhouse gases, standard methods are used for calculating RF, based on global mean concentration changes. For short lived climate forcers, detailed chemical transport modelling and radiative transfer modelling using historical emission inventories is performed. For the direct aerosol effect, sulphate, black carbon, organic carbon, nitrate and secondary organic aerosols are considered. For aerosol indirect effects, time series of both the cloud lifetime effect and the cloud albedo effect are presented. Radiative forcing time series due to surface albedo changes are calculated based on prescribed changes in land use and radiative transfer modelling. For the stratospheric components, simple scaling methods are used. Long lived greenhouse gases (LLGHGs) are the most important radiative forcing agent with a RF of 2.83 +/- 0.28 W m(-2) in year 2010 relative to 1750. The two main aerosol components contributing to the direct aerosol effect are black carbon and sulphate, but their contributions are of opposite sign. The total direct aerosol effect was -0.48 +/- 0.32 W m(-2) in year 2010. Since pre-industrial times the positive RF (LLGHGs and tropospheric O-3) has been offset mainly by the direct and indirect aerosol effects, especially in the second half of the 20th century, which possibly lead to a decrease in the total anthropogenic RF in the middle of the century.

We have previously reported that ozone exposure can alter the anatomic distribution of CD25+ lymphocytes in airways of allergen-sensitized infant rhesus monkeys. Here, we hypothesized that ozone may also affect eosinophil trafficking to allergen-sensitized infant airways. To test this hypothesis, we measured blood, lavage, and airway mucosa eosinophils in 3-month old monkeys following cyclical ozone and house dust mite (HDM) aerosol exposures. We also determined if eotaxin family members (CCL11, CCL24, CCL26) are associated with eosinophil location in response to exposures. In lavage, eosinophil numbers increased in animals exposed to ozone and/or HDM. Ozone+HDM animals showed significantly increased CCL24 and CCL26 protein in lavage, but the concentration of CCL11, CCL24, and CCL26 was independent of eosinophil number for all exposure groups. In airway mucosa, eosinophils increased with exposure to HDM alone; comparatively, ozone and ozone+HDM resulted in reduced eosinophils. CCL26 mRNA and immunofluorescence staining increased in airway mucosa of HDM alone animals and correlated with eosinophil volume. In ozone+HDM animal groups, CCL24 mRNA and immunofluorescence increased along with CCR3 mRNA, but did not correlate with airway mucosa eosinophils. Cumulatively, our data indicate that ozone exposure results in a profile of airway eosinophil migration that is distinct from HDM mediated pathways. CCL24 was found to be induced only by combined ozone and HDM exposure, however expression was not associated with the presence of eosinophils within the airway mucosa.",0,0,3.2.3,Biological Plausibility

Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) is a pattern recognition receptor present on macrophages that has been implicated in sterile inflammatory responses. In the present studies we used TLR4 mutant C3H/HeJ mice to analyze the role of TLR4 in ozone-induced lung injury, oxidative stress and inflammation. Acute exposure of control C3H/HeOuJ mice to ozone (0.8ppm for 3h) resulted in increases in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) lipocalin 24p3 and 4-hydroxynonenal modified protein, markers of oxidative stress and lipid peroxidation. This was correlated with increases in BAL protein, as well as numbers of alveolar macrophages. Levels of surfactant protein-D, a pulmonary collectin known to regulate macrophage inflammatory responses, also increased in BAL following ozone inhalation. Ozone inhalation was associated with classical macrophage activation, as measured by increased NF-?B binding activity and expression of TNF? mRNA.

Out of 350,000 sudden cardiac deaths each year in the United States, 60,000 deaths have been linked to air pollution, suggesting a detrimental role of environmental pollutants in the development of CVD. This study tested the hypothesis that chronic ozone (O(3)) exposure diminishes myocardial function in healthy population. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were exposed 8 h/day for 28 and 56 days to filtered air or 0.8 ppm O(3). In vivo cardiac function was assessed by measuring LVDP, +dP/dt, -dP/dt, and LVEDP 24 h after termination of the O(3) exposure. Compared to rats exposed to filtered air, LVDP, +dP/dt, and -dP/dt were significantly decreased, and LVEDP was significantly increased in O(3) exposed animals. This attenuation of cardiac function was associated with increased myocardial TNF-alpha levels and lipid peroxidation as well as decreased myocardial activities of superoxidase dismutase and interleukin-10 levels.

To determine the role of adiponectin in the pulmonary inflammation induced by extended (48-72 h) low-dose (0.3 parts per million) exposure to ozone, adiponectin-deficient (Adipo(-/-)) and wild-type mice were exposed to ozone or to room air. In wild-type mice, ozone exposure increased total bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) adiponectin.

Moreover, compared with control Ab, anti-IL-17A Ab attenuated ozone-induced increases in BAL neutrophils and G-CSF in Adipo(-/-) but not in wild-type mice, suggesting that IL-17A, by promoting G-CSF release, contributed to augmented neutrophilia in Adipo(-/-) mice. Flow cytometric analysis of lung cells revealed that the number of CD45(+)/F4/80(+)/IL-17A(+) macrophages and ??

This system provides an advancement from offline coupling methods already in use. In RegCMCAMx, the radiative effects of tropospheric ozone, sulfates and black and organic carbon were considered. A series of annual sensitivity simulations were carried out for the year 2005 over a European domain, where ozone and/or aerosols were interactively coupled (taking their radiative feedbacks into account). The simulated concentrations of ozone, nitrogen dioxide, sulfur dioxide, sulfate and carbonaceous aerosol were validated against surface measurements. The coupling was evaluated by simulating 2 m temperature as well. The model satisfactorily reproduced near-surface ozone, especially in summer, and made reasonable predictions for monthly sulfate aerosol concentrations. Deficiencies were identified in simulating nitrogen (underprediction), sulfur oxides (overprediction) and carbonaceous aerosols (underprediction). The performance of the coupling system compared to non-coupled data was analyzed, and significant improvement of the model was found in terms of reproducing 2 m temperature, mainly for interactively coupled ozone. The short-term climate response of interactively coupled chemistry/aerosol was analyzed for the first time by this coupling model as well. The seasonally averaged temperature perturbation caused by coupled ozone/aerosols ranged from -1.5 to + 1.5 degrees C, not only near the surface but also at higher altitudes. Despite expectations, the surface radiative forcing due to aerosols did not correlate with the induced temperature changes, reflecting the complexity of the processes when ozone and/or aerosols perturb the overall dynamics of the atmosphere.

AIMS: The objective of this study was to investigate the association between particulate matter less than 2?5 and 10 microns in aerodynamic diameter, nitrogen dioxide, sulphur dioxide and ozone, and short-term risk of ischaemic stroke in Lyon, France. 

METHODS: The AVC69 study was a multicenter cohort study in which all consecutive adult patients admitted to one of the emergency or neurological departments of the Rhone area for suspicion of stroke were included during a seven-month period. Only patients with ischaemic stroke living within the study area, composed of Lyon and 18 neighbouring communities with homogenous air pollutants exposure, formed the basis of our study. We adopted a time-stratified case-crossover design to analyse the short-term effect (up to two-days) of air pollutants on ischaemic stroke incidence.

To determine the relevance to humans, we tested the association between daily air pollution concentrations and daily hospitalization for acute serious complications of diabetes, coma and ketoacidosis, in Santiago between 2001 and 2008, using generalized linear models with natural splines to control for long term trends. For an interquartile range (IQR) increase in air pollutant, the relative risks (95% CI) of hospitalization for diabetes were: 1.15 (1.10, 1.20) for carbon monoxide (IQR=1.00); 1.07 (0.98, 1.16) for ozone (IQR=63.50); 1.14 (1.06, 1.22) for sulfur dioxide (IQR=5.88); 1.12(1.05, 1.20) for nitrogen dioxide (IQR=27.94); 1.11 (1.07, 1.15) for particulate matter?10?m diameter(IQR=34.00); and 1.11 (1.06, 1.16) for fine particulate matter ?2.5?m diameter (IQR=18.50).

Two different exposure patterns were used: 5-day exposure per week (Ozone52) or 2-day exposure per week (Ozone25) with or without co-exposure to ultrafine particles (OPFP5252, OPFP5225). Airway architecture was evaluated at 81 days of age, after 56 days of continued development beyond the exposure period in filtered air (FA). By analyzing CT images from lung airway casts, we determined airway diameter, length, branching angle, and rotation angle for most conducting airways. Compared with the FA control group, the Ozone52 group showed significant decreases in airway diameter in generations larger than 10 especially in the right diaphragmatic lobe and in airway length in distal generations, while changes in airway structure due to the Ozone25 exposure were not appreciable. Interaction effects of ozone and ultrafine particle exposures were not significant. These results suggest that airway alterations due to postnatal ozone exposure are not limited to the distal region but occur extensively from the middle to distal conducting airways.

Exposure to house dust mite allergen (HDMA) and ozone (O3) leads to airway hyperreactivity and 5-HT-positive cells in the airway epithelium of infant rhesus monkeys. Research shows that concomitant exposure in allergic animals has an additive effect on airway hyperreactivity. 

Objectives: In this study, the hypothesis is that the exposure of allergic infant rhesus monkeys to HDMA, O3 and in combination, acting through 5-HT receptors, enhances 5-HT modulation of postganglionic cholinergic ASM contraction. 

Methods: Twenty-four HDMA-sensitized infant monkeys were split into 4 groups at the age of 1 month, and were exposed to filtered air (FA), HDMA, O3 or in combination (HDMA+O3). At the age of 6 months, airway rings were harvested and postganglionic, and parasympathetic-mediated ASM contraction was evaluated using electrical-field stimulation (EFS). 

Results: 5-HT exacerbated the EFS response within all exposure groups, but had no effect in the FA group. 5-HT2, 5-HT3 and 5-HT4 receptor agonists exacerbated the response. 5-HT concentration-response curves performed after incubation with specific receptor antagonists confirmed the involvement of 5-HT2, 5-HT3 and 5-HT4 receptors. Conversely, a 5-HT1 receptor agonist attenuated the tension across all groups during EFS, and in ASM contracted via exogenous acetylcholine. 

Conclusions: HDMA, O3 and HDMA+O3 exposure in a model of childhood allergic asthma enhances 5-HT exacerbation of EFS-induced ASM contraction through 5-HT2, 5-HT3 and 5-HT4 receptors.

We have investigated the association between ozone (O(3)) levels and hospital admissions and mortality due to cardiovascular and respiratory diseases for Prague inhabitants for summer months (April-September) over the 5-year period 2002-2006. Our hypothesis was that ambient O(3) levels in Prague resulted in adverse health outcomes and were associated with increased mortality and hospital admissions. METHODS: The effect of O(3) on mortality and hospital admissions was investigated using the negative binomial regression after controlling for the influence of meteorological factors (air temperature and relative humidity) and calendar effects (seasonal patterns, long-term trends and day of week). RESULTS: We found a statistically significant association between O(3) levels and daily mortality from respiratory diseases.

Chemical components of particulate matter <2.5?m (PM2.5) composition are spatially heterogeneous, which might contribute to discrepancies across PM2.5 studies.

Objectives: We explored whether birth weight at term is affected by PM2.5, PM10 and gaseous pollutants.

Methods: Exposures during gestation and each trimester were calculated for PM2.5 chemical components, PM10, PM2.5, carbon monoxide, nitrogen dioxide , ozone, and sulfur dioxide for births
in 2000-2007 for states in the northeastern and mid-Atlantic U.S. Associations between exposures and risk of low birth weight (LBW) were adjusted by family and individual characteristics and region. Interaction terms were used to investigate whether risk differs by race or sex.

Results: Several PM2.5 chemical components were associated with LBW. Risk increased 4.9% (95% confidence interval: 3.4, 6.5%), 4.7% (3.2, 6.2%), 5.7 (2.7, 8.8%) and 5.0% (3.1,7.0%) per interquartile range increase of PM2.5 aluminum, elemental carbon, nickel, and titanium, respectively.

Mice were exposed 1h/day for 10 consecutive days to: air, limonene (52 ppm/289 mg/m(3)); ozone (0.1 ppm/0.2mg/m(3)); a reaction mixture of limonene (52?8 ppm) and ozone (0.5, 2.5 and 3.9 ppm) resulting in ~0.05 ppm residual ozone. Neither the limonene nor the ozone exposures alone showed consistent effects on the respiratory parameters. In the limonene/ozone groups, the respiratory rate decreased concentration-dependently with an extrapolated no-effect-level of ~0.3 ppm admixed ozone. Both sensory irritation and airflow limitation were conspicuous effects of the mixtures; sensory irritation appeared rapidly and airflow limitation developed slowly during each exposure. The effects of these parameters did not change with increasing number of exposures. No firm conclusion could be drawn about alveolar level effects. Cells in bronchoalveolar lavage were unchanged irrespective of exposure to air, ozone, and limonene with and without ozone.

Mixed-effect models were used to estimate associations between air pollutants and IR indices on the same day or lagged up to 10 days prior, and effect modification by GSTM1, GSTT1, and GSTP1 genotypes.Results: Interquartile range increases in PM10, O3, and NO2 were significantly associated with IR indices, depending on the lag period. Associations were stronger among participants with a history of DM and among those with GSTM1-null, GSTT1-null, and GSTP1 AG or GG genotypes.Conclusions: Our results suggest that PM10, O3, and NO2 may increase IR in the elderly, and that GSTM1-null, GSTT1-null, and GSTP1 AG or GG genotypes may increase susceptibility to potential effects of ambient air pollutants on IR.",0,0,5.1.3.1.1,Epidemiologic Studies

Development of lung parenchyma in rhesus monkeys is rapid during the first 2 years of life (comparable to the first 6 years in humans). Our hypothesis is that ozone inhalation during infancy alters alveolar morphogenesis. We exposed infant rhesus monkeys biweekly to 5, 8 hr/day, cycles of 0.5 ppm ozone with or without house dust mite allergen from 1 to 3 or 1 to 6 months of age. Monkeys were necropsied at 3 and 6 months of age. A morphometric approach was used to quantify changes in alveolar volume and number, the distribution of alveolar size, and capillary surface density per alveolar septa. Quantitative real time PCR was used to measure the relative difference in gene expression over time. Monkeys exposed to ozone alone or ozone combined with allergen had statistically larger alveoli that were less in number at 3 months of age. Alveolar capillary surface density was also decreased in the ozone exposed groups at 3 months of age. At 6 months of age, the alveolar number was similar between treatment groups and was associated with a significant rise in alveolar number from 3 to 6 months of age in the ozone exposed groups. This increase in alveolar number was not associated with any significant increase in microvascular growth as measured by morphometry or changes in angiogenic gene expression. Inhalation of ozone during infancy alters the appearance and timing of alveolar growth and maturation.

In the current study, we test two hypotheses: 1) the cardiac compensatory changes in response to air pollution are dependent on its composition, and 2) specific cardiac adaptations are regulated by atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP). We address these hypotheses by initially examining the exposure effects of ozone (O(3)) and/or particulate matter (PM) on cardiac function in C57Bl/6J (B6) mice. Subsequently, the results are compared with cardiac functional changes to the same exposures in Nppa (the precursor gene for ANP) KO mice. Separate groups of mice underwent 3 consecutive days of the same exposure sequence for 3 hrs each consisting of the following: 1) 6 hrs of filtered air (FAFA), 2) O(3) then FA (O(3)FA), 3) FA then carbon black (FACB), or 4) O(3) then CB (O(3)CB). Cardiac function was assessed using a conductance catheter to generate cardiac pressure-volume (PV) loops 8-10 hrs following each exposure sequence. As compared to FAFA, each sequence led to a substantial drop (as much as 33%) in stroke volume and cardiac output. However, these losses of cardiac function occurred by different compensatory mechanisms dependent on the pollutant composition. For example, O(3)FA exposure led to reductions in both end-systolic and end-diastolic left ventricular (LV) volumes, while FACB exposure led an increase in end-diastolic LV volume. These same cardiac compensatory changes were largely abolished in Nppa KO mice following O(3)FA or FACB exposure. These results suggest that cardiac functional changes in response to air pollution exposure are strongly dependent on the pollutant constituents, especially related to O(3) and/or PM. Furthermore, ANP regulation appears to be crucial to these cardiac compensatory mechanisms induced by air pollution.",0,0,3.1.4.4.2,Animal Toxicological Studies

OBJECTIVES: To obtain maximum likelihood estimates of the common national effects of the criteria pollutants on mortality based on time-series data from up to 108 metropolitan areas in the U.S. METHODS: We used a subsampling bootstrap procedure to obtain the maximum likelihood estimates and confidence bounds for common national effects of the criteria pollutants, as measured by the percentage increase in daily mortality associated with a unit increase in daily 24-hour mean pollutant concentration on the previous day, while controlling weather and temporal trends. Five pollutants, PM10, ozone, CO, NO2, and SO2 were considered in single and multi-pollutant analyses. Flexible ambient concentration-response models for the pollutant effects were considered as well. Limited sensitivity analyses with different degrees of freedom for time trends were performed. RESULTS: In single pollutant models, we observed significant associations of daily deaths with all pollutants. The ozone coefficient was highly sensitive to the degree of smoothing of time trends. Among the gases, SO2 and NO2 were most strongly associated with mortality. The flexible ambient concentration-response curve for ozone showed evidence of non-linearity and a threshold at about 30 ppb. CONCLUSIONS: Differences between the results of our analyses and those reported from the Bayesian approach suggest that estimates of the quantitative impact of pollutants are dependent on choice of statistical approach, although results are not directly comparable because they are based on different data.

OBJECTIVES: We studied the influence of exposures to traffic-related air pollution during pregnancy on the development of autism using data from air monitoring stations and a land use regression (LUR) model to estimate exposures. 

METHODS: Children of mothers who gave birth in Los Angeles who were diagnosed with a primary AD diagnosis at ages 3-5 years during 1998-2009 were identified through the California Department of Developmental Services and linked to 1995-2006 California birth certificates. For 7,603 children with autism and 10 controls per case matched by sex, birth year, and minimum gestational age, birth addresses were mapped and linked to the nearest air monitoring station and a LUR model. We used conditional logistic regression, adjusting for maternal and perinatal characteristics including indicators of SES. 

RESULTS: Per interquartile range (IQR) increase, we estimated a 12-15% relative increase in odds of autism for O3 (OR = 1.12, 95% CI: 1.06, 1.19; per 11.54 ppb increase) and PM2.5 (OR = 1.15, 95% CI: 1.06, 1.24; per 4.68 ?g/m3 increase) when mutually adjusting for both pollutants.

METHODS: Events were identified from primary care records, hospital admissions, and death certificates. Annual average concentrations in 2002 for particulate matter with a median aerodynamic diameter <10 (PM10) and <2.5 microns, nitrogen dioxide (NO2), ozone, and sulfur dioxide at a 1 ? 1 km resolution were derived from emission-based models and linked to residential postcode.

Air pollution concentrations were obtained from an extensive area monitor network. An average increase of 6 ?g/m(3) in PM(2.5) 2 days before onset was associated with an increased risk of OHCA (1.046; 95% CI 1.012 to 1.082).

Perivascular edema and vascular congestion were also evident, along with decreases in Clara cell secretory protein in bronchoalveolar lavage, which was maximal 24 h post exposure. Ozone also induced the appearance of 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine, Ym1 and heme oxygenase-1 in the bronchiolar epithelium. This was associated with increased expression of cleaved caspase-9 and beclin-1, indicating initiation of apoptosis and autophagy. A rapid and persistent increase in galectin-3, a regulator of epithelial cell apoptosis, was also observed. Following ozone exposure (3-24 h) increased expression of cyclooxygenase-2, inducible nitric oxide synthase and arginase-1 was noted in bronchiolar epithelium. Ozone-induced injury and oxidative stress in bronchiolar epithelium were linked to methacholine-induced alterations in pulmonary mechanics. Thus, significant increases in lung resistance and elastance, along with decreases in lung compliance and end tidal volume were observed at higher doses of methacholine. This indicates that ozone causes an increase in effective stiffness of the lung, as a consequence of changes in the conducting airways.

Complementary metrics capturing different aspects of air pollution were used (measurements from ambient monitoring stations, predictions from land use regression models and from a Gaussian dispersion model, traffic density, and proximity to roads). Associations between air pollution metrics and birth outcomes were investigated using generalized additive models, adjusting for maternal age, parity, race/ethnicity, insurance status, poverty, gestational age and sex of the infants.<br /><br /><strong>RESULTS: </strong>Increased risks of LBW were associated with ambient O3 concentrations as measured by monitoring stations, as well as traffic density and proximity to major roadways. LBW was not significantly associated with other air pollution metrics, except that a decreased risk was associated with ambient NO2 concentrations as measured by monitoring stations.

We assessed the association between ambient pollutant concentrations and term birth weight for 1,548,904 births in TX from 1998 to 2004. Assignment of prenatal exposure to air pollutants was based on maternal county of residence at the time of delivery. Pollutants examined included particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter &lt; or = 10 and &lt; or = 2.5 microm (PM10 and PM2.5), sulfur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), carbon monoxide (CO), and ozone (O3). We applied a linear model with birth weight as a continuous variable. The model was adjusted for known risk factors and region. We assessed pollutant effects by trimester to identify biological exposure window of concern, and explored interaction due to race/ethnicity. An interquartile increase in ambient pollutant concentrations of SO2 and O3 was associated with a 4.99-g (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.87-8.11) and 2. 72-g (95% CI, 1.11-4.33) decrease in birth weight, respectively.

In these experiments, we analyzed the effects of chronic macrophage inflammation attributable to loss of Sftpd on the persistence of ozone-induced injury, macrophage activation, and altered functioning in the lung. Wild-type (Sftpd(+/+)) and Sftpd(-/-) mice (aged 8 wk) were exposed to air or ozone (0.8 parts per million, 3 h). Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid and tissue were collected 72 hours later. In Sftpd(-/-) mice, but not Sftpd(+/+) mice, increased BAL protein and nitrogen oxides were observed after ozone inhalation, indicating prolonged lung injury and oxidative stress. Increased numbers of macrophages were also present in BAL fluid and in histologic sections from Sftpd(-/-) mice. These cells were enlarged and foamy, suggesting that they were activated. This conclusion was supported by findings of increased BAL chemotactic activity, and increased expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase in lung macrophages. In both Sftpd(+/+) and Sftpd(-/-) mice, inhalation of ozone was associated with functional alterations in the lung. Although these alterations were limited to central airway mechanics in Sftpd(+/+) mice, both central airway and parenchymal mechanics were modified by ozone exposure in Sftpd(-/-) mice. The most notable changes were evident in resistance and elastance spectra and baseline lung function, and in lung responsiveness to changes in positive end-expiratory pressure. These data demonstrate that a loss of Sftpd is associated with prolonged lung injury, oxidative stress, and macrophage accumulation and activation in response to ozone, and with more extensive functional changes consistent with the loss of parenchymal integrity.",0,0,3.1.4.3.2,Animal Toxicological Studies

Evidence suggests that macrophages play a role in the pathogenic response; however, their contribution depends on the mediators they encounter in the lung which dictate their function. In these studies we analyzed the effects of ozone-induced oxidative stress on the phenotype of alveolar macrophages (AM). Exposure of rats to ozone (2 ppm, 3h) resulted in increased expression of 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG), as well as heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) in AM. Whereas 8-OHdG was maximum at 24h, expression of HO-1 was biphasic increasing after 3h and 48-72 h. Cleaved caspase-9 and beclin-1, markers of apoptosis and autophagy, were also induced in AM 24h post-ozone. This was associated with increased bronchoalveolar lavage protein and cells, as well as matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2 and MMP-9, demonstrating alveolar epithelial injury. Ozone intoxication resulted in biphasic activation of the transcription factor, NF?B. This correlated with expression of monocyte chemotactic protein-1, inducible nitric oxide synthase and cyclooxygenase-2, markers of proinflammatory macrophages. Increases in arginase-1, Ym1 and galectin-3 positive anti-inflammatory/wound repair macrophages were also observed in the lung after ozone inhalation, beginning at 24h (arginase-1, Ym1), and persisting for 72 h (galectin-3). This was associated with increased expression of pro-surfactant protein-C, a marker of Type II cell proliferation and activation, important steps in wound repair.

cycling and N2O emissions are responsive to adaptive management. We investigated the interaction  
of soil moisture content with eCO(2) and eO(3) on potential N2O emissions from SoyFACE during a  
28-day laboratory incubation experiment. We also assessed field N2O fluxes during 2 soybean- 
growing seasons. In addition, we sought to link previously observed changes in soybean growth and  
production to belowground processes over a longer time scale by analyzing changes in natural  
abundance stable isotope ratios of soil N (delta N-15). This method relies on the concept that  
soil delta N-15 can only change when inputs or outputs with an isotope signature different from  
that of soil N are altered. We found no major effects of eCO(2) and eO(3) on laboratory and field  
measured N2O emissions. Natural abundance isotope analyses suggested, however, a decrease in  
belowground allocation of biologically fixed N in combination with decreased total gaseous N loss  
by eCO(2), resulting in a tighter N cycle in the longer-term. In contrast, the isotope data  
suggested an increase in belowground allocation of biologically fixed N under eO(3), leading to  
increased gaseous N loss, most likely in the form of N-2. Given that effects of eCO(2) and eO(3)  
on N pools and instantaneous transformation rates in surface soil layers of this agroecosystem  
have been minimal, our results illustrate the importance of evaluating longer-term changes in N  
turnover rates. We conclude that eCO(2) decelerates whereas eO(3) accelerates N-cycling in the  
longer-term, but feedback through changed N2O emissions is not occurring in this soybean system.

Single-pollutant analyses used daily cardiovascular mortality, fine particulate matter (particles with an aerodynamic diameter ?2.5 ?m; PM(2.5)), speciated PM(2.5), and gaseous pollutant data, while multipollutant analyses used source factors identified through principal component analysis. In single-pollutant analyses, risk estimates were relatively consistent across models for most PM(2.5) components and gaseous pollutants. However, risk estimates were inconsistent for ozone in all-year and warm-season analyses. Principal component analysis yielded factors with species associated with traffic, crustal material, residual oil, and coal. Risk estimates for these factors exhibited less sensitivity to alternative regression models compared with single-pollutant models. Factors associated with traffic and crustal material showed consistently positive associations in the warm season, while the coal combustion factor showed consistently positive associations in the cold season.

This rate has increased steadily in the past decade. There are significant, persistent, and very troubling racial, ethnic, and socioeconomic disparities in the rates of preterm birth. The highest rates are for non-Hispanic African Americans, and the lowest are for Asians or Pacific Islanders. In 2003, the rate for African-American women was 17.8 percent, whereas the rates were 10.5 percent for Asian and Pacific Islander women and 11.5 percent for white women. The most notable increases from 2001 to 2003 were for white non-Hispanic, American Indian, and Hispanic groups. Infants born preterm are at greater risk than infants born at term for mortality and a variety of health and developmental problems. Complications include acute respiratory, gastrointestinal, immunologic, central nervous system, hearing, and vision problems, as well as longer-term motor, cognitive, visual, hearing, behavioral, social-emotional, health, and growth problems. The birth of a preterm infant can also bring considerable emotional and economic costs to families and have implications for public-sector services, such as health insurance, educational, and other social support systems. The annual societal economic burden associated with preterm birth in the United States was at least $26.2 billion in 2005. The greatest risk of mortality and morbidity is for those infants born at the earliest gestational ages. However, those infants born nearer to term represent the greatest number of infants born preterm and also experience more complications than infants born at term. Preterm birth is a complex cluster of problems with a set of overlapping factors of influence. Its causes may include individual-level behavioral and psychosocial factors, neighborhood characteristics, environmental exposures, medical conditions, infertility treatments, biological factors, and genetics. Many of these factors occur in combination, particularly in those who are socioeconomically disadvantaged or who are members of racial and ethnic minority groups. The current methods for the diagnosis and treatment of preterm labor are currently based on an inadequate literature, and little is know about how preterm birth can be prevented. Treatment has been focused on inhibiting contractions. This has not reduced the incidence of preterm birth but has delayed delivery long enough to allow the administration of antenatal steroids and transfer of the mother and fetus to a hospital where they may receive appropriate care. These interventions have reduced the rates of perinatal mortality and morbidity. Although improvements in perinatal and neonatal care have significantly improved the rates of survival for infants born preterm, these infants remain at risk for a host of acute and chronic health problems. Therapies and interventions for the prediction and the prevention of preterm birth are thus needed. Upon review of the literature assessing the causes and consequences of preterm birth, the diagnosis and treatment of women at risk for preterm labor, and treatments for infants born preterm, the committee proposes a research agenda for investigating the problem of preterm birth that is intended to help focus and direct research efforts. Priority areas are: (1) the establishment of multidisciplinary research centers; (2) improved research in three areas including better definition of the problem of preterm birth with improved data, clinical and health services research investigations, and etiologic and epidemiologic investigations; and (3) the study and informing of public policy.

The ensemble mean compares well against present day observations. The seasonal cycle correlates well, except for some locations in the tropical upper troposphere. Most (75%) of the models are encompassed with a range of global mean tropospheric ozone column estimates from satellite data, but there is a suggestion of a high bias in the Northern Hemisphere and a low bias in the Southern Hemisphere, which could indicate deficiencies with the ozone precursor emissions. Compared to the present day ensemble mean tropospheric ozone burden of 337 +/- 23 Tg, the ensemble mean burden for 1850 time slice is similar to 30% lower. Future changes were modelled using emissions and climate projections from four Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs). Compared to 2000, the relative changes in the ensemble mean tropospheric ozone burden in 2030 (2100) for the different RCPs are: -4% (-16%) for RCP2.6, 2% (-7%) for RCP4.5, 1% (-9%) for RCP6.0, and 7% (18%) for RCP8.5. Model agreement on the magnitude of the change is greatest for larger changes. Reductions in most precursor emissions are common across the RCPs and drive ozone decreases in all but RCP8.5, where doubled methane and a 40-150% greater stratospheric influx (estimated from a subset of models) increase ozone. While models with a high ozone burden for the present day also have high ozone burdens for the other time slices, no model consistently predicts large or small ozone changes; i.e. the magnitudes of the burdens and burden changes do not appear to be related simply, and the models are sensitive to emissions and climate changes in different ways. Spatial patterns of ozone changes are well correlated across most models, but are notably different for models without time evolving stratospheric ozone concentrations. A unified approach to ozone budget specifications and a rigorous investigation of the factors that drive tropospheric ozone is recommended to help future studies attribute ozone changes and inter-model differences more clearly.",0,0,9.2.2,Recent Evidence of Radiative Forcing Temporal and Spatial Trends

All models applied a common set of anthropogenic emissions, which are better constrained for the present-day than the past. Future anthropogenic emissions follow the four Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) scenarios, which define a relatively narrow range of possible air pollution emissions. We calculate a value for the pre-industrial (1750) to present-day (2010) tropospheric ozone RF of 410 mW m(-2). The model range of pre-industrial to present-day changes in O-3 produces a spread (+/- 1 standard deviation) in RFs of +/- 17 %. Three different radiation schemes were used we find differences in RFs between schemes (for the same ozone fields) of +/- 10 %. Applying two different tropopause definitions gives differences in RFs of +/- 3 %. Given additional (unquantified) uncertainties associated with emissions, climate-chemistry interactions and land-use change, we estimate an overall uncertainty of +/- 30% for the tropospheric ozone RF. Experiments carried out by a subset of six models attribute tropospheric ozone RF to increased emissions of methane (44 +/- 12 %), nitrogen oxides (31 +/- 9 %), carbon monoxide (15 +/- 3 %) and non-methane volatile organic compounds (9 +/- 2 %); earlier studies attributed more of the tropospheric ozone RF to methane and less to nitrogen oxides. Normalising RFs to changes in tropospheric column ozone, we find a global mean normalised RF of 42 mW m(-2) DU-1, a value similar to previous work. Using normalised RFs and future tropospheric column ozone projections we calculate future tropospheric ozone RFs (mW m(-2); relative to 1750) for the four future scenarios (RCP2.6, RCP4.5, RCP6.0 and RCP8.5) of 350, 420, 370 and 460 (in 2030), and 200, 300, 280 and 600 (in 2100). Models show some coherent responses of ozone to climate change: decreases in the tropical lower troposphere, associated with increases in water vapour; and increases in the sub-tropical to mid-latitude upper troposphere, associated with increases in lightning and stratosphere-to-troposphere transport.

interpreted to suggest that the concentration of atmospheric oxygen was only 1-10% of the present  
level in the time interval from 750 to 580 million years ago when several nearly global  
glaciations or Snowball Earth events occurred. This low concentration of oxygen would have been  
accompanied by a lower ozone concentration than exists at present. Since ozone is a greenhouse  
gas, this change in ozone concentration would alter surface temperature, and thereby could have  
an important influence on the climate of the Snowball Earth. Previous works that have focused  
either on initiation or deglaciation of the proposed Snowball Earth has not taken the radiative  
effects of ozone changes into account. We address this issue herein by performing a series of  
simulations using an atmospheric general circulation model with various ozone concentrations. Our  
simulation results demonstrate that, as ozone concentration is uniformly reduced from 100% to 50  
%, surface temperature decreases by approximately 0.8K at the Equator, with the largest decreases  
located in the middle latitudes reaching as high as 2.5 K. When ozone concentration is reduced  
and its vertical and horizontal distribution is simultaneously modulated, surface temperature  
decreases by 0.4-1.0K at the Equator and by 4-7K in polar regions. These results here have  
uncertainties, depending on model parameterizations of cloud, surface snow albedo, and relevant  
feedback processes, while they are qualitatively consistent with radiative-convective model  
results that do not involve such parameterizations and feedbacks. These results suggest that

Many aspects of how inhomogeneous radiative forcings influence precipitation remain unclear, however. Here we investigate regional precipitation responses to various forcings imposed in different latitude bands in a climate model. We find that several regions show strong, significant responses to most forcings, but that the magnitude and even the sign depends upon the forcing location and type. Aerosol and ozone forcings typically induce larger responses than equivalent carbon dioxide (CO2) forcing, and the influence of remote forcings often outweighs that of local forcings. Consistent with this, ozone and especially aerosols contribute greatly to precipitation changes over the Sahel and South and East Asia in historical simulations, and inclusion of aerosols greatly increases the agreement with observed trends in these areas, which cannot be attributed to either greenhouse gases or natural forcings. Estimates of precipitation responses derived from multiplying our Regional Precipitation Potentials (RPP; the response per unit forcing relationships) by historical forcings typically capture the actual response in full transient climate simulations fairly well, suggesting that these relationships may provide useful metrics. The strong sensitivity to aerosol and ozone forcing suggests that although some air quality improvements may unmask greenhouse gas-induced warming, they have large benefits for reducing regional disruption of the hydrologic cycle.",0,0,9.3.2.1,Precipitation

Methods: We investigated lung cancer incidence in relation to long-term exposure to three ambient air pollutants and proximity to major roads, using a Canadian population-based case-control study. We compared 2,390 incident, histologically confirmed lung cancer cases with 3,507 population controls in eight Canadian provinces from 1994 to 1997. We developed spatiotemporal models for the whole country to estimate annual residential exposure to fine particulate matter (PM2.5), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), and ozone (O3) over a 20-year exposure period. We carried out a subanalysis in urban centers, using exposures derived from fixed-site air pollution monitors, and also examined traffic proximity measures. Hierarchical logistic regression models incorporated a comprehensive set of individual and geographic covariates.

Results: The increase in lung cancer incidence (expressed as fully adjusted odds ratios [ORs]) was 1.29 (95% confidence interval = 0.95?1.76) with a ten-unit increase in PM2.5 (?g/m3), 1.11 (1.00?1.24) with a ten-unit increase in NO2 (ppb), and 1.09 (0.85?1.39) with a ten-unit increase in O3 (ppb). The urban monitor-based subanalyses generally supported the national results, with larger associations for NO2 (OR = 1.34; 1.07?1.69) per 10 ppb increase. No dose-response trends were observed, and no clear relationships were found for specific histological cancer subtypes. There was the suggestion of increased risk among those living within 100 m of highways, but not among those living near major roads.

OBJECTIVE: In a pooled analysis of 6 birth cohorts (Ntotal = 15,299), we examined whether TRAP and genetic polymorphisms related to inflammation and oxidative stress predict allergic rhinitis and sensitization. METHODS: Allergic rhinitis was defined with a doctor diagnosis or reported symptoms at age 7 or 8 years. Associations between nitrogen dioxide, particulate matter 2.5 (PM2.5) mass, PM2.5 absorbance, and ozone, estimated for each child at the year of birth, and single nucleotide polymorphisms within the GSTP1, TNF, TLR2, or TLR4 genes with allergic rhinitis and aeroallergen sensitization were examined with logistic regression. Models were stratified by genotype and interaction terms tested for gene-environment associations. RESULTS: Point estimates for associations between nitrogen dioxide, PM2.5 mass, and PM2.5 absorbance with allergic rhinitis were elevated, but only that for PM2.5 mass was statistically significant (1.37 [1.01, 1.86] per 5 ?g/m(3)).

Heart rate (HR) and electrocardiogram (ECG) was monitored at approximately 24-h both after the 3rd exposure and the last (6th) exposure, and systolic blood pressure (SBP) was monitored at approximately 24-h after the 6th exposure. Biomarkers of systemic inflammation and injuries (CRP, IL-6, LDH, CK), heart oxidative stress (MDA, SOD) and endothelial function (ET-1, VEGF) were analyzed after the 6th exposure. Additionally, myocardial ultrastructural alterations were observed under transmission electron microscopy (TEM) for histopathological analyses. Results showed that PM(2.5) alone exposure could trigger the significant increase of CRP, MDA, CK, ET-1 and SBP and decrease of heart rate variability (HRV), a marker of cardiac autonomic nervous system (ANS) function.

This expansion is important because it is associated with shifts in large-scale atmospheric circulation and major climate zones. Although recent studies have attributed tropical expansion in the Southern Hemisphere to ozone depletion, the drivers of Northern Hemisphere expansion are not well known and the expansion has not so far been reproduced by climate models. Here we use a climate model with detailed aerosol physics to show that increases in heterogeneous warming agents--including black carbon aerosols and tropospheric ozone--are noticeably better than greenhouse gases at driving expansion, and can account for the observed summertime maximum in tropical expansion. Mechanistically, atmospheric heating from black carbon and tropospheric ozone has occurred at the mid-latitudes, generating a poleward shift of the tropospheric jet, thereby relocating the main division between tropical and temperate air masses. Although we still underestimate tropical expansion, the true aerosol forcing is poorly known and could also be underestimated. Thus, although the insensitivity of models needs further investigation, black carbon and tropospheric ozone, both of which are strongly influenced by human activities, are the most likely causes of observed Northern Hemisphere tropical expansion.",0,0,9.3.2.2,Atmospheric Circulation

Objective: To find possible predictors of functional and inflammatory airway response to ozone in asthmatic patients.

Materials and methods: We studied 120 patients with mild-to-moderate asthma, randomly exposed to either air or ozone (0.3 ppm for 2 h) in a challenge chamber. Symptoms and pulmonary function test (PFT) were measured before and immediately after exposure. Six hours after exposure, induced sputum was collected. Patients were evaluated according to their functional (FEV1 responders) or neutrophilic (neutrophil responders) response to ozone. We considered, as possible predictors of response: age, baseline FEV1, previous treatment with inhaled corticosteroids (ICS), baseline sputum neutrophils, baseline sputum eosinophils, methacholine responsiveness, atopy and smoking habit.

Results: FEV1 responders had lower baseline FEV1, and a lower percentage of these had received ICS treatment. Neutrophil responders were younger, with lower baseline sputum inflammation and greater methacholine responsiveness. These results were confirmed by multivariate logistic analysis.

Discussion and conclusion: Patients not previously treated with ICS and patients with lower FEV1 are more prone to functional response to ozone. Lower baseline airway inflammation and greater bronchial hyperresponsiveness may predict neutrophilic airway response to ozone in asthmatic patients.

The current configuration focuses on CAM4 radiation with the constituents as represented in present-day conditions in CESM1, along with their optical properties. PORT includes an implementation of stratospheric temperature adjustment under the assumption of fixed dynamical heating, which is necessary to compute radiative forcing in addition to the more straightforward instantaneous radiative forcing. PORT can be extended to use radiative constituent distributions from other models or model simulations. Ultimately, PORT can be used with various radiative transfer models. As illustrations of the use of PORT, we perform the computation of radiative forcing from doubling of carbon dioxide, from the change of tropospheric ozone concentration from the year 1850 to 2000, and from present-day aerosols.

By using a process-based ecosystem model, the Dynamic Land Ecosystem Model (DLEM), in conjunction with the newly developed driving information on multiple environmental factors (climate, atmospheric CO2 , tropospheric ozone, nitrogen deposition, and land cover/land use change), we quantified spatial and temporal patterns of net primary production (NPP) and soil organic carbon storage (SOC) across China's croplands during 1980-2005 and investigated the underlying mechanisms. Simulated results showed that both crop NPP and SOC increased from 1980 to 2005, and the highest annual NPP occurred in the Southeast (SE) region (0.32 Pg C yr(-1) , 35.4% of the total NPP) whereas the largest annual SOC (2.29 Pg C yr(-1) , 35.4% of the total SOC) was found in the Northeast (NE) region.

The pattern recognition receptor CD36 interacts with many damage-related circulating molecules, leading to activation of endothelial cells and promoting vascular inflammation; therefore, we hypothesized that CD36 plays a pivotal role in mediating cross talk between inhaled ozone (O3)-induced circulating factors and systemic vascular dysfunction. O3 exposure (1 ppm ? 4h) induced lung inflammation in wild-type (WT) mice, which was absent in the CD36 deficient (CD36(-/-)) mice. Acetylcholine (ACh)-evoked vasorelaxation was impaired in isolated aortas from O3-exposed WT mice but not in vessels from CD36(-/-) mice. To delineate whether vascular impairments were caused by lung inflammation or CD36-mediated generation of circulating factors, naive aortas were treated with diluted serum from control or O3-exposed WT mice, which recapitulated the impairments of vasorelaxation observed after inhalation exposures. Aortas from CD36(-/-) mice were insensitive to the effects of O3-induced circulating factors, with robust vasorelaxation responses in the presence of serum from O3-exposed WT mice. Lung inflammation was not a requirement for production of circulating vasoactive factors, as serum from O3-exposed CD36(-/-) mice could inhibit vasorelaxation in naive WT aortas. These results suggest that O3 inhalation induces the release of circulating bioactive factors capable of impairing vasorelaxation to ACh via a CD36-dependent signaling mechanism.

To gain insight into mechanisms underlying such effects, we mapped gene profiles in the lungs, heart, liver, kidney, spleen, cerebral hemisphere, and pituitary of male Fischer-344 rats immediately and 24h after a 4-h exposure by inhalation to particulate matter (0, 5, and 50mg/m(3) EHC-93 urban particles) and ozone (0, 0.4, and 0.8 ppm). Pollutant exposure provoked differential expression of genes involved in a number of pathways, including antioxidant response, xenobiotic metabolism, inflammatory signalling, and endothelial dysfunction. The mRNA profiles, while exhibiting some interorgan and pollutant-specific differences, were remarkably similar across organs for a set of genes, including increased expression of redox/glucocorticoid-sensitive genes and decreased expression of inflammatory genes, suggesting a possible hormonal effect. Pollutant exposure increased plasma levels of adrenocorticotropic hormone and the glucocorticoid corticosterone, confirming activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, and there was a corresponding increase in markers of glucocorticoid activity. Although effects were transient and presumably represent an adaptive response to acute exposure in these healthy animals, chronic activation and inappropriate regulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis are associated with adverse neurobehavioral, metabolic, immune, developmental, and cardiovascular effects.

Here, we use forest inventory data to examine the impact of nitrogen deposition on tree growth, survival and carbon storage across the northeastern and north-central USA during the 1980s and 1990s. We show a range of growth and mortality responses to nitrogen deposition among the region's 24 most common tree species. Nitrogen deposition (which ranged from 3 to 11 kg ha(-1) yr(-1)) enhanced the growth of 11 species and decreased the growth of 3 species. Nitrogen deposition enhanced growth of all tree species with arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi associations. In the absence of disturbances that reduced carbon stocks by more than 50%, above-ground biomass increment increased by 61 kg of carbon per kg of nitrogen deposited, amounting to a 40% enhancement over pre-industrial conditions.

Inflammation in the adipose tissues niches are widely believed to exert important effects on organ dysfunction. Recent data from both human and animal models suggest a role for inflammation and oxidative stress in epicardial adipose tissue (EAT) as a risk factor for the development of cardiovascular disease. We hypothesized that inhalational exposure to concentrated ambient fine particulates (CAPs) and ozone (O3) exaggerates inflammation and oxidative stress in EAT and perirenal adipose tissue (PAT).<br /><br /><strong>METHODS: </strong>Eight- week-old Male Sprague--Dawley rats were fed a normal diet (ND) or high fructose diet (HFr) for 8 weeks, and then exposed to ambient AIR, CAPs at a mean of 356 mug/m3, O3 at 0.485 ppm, or CAPs (441 mug/m3) + O3 (0.497 ppm) in Dearborn, MI, 8 hours/day, 5 days/week, for 9 days over 2 weeks.<br /><br /><strong>RESULTS: </strong>EAT and PAT showed whitish color in gross, and less mitochondria, higher mRNA expression of white adipose specific and lower brown adipose specific genes than in brown adipose tissues. Exposure to CAPs and O3 resulted in the increase of macrophage infiltration in both EAT and PAT of HFr groups. Proinflammatory genes of Tnf-alpha, Mcp-1 and leptin were significantly upregulated while IL-10 and adiponectin, known as antiinflammatory genes, were reduced after the exposures. CAPs and O3 exposures also induced an increase in inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) protein expression, and decrease in mitochondrial area in EAT and PAT. We also found significant increases in macrophages of HFr-O3 rats. The synergetic interaction of HFr and dirty air exposure on the inflammation was found in most of the experiments. Surprisingly, exposure to CAPs or O3 induced more significant inflammation and oxidative stress than co-exposure of CAPs and O3 in EAT and PAT.<br /><br /><strong>CONCLUSION: </strong>EAT and PAT are both white adipose tissues. Short-term exposure to CAPs and O3, especially with high fructose diet, induced inflammation and oxidative stress in EAT and PAT in rats. These findings may provide a link between air-pollution exposure and accelerated susceptibility to cardiovascular disease and metabolic complications.",0,0,5.1.2,Biological Plausibility

The drivers of carbon sequestration, the geographical spread and magnitude of this sink are however hotly debated. Photosynthesis determines the total C uptake of terrestrial ecosystems and is a major flux of the global C balance. We contribute to the discussion on enhanced C sequestration by analyzing the influence of nitrogen (N) deposition on photosynthetic capacity (A(max)) of forest canopies. Eddy covariance measurements of net exchange of carbon provide estimates of gross primary production, from which A(max) is derived with a novel approach. Canopy A(max) is combined with modeled N deposition, environmental variables and stand characteristics to study the relative effects on A(max) for a unique global data set of 80 forest FLUXNET sites. Canopy A(max) relates positively to N deposition for evergreen needleleaf forests below an observed critical load of similar to 8 kgN ha(-1) yr(-1), with a slope of 2.0 +/- 0.4 (S.E.) mu mol CO2 m(-2) s(-1) per 1 kgN ha(-1) yr(-1). Above this threshold canopy A(max) levels off, exhibiting a saturating response in line with the N saturation hypothesis. Climate effects on canopy A(max) cannot be separated from the effect of N deposition due to considerable covariation. For deciduous broadleaf forests and forests in the temperate (-continental) climate zones, the analysis shows the N deposition effect to be either small or absent. Leaf area index and foliar N concentration are positively but weakly related to A(max). We conclude that flux tower measurements of C fluxes provide valuable data to study physiological processes at the canopy scale. Future efforts need to be directed toward standardizing measures N cycling and pools within C monitoring networks to gain a better understanding of C and N interactions, and to disentangle the role of climate and N deposition in forest ecosystems.",0,0,8.12.1,Nitrogen

Soybean (Glycine max) is particularly sensitive to O(3); therefore, establishing an O(3) exposure threshold for damage is critical to understanding the current and future impact of this pollutant. This study aims to determine the exposure response of soybean to elevated tropospheric O(3) by measuring the agronomic, biochemical, and physiological responses of seven soybean genotypes to nine O(3) concentrations (38-120 nL L(-1)) within a fully open-air agricultural field location across 2 years. All genotypes responded similarly, with season-long exposure to O(3) causing a linear increase in antioxidant capacity while reducing leaf area, light absorption, specific leaf mass, primary metabolites, seed yield, and harvest index. Across two seasons with different temperature and rainfall patterns, there was a robust linear yield decrease of 37 to 39 kg ha(-1) per nL L(-1) cumulative O(3) exposure over 40 nL L(-1). The existence of immediate effects of O(3) on photosynthesis, stomatal conductance, and photosynthetic transcript abundance before and after the initiation and termination of O(3) fumigation were concurrently assessed, and there was no evidence to support an instantaneous photosynthetic response. The ability of the soybean canopy to intercept radiation, the efficiency of photosynthesis, and the harvest index were all negatively impacted by O(3), suggesting that there are multiple targets for improving soybean responses to this damaging air pollutant.",0,0,8.5.1,Field Studies and Meta Analyses

Leaves are key indicators of productivity and we measured the mass, area, and nitrogen concentration of leaves collected in litter traps from 2002 to 2008 in three young northern temperate forest communities exposed to elevated CO2 and/or elevated O-3 since 1998. On average, the overall effect of elevated CO2 (+CO2 and +CO2+O-3 versus ambient and +O-3) was to increase leaf mass by 36% whereas the overall effect of elevated O-3 was to decrease leaf mass by 13%, with similar effects on stand leaf area. However, there were important CO2 x O-3 x year interactions wherein some treatment effects on leaf mass changed dramatically relative to ambient from 2002 to 2008. For example, stimulation by the +CO2 treatment decreased (from +52 to +25%), whereas the deleterious effects of the +O-3 treatment increased (from -5 to -18%). In comparison, leaf mass in the +CO2+O-3 treatment was similar to ambient throughout the study. Forest composition influenced these responses: effects of the +O-3 treatment on community-level leaf mass ranged from +2 to -19%. These findings are evidence that community composition, stand development processes, CO2, and O-3 strongly interact.

Concentration, deposition, and uptake of O-3 are accessible by observation and modelling, while injury can be assessed visually or through remote sensing. However, the relationship between O-3 metrics and injury is confounded by variation in sensitivity to O-3. Sensitivity weighting parameters have previously been assigned to different plant functional types and growth stages, or by differentially weighting O-3 concentrations, but diel and seasonal variability have not been addressed. Here a plant sensitivity parameter (S) is introduced, relating injury to O-3 dose (uptake) using three independent injury endpoints in the crop species, Pima cotton (Gossypium barbadense). The diel variability of S was determined by assessment at 2h intervals. Pulses of O-3 (15min) were used to assess passive (constitutive) defence mechanisms and dose was used rather than concentration to avoid genetic or environmental effects on stomatal regulation. A clear diel trend in S was apparent, with maximal sensitivity in mid-afternoon, not closely related to gas exchange, whole leaf ascorbate, or total antioxidant capacity. This physiologically based sensitivity parameter provides a novel weighting factor to improve modelled relationships between either flux or exposure to O-3, and O-3 impacts. This represents a substantial improvement over concentration- or phenology-based weighting factors currently in use. Future research will be required to characterize the variability and metabolic drivers of diel changes in S, and the performance of this parameter in prediction of O-3 injury.",0,0,8.2,Visible Foliar Injury and Biomonitoring

Exposure to ozone (O(3)) and allergens during postnatal lung development alters structural elements of conducting airways, including innervation and neurokinin abundance. These changes have been linked with development of asthma in a rhesus monkey model. We hypothesized that O(3) exposure resets the ability of the airways to respond to oxidant stress and that this is mediated by changes in the neurokinin-1 receptor (NK-1R). Infant rhesus monkeys received episodic exposure to O(3) biweekly with or without house dust mite antigen (HDMA) from 6 to 12 months of age. Age-matched monkeys were exposed to filtered air (FA). Microdissected airway explants from midlevel airways (intrapulmonary generations 5-8) for four to six animals in each of four groups (FA, O(3), HDMA, and HDMA+O(3)) were tested for NK-1R gene responses to acute oxidant stress using exposure to hydrogen peroxide (1.2 mM), a lipid ozonide (10 ?M), or sham treatment for 4 hours in vitro. Airway responses were measured using real-time quantitative RT-PCR of NK-1R and IL-8 gene expression. Basal NK-1R gene expression levels were not different between the exposure groups. Treatment with ozonide or hydrogen peroxide did not change NK-1R gene expression in animals exposed to FA, HDMA, or HDMA+O(3). However, treatment in vitro with lipid ozonide significantly increased NK-1R gene expression in explants from O(3)-exposed animals.

Eight hours after exposure, we assessed cardiac responses using a Langendorff preparation in a protocol consisting of 20 min of global ischemia followed by 2 hr of reperfusion. Cardiac function was assessed by measuring the index of left-ventricular developed pressure (LVDP) and contractility (dP/dt) before ischemia. On reperfusion after ischemia, recovery of postischemic LVDP and size of infarct were examined. We used bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) cell counts to assess lung inflammation.Results: Exposure to the multipollutant mixtures decreased LVDP, baseline rate of left ventricular contraction (dP/dtmaximum), and baseline rate of left ventricular relaxation (dP/dtminimum) compared with exposure to FA. Exposure to O3 also decreased heart rate and dP/dtminimum. Time to ischemic contracture was prolonged in the multipollutant-mixture group relative to that in the FA group. Mice in the multipollutant-mixture group had better recovery of postischemic LVDP and smaller infarct size. Exposure to multipollutant mixtures and to O3 exposure increased numbers of macrophages in the BAL fluid.Conclusions: Exposure to photochemically altered urban air pollution appears to affect cardiac mechanics in isolated perfused hearts. Inhalation of acute multipollutant mixtures decreases LVDP and cardiac contractility in isolated non-ischemic murine hearts, prolongs ischemic contracture, increases postischemic recovery of LVDP, and reduces infarct size.Citation: McIntosh-Kastrinsky R, Diaz-Sanchez D, Sexton KG, Jania CM, Zavala J, Tilley SL, Jaspers I, Gilmour MI, Devlin RB, Cascio WE, Tong H. 2013.

It has been reported in >500 publications, 20 times more frequently for the estimation of IR than beta-cell function. 

This article summarizes the physiological basis of HOMA, a structural model of steady-state insulin and glucose domains, constructed from physiological dose responses of glucose uptake and insulin production. Hepatic and peripheral glucose efflux and uptake were modeled to be dependent on plasma glucose and insulin concentrations. Decreases in beta-cell function were modeled by changing the beta-cell response to plasma glucose concentrations. The original HOMA model was described in 1985 with a formula for approximate estimation. The computer model is available but has not been as widely used as the approximation formulae. HOMA has been validated against a variety of physiological methods. 

We review the use and reporting of HOMA in the literature and give guidance on its appropriate use (e.g., cohort and epidemiological studies) and inappropriate use (e.g., measuring beta-cell function in isolation). The HOMA model compares favorably with other models and has the advantage of requiring only a single plasma sample assayed for insulin and glucose. 

In conclusion, the HOMA model has become a widely used clinical and epidemiological tool and, when used appropriately, it can yield valuable data.

There is a need to study whether the adverse effects of traffic-related air pollution (TRAP) on childhood asthma and allergic diseases documented during early-life persist into later childhood. This longitudinal study examined whether TRAP is associated with the prevalence of asthma, allergic rhinitis and aeroallergen sensitization in two German cohorts followed from birth to 10 years. Materials. Questionnaire-derived annual reports of doctor diagnosed asthma and allergic rhinitis, as well as eye and nose symptoms, were collected from 6,604 children. Aeroallergen sensitization was assessed for 3,655 children who provided blood samples. Associations between these health outcomes and nitrogen dioxide (NO2), particles with aerodynamic diameters less than 2.5 ?g/m(3) (PM2.5) mass, PM2.5 absorbance and ozone, individually estimated for each child at the birth, six and 10 year home addresses, were assessed using generalized estimation equations including adjustments for relevant covariates. Odds ratios [95% confidence intervals] per increase in interquartile range of pollutant are presented for the total population and per geographical area (GINI/LISA South, GINI/LISA North and LISA East, Germany). Results. The risk estimates for the total population were generally null across outcomes and pollutants. The area-specific results were heterogeneous. In GINI/LISA North, all associations were null. In LISA East, associations with ozone were elevated for all outcomes, and those for allergic rhinitis and eyes and nose symptom prevalence reached statistical significance (1.30 [1.02, 1.64] and 1.35 [1.16, 1.59], respectively).

When examining the entire population, weather type was shown to have the greatest modifying effect on the risk of dying due to ozone (O3). This effect was highest on average for the dry tropical (DT) weather type, with the all-age RR of mortality at a population weighted mean (PWM) found to be 1.055 (95% CI 1.026-1.085). All-weather type risk estimates increased with age due to exposure to carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), and sulphur dioxide (SO2). On average, RR increased by 2.6, 3.8 and 1.5% for the respective pollutants between the ?64 and ?85 age categories. Conversely, mean ozone estimates remained relatively consistent with age. Elevated levels of air pollution were found to be detrimental to the health of elderly individuals for all weather types. However, the entire population was negatively effected by air pollution on the hot dry (DT) and hot humid (MT) days.<br /><br /><strong>CONCLUSIONS: </strong>We identified a significant modification of RR for mortality due to air pollution by age, which is enhanced under specific weather types.

It is therefore urgent that good, reliable biomarkers are available to quantify the toxicity of this pollutant gas at the population level. Such a biomarker would need to be easily performed, reproducible, economically viable, and reflective of ongoing pathological processes occurring within the lung.
<br>
<br>Methodology: We examined whether blood neutrophilia occurred following a controlled ozone challenge and addressed whether this could serve as a biomarker for ozone-induced airway inflammation. Three separate groups of healthy subjects were exposed to ozone (0.2 ppm, 2h) and filtered air (FA) on two separate occasions. Peripheral blood samples were collected and bronchoscopy with biopsy sampling and lavages was performed at 1.5h post exposures in group 1 (n=13), at 6h in group 2 (n=15) and at 18h in group 3 (n=15). Total and differential cell counts were assessed in blood, bronchial tissue and airway lavages.
<br>
<br>Results: In peripheral blood, we observed fewer neutrophils 1.5h after ozone compared with the parallel air exposure (-1.1 +/- 1.0x10(9) cells/L, p<0.01), at 6h neutrophil numbers were increased compared to FA (+1.2 +/- 1.3x10(9) cells/L, p<0.01), and at 18h this response had fully attenuated. Ozone induced a peak in neutrophil numbers at 6h post exposure in all compartments examined, with a positive correlation between the response in blood and bronchial biopsies.

Serum and tissue biomarkers were analyzed 18 h after final ozone for acute and subchronic studies, and immediately after each day of exposure in the time-course study. Age-related glucose intolerance and increases in metabolic biomarkers were apparent at baseline. Acute ozone caused hyperglycemia and glucose intolerance in rats of all ages. Ozone-induced glucose intolerance was reduced in rats exposed for 13 weeks. Acute, but not subchronic ozone increased alpha(2)-macroglobulin, adiponectin and osteopontin. Time-course analysis indicated glucose intolerance at days 1 and 2 (2N1), and a recovery 18 h post ozone. Leptin increased day 1 and epinephrine at all times after ozone. Ozone tended to decrease phosphorylated insulin receptor substrate-1 in liver and adipose tissues. ER stress appeared to be the consequence of ozone induced acute metabolic impairment since transcriptional markers of ER stress increased only after 2 days of ozone.

Practical violations of this assumption frequently occur in data analysis when certain exposures are rarely observed within some strata of the population. The inverse probability of treatment weighted (IPTW) estimator is particularly sensitive to violations of this assumption; however, we demonstrate that this is a problem for all estimators of causal effects. This is due to the fact that the ETA assumption is about information (or lack thereof) in the data. A new class of causal models, causal models for realistic individualized exposure rules (CMRIER), is based on dynamic interventions. CMRIER generalize MSM, and their parameters remain fully identifiable from the observed data, even when the ETA assumption is violated, if the dynamic interventions are set to be realistic. Examples of such realistic interventions are provided. We argue that causal effects defined by CMRIER may be more appropriate in many situations, particularly those with policy considerations. Through simulation studies, we examine the performance of the IPTW estimator of the CMRIER parameters in contrast to that of the MSM parameters.

After adjusting for confounding factors, an increased prevalence of obesity was associated with an interquartile range increase in PM10 (31 mu g/m(3); odds ratio [ORs] 1.19; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.11-1.26), SO2 (7.4 ppb; ORs 1.11; 95% CI: 1.03-1.20), NO2 (5.3 ppb; ORs 1.13; 95% CI: 1.04-1.22), and O-3 (11.5 ppb; ORs 1.14; 95% CI: 1.04-1.24). Prevalence of overweight increased with an interquartile range increase in O-3 (11.5 ppb; ORs 1.09; 95% CI: 1.03-1.15).

Conclusions: This study suggests that air pollution is positively associated with an increased likelihood of obesity or overweight in children.",0,0,5.2.2,Biological Plausibility

Animal studies demonstrate that altered lung development is associated with modified signaling within the airway epithelial mesenchymal trophic unit, including mediators that can change nerve growth. We hypothesized that ozone exposure alters the normal pattern of serotonin, its transporter (5-HTT), and two key receptors (5-HT2A and 5-HT4), a pathway involved in postnatal airway neural, epithelial, and immune processes. We exposed monkeys to acute or episodic ozone during the first 2 or 6 months of life. There were three exposure groups/age: (1) filtered air, (2) acute ozone challenge, and (3) episodic ozone + acute ozone challenge. Lungs were prepared for compartment-specific qRT-PCR, immunohistochemistry, and stereology. Airway epithelial serotonin immunopositive staining increased in all exposure groups with the most prominent in 2-month midlevel and 6-month distal airways. Gene expression of 5-HTT, 5-HT2AR, and 5-HT4R increased in an age-dependent manner. Overall expression was greater in distal compared with midlevel airways. Ozone exposure disrupted both 5-HT2AR and 5-HT4R protein expression in airways and enhanced immunopositive staining for 5-HT2AR (2 months) and 5-HT4R (6 months) on smooth muscle. Ozone exposure increases serotonin in airway epithelium regardless of airway level, age, and exposure history and changes the spatial pattern of serotonin receptor protein (5-HT2A and 5-HT4) and 5-HTT gene expression depending on compartment, age, and exposure history. Understanding how serotonin modulates components of reversible airway obstruction exacerbated by ozone exposure sets the foundation for developing clinically relevant therapies for airway disease.",0,0,3.2.3,Biological Plausibility

In Sftpd-/- mice, but not wild-type (WT) mice, age-related increases in numbers of enlarged vacuolated macrophages were observed in the lung, along with alveolar wall rupture, type 2 cell hyperplasia, and increased bronchoalveolar lavage protein and cell content. Numbers of heme oxygenase+ macrophages also increased with age in Sftpd-/- mice, together with classically (iNOS+) and alternatively (mannose receptor+, YM-1+, or galectin-3+) activated macrophages. In both WT and Sftpd-/- mice, increasing age from 8 to 27 wk was associated with reduced lung stiffness, as reflected by decreases in resistance and elastance spectra; however, this response was reversed in 80-wk-old Sftpd-/- mice. Ozone exposure (0.8 ppm, 3 h) caused increases in lung pathology, alveolar epithelial barrier dysfunction, and numbers of iNOS+ macrophages in 8- and 27-wk-old Sftpd-/-, but not WT mice at 72 h postexposure. Conversely, increases in alternatively activated macrophages were observed in 8-wk-old WT mice following ozone exposure, but not in Sftpd-/- mice. Ozone also caused alterations in both airway and tissue mechanics in Sftpd-/- mice at 8 and 27 wk, but not at 80 wk.

Methods?Data for this report come primarily from the 2006?2010 National Survey of Family Growth (NSFG), which consisted of 22,682 interviews with men and women aged 15?44, conducted from June 2006 through June 2010. The response rate for women in the 2006?2010 NSFG was 78%, and for men was 75%. Selected trends are shown based on prior NSFG years. 

Results?The percentage of married women aged 15?44 who were infertile fell from 8.5% in 1982 (2.4 million women) to 6.0% (1.5 million) in 2006?2010. Impaired fecundity among married women aged 15?44 increased from 11% in 1982 to 15% in 2002, but decreased to 12% in 2006?2010. Among all women, 11% had impaired fecundity in 2006?2010.

Particulate matter, mainly emitted by diesel vehicles, appears to be the most important stressor. However, the possible influence of benzene from gasoline-fueled cars has not been explored so far.<br /><br /><strong>METHODS AND RESULTS: </strong>We conducted a case-crossover study from 2,134 MI cases recorded by the local Coronary Heart Disease Registry (2000-2007) in the Strasbourg Metropolitan Area (France). Available individual data were age, gender, previous history of ischemic heart disease and address of residence at the time of the event. Nitrogen dioxide, particles of median aerodynamic diameter &lt;10 ?m (PM10), ozone, carbon monoxide and benzene air concentrations were modeled on an hourly basis at the census block level over the study period using the deterministic ADMS-Urban air dispersion model. Model input data were emissions inventories, background pollution measurements, and meteorological data. We have found a positive, statistically significant association between concentrations of benzene and the onset of MI: per cent increase in risk for a 1 ?g/m3 increase in benzene concentration in the previous 0, 0-1 and 1 day was 10.4 (95% confidence interval 3-18.2), 10.7 (2.7-19.2) and 7.2 (0.3-14.5), respectively. The associations between the other pollutants and outcome were much lower and in accordance with the literature.<br /><br /><strong>CONCLUSION: </strong>We have observed that benzene in ambient air is strongly associated with the triggering of MI. This novel finding needs confirmation. If so, this would mean that not only diesel vehicles, the main particulate matter emitters, but also gasoline-fueled cars--main benzene emitters-, should be taken into account for public health action.",0,0,4.3.1,Short Term Ozone Exposure

We examined associations between these exposures and hyperemic response to ischemia and baseline pulse amplitude, a measure of arterial tone (n = 2,369). Higher short-term exposure to air pollutants, including PM2.5, black carbon, and particle number was associated with higher baseline pulse amplitude. For example, higher 3-day average PM2.5 exposure was associated with 6.3% higher baseline pulse amplitude (95% confidence interval: 2.0, 10.9). However, there were no consistent associations between the air pollution exposures assessed and hyperemic response. Our findings in a community-based sample exposed to relatively low pollution levels suggest that short-term exposure to ambient particulate pollution is not associated with vasodilator response, but that particulate air pollution is associated with baseline pulse amplitude, suggesting potentially adverse alterations in baseline vascular tone or compliance.",0,0,4.1.7.2,Epidemiologic Panel Studies

Atmospheric pollutants are an important facet of the abiotic environment and can impinge on a plant's volatile-mediated defences in multiple ways at multiple temporal scales. They can exert changes in volatile emissions through oxidative stress, as is the case with ozone pollution. The pollutants, in particular, ozone, nitrogen oxides and hydroxyl radicals, also react with volatiles in the atmosphere. These reactions result in volatile breakdown products, which may themselves be perceived by community members as informative signals.

Daily emergency department visits were obtained for children aged 3-17 years with a primary diagnosis of asthma during the warm season (April through September), 2004-2007 (inclusive). Bi-directional control sampling was used to select two control periods for each case for a total of 65,562 inclusion days. Since the period of exposure prior to emergency department visit may be the most clinically relevant, lag exposures were investigated (same day (lag0), 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 as well as 3-day and 5-day moving averages). Multivariable conditional logistic regression controlling for holiday, school-in-session indicator, and 3-day moving average for temperature and relative humidity was used to examine the associations.

Tropospheric O-3 is elevated in many urban and some rural areas in the United States and globally. We previously showed that controlled O-3 exposure at near-ambient concentrations (up to 114 nL L-1, 12-h mean) did not increase foliar ClO4-. Under laboratory conditions, O-3 has been shown to oxidize Cl-to ClO4-. Plant tissues contain Cl- and exhibit responses to O-3 invoking redox reactions. As higher levels of O-3 are associated with stratospheric incursion and with developing megacities, we have hypothesized that exposure of vegetation to such elevated O-3 may increase foliar ClO4-. This would contribute to ClO4- in environments without obvious point sources. At these high O-3 concentrations (up to 204 nL L-1, 12-h mean; 320 nL L-1 maximum), we demonstrated an increase in the ClO4- concentration in surface soil that was linearly related to the O-3 concentration. There was no relationship of foliar ClO4- with O-3 exposure or dose (stomatal uptake). Accumulation of ClO4- varied among species at low O-3, but this was not related to soil surface ClO4- or to foliar ClO4- concentrations following exposure to O-3.

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are epigenetic regulators of genomic response to environmental insults and unstudied in relationship to O-3 inhalation exposure. Our objective was to test whether O-3 inhalation exposure significantly alters miRNA expression profiles within the human bronchial airways. Twenty healthy adult human volunteers were exposed to 0.4 ppm O-3 for 2 h. Induced sputum samples were collected from each subject 48 h preexposure and 6 h postexposure for evaluation of miRNA expression and markers of inflammation in the airways. Genomewide miRNA expression profiles were evaluated by microarray analysis, and in silico predicted mRNA targets of the O-3-responsive miRNAs were identified and validated against previously measured O-3-induced changes in mRNA targets. Biological network analysis was performed on the O-3-associated miRNAs and mRNA targets to reveal potential associated response signaling and functional enrichment. Expression analysis of the sputum samples revealed that O-3 exposure significantly increased the expression levels of 10 miRNAs, namely miR-132, miR-143, miR-145, miR-199a*, miR-199b-5p, miR-222, miR-223, miR-25, miR-424, and miR-582-5p. The miRNAs and their predicted targets were associated with a diverse range of biological functions and disease signatures, noted among them inflammation and immune-related disease.

In contrast, comparisons of modelled feedback processes with observations indicate that the most realistic models have higher sensitivities(5,6). Here I analyse results from recent climate modelling intercomparison projects to demonstrate that transient climate sensitivity to historical aerosols and ozone is substantially greater than the transient climate sensitivity to CO2. This enhanced sensitivity is primarily caused by more of the forcing being located at Northern Hemisphere middle to high latitudes where it triggers more rapid land responses and stronger feedbacks.

By using the Dynamic Land Ecosystem Model (DLEM) in combination with spatially explicit, longterm historical data series on multiple environmental factors, we examined the century-scale responses of ecosystem C storage and flux to multiple environmental changes in the SUS. The results indicated that multiple environmental changes shifted SUS ecosystems from a C source of 1.20 +/- A 0.56 Pg (1 Pg = 10(15) g) during the period 1895 to 1950, to a C sink of 2.00 +/- A 0.94 Pg during the period 1951 to 2007. Over the entire period spanning 1895-2007, SUS ecosystems were a net C sink of 0.80 +/- A 0.38 Pg. The C sink was primarily due to an increase in the vegetation C pool, whereas the soil C pool decreased during the study period. The spatiotemporal changes of C storage were caused by changes in multiple environmental factors. Among the five factors examined (climate, LULCC, N deposition, atmospheric CO2, and tropospheric O-3), elevated atmospheric CO2 concentration was the largest contributor to C sequestration, followed by N deposition.

Trembling aspen (Populus tremuloides) and paper birch (Betula papyrifera) were grown at the Aspen FACE research site in northern Wisconsin, USA, under all combinations of ambient and elevated CO2 and O-3. We measured the effects of elevated CO2 and O-3 on aspen and birch phytochemistry and on the survivorship, development time, growth, and fecundity of the gypsy moth (Lymantria dispar). Elevated CO2 had little effect on, whereas elevated O-3 altered, the composite phytochemical profiles of aspen and birch. Nutritional quality in aspen and birch leaves was marginally affected by elevated CO2 and reduced by elevated O-3. Both gases increased concentrations of phenolic and structural compounds in aspen and birch. Elevated CO2 offset reduced foliar quality under elevated O-3, but only in aspen, and to a greater extent later than earlier in spring. Elevated CO2 generally had beneficial effects on, while elevated O-3 detrimentally affected, gypsy moth performance. Elevated CO2 ameliorated most of the reductions in gypsy moth performance under elevated O-3. Our findings suggest that atmospheric change can alter foliar quality in gypsy moth hosts sufficiently to influence gypsy moth performance, but that these responses will depend on interactions among CO2, O-3, and tree species. Our findings also contrast with those of earlier studies at Aspen FACE, indicating that foliar quality responses to environmental change are likely influenced by tree stand age and longevity of exposure to pollutants to the extent that they affect plant-herbivore interactions differently over decadal time spans.",0,0,8.6.1,Individual Level Responses

We experimentally tested the hypothesis that elevated O-3 tends to reduce the nutrition of tomato plants, and to increase the SA-dependent pathway defenses and the secondary metabolites, and therefore decrease the population fitness of the whitefly. The results show that for all three tomato genotypes, elevated O-3 reduced the soluble sugars and free amino acids, increased the phenylalanine ammonia-lyase enzyme activity and the accumulated salicylic acid (SA), and up-regulated the pathogenesis-related protein (PR1), which is commonly considered to be the whitefly-resistance gene product involved in SA-dependent defense. Elevated O-3 did not affect the JA level in any of the three plant genotypes, but it increased the levels of some secondary metabolites, including total phenolics and condensed tannins. Elevated O-3 prolonged the developmental time of whiteflies fed on the three plant genotypes, and it also reduced the fecundity and the intrinsic rate of increase of whiteflies fed on either the 35S or the wild-type plants.

I suggest separating three test conditions: uncoupled systems (plants not depending in a natural nutrient cycle) (I); expanding systems, in which plants are given ample space and time to explore otherwise limited resources (II); and fully coupled systems in which the natural nutrient cycling governs growth at steady-state leaf area index (LAI) and fine root renewal (III).

Here, we report results from an extensive sampling of plant biomass and soil conducted at the conclusion of the experiment that enabled us to estimate ecosystem carbon (C) content and cumulative net primary productivity (NPP). Elevated CO2 enhanced ecosystem C content by 11%, whereas elevated O-3 decreased ecosystem C content by 9%. There was little variation in treatment effects on C content across communities and no meaningful interactions between CO2 and O-3. Treatment effects on ecosystem C content resulted primarily from changes in the near-surface mineral soil and tree C, particularly differences in woody tissues. Excluding the mineral soil, cumulative NPP was a strong predictor of ecosystem C content (r(2) = 0.96). Elevated CO2 enhanced cumulative NPP by 39%, a consequence of a 28% increase in canopy nitrogen (N) content (g N m(-2)) and a 28% increase in N productivity (NPP/canopy N). In contrast, elevated O-3 lowered NPP by 10% because of a 21% decrease in canopy N, but did not impact N productivity. Consequently, as the marginal impact of canopy N on NPP (Delta NPP/Delta N) decreased through time with further canopy development, the O-3 effect on NPP dissipated. Within the mineral soil, there was less C in the top 0.1 m of soil under elevated O-3 and less soil C from 0.1 to 0.2 m in depth under elevated CO2. Overall, these results suggest that elevated CO2 may create a sustained increase in NPP, whereas the long-term effect of elevated O-3 on NPP will be smaller than expected.

In this synthesis, net primary productivity (NPP), net ecosystem productivity (NEP), and five pools of C (living biomass, coarse woody debris, organic soil horizons, soil, and total ecosystem) are summarized by age class for tropical, temperate, and boreal forest biomes. Estimates of variability in NPP, NEP, and C pools are provided for each biome-age class combination and the sources of variability are discussed. Aggregated biome-level estimates of NPP and NEP were higher in intermediate-aged forests (e.g., 30-120 years), while older forests (e.g., &gt;120 years) were generally less productive. The mean NEP in the youngest forests (0-10 years) was negative (source to the atmosphere) in both boreal and temperate biomes (-0.1 and -1.9 Mg C ha(-1) yr(-1), respectively). Forest age is a highly significant source of variability in NEP at the biome scale; for example, mean temperate forest NEP was -1.9, 4.5, 2.4, 1.9 and 1.7 Mg C ha(-1) yr(-1) across five age classes (0-10, 11-30, 31-70, 71-120, 121-200 years, respectively).

Using the information gained from calculating the summary statistics for NPP and NEP, we calculated heterotrophic soil respiration (R(h)) for each age class in each biome. The mean R(h) was high in the youngest temperate age class (9.7 Mg C ha(-1) yr(-1)) and declined with age, implying that forest ecosystem respiration peaks when forests are young, not old. With notable exceptions, carbon pool sizes increased with age in all biomes, including soil C.

We analyzed long-term continuous measurements (&gt;9 site-years at 30min resolution) of environmental and eco-physiological parameters at three Mediterranean ecosystems: (i) forest site dominated by Pinus ponderosa in the Sierra Mountains in California, USA; (ii) forest site composed of a mixture of Quercus spp. and P. pinea in the Tyrrhenian sea coast near Rome, Italy; and (iii) orchard site of Citrus sinensis cultivated in the California Central Valley, USA. We hypothesized that higher levels of ozone concentration in the atmosphere result in a decrease in carbon assimilation by trees under field conditions. This hypothesis was tested using time series analysis such as wavelet coherence and spectral Granger causality, and complemented with multivariate linear and nonlinear statistical analyses. We found that reduction in carbon assimilation was more related to stomatal ozone deposition than to ozone concentration. The negative effects of ozone occurred within a day of exposure/uptake. Decoupling between carbon assimilation and stomatal aperture increased with the amount of ozone pollution. Up to 12-19% of the carbon assimilation reduction in P. ponderosa and in the Citrus plantation was explained by higher stomatal ozone deposition. In contrast, the Italian site did not show reductions in gross primary productivity either by ozone concentration or stomatal ozone deposition, mainly due to the lower ozone concentrations in the periurban site over the shorter period of investigation.

Above- and below-ground biomass accumulation, stem growth and soil respiration were measured in 2008. In addition, a C-13-labelling experiment was conducted with gt15 trees. After the second exposure season, elevated temperature increased silver birch above- and below-ground growth and soil respiration rates. However, some of these variables showed that the temperature effect was modified by tree genotype and prevailing O-3 level. For instance, in gt14 soil respiration was increased in elevated temperature alone (T) and in elevated O-3 and elevated temperature in combination (O-3 + T) treatments, but in other genotypes O-3 either partly (gt12) or totally nullified (gt25) temperature effects on soil respiration, or acted synergistically with temperature (gt15). Before leaf abscission, all genotypes had the largest leaf biomass in T and O-3 + T treatments, whereas at the end of the season temperature effects on leaf biomass depended on the prevailing O-3 level. Temperature increase thus delayed and O-3 accelerated leaf senescence, and in combination treatment O-3 reduced the temperature effect. Photosynthetic : non-photosynthetic tissue ratios (P : nP ratios) showed that elevated temperature increased foliage biomass relative to woody mass, particularly in gt14 and gt12, whereas O-3 and O-3 + T decreased it most clearly in gt25. O-3-caused stem growth reductions were clearest in the fastest-growing gt14 and gt25, whereas mycorrhizal root growth and sporocarp production increased under O-3 in all genotypes. A labelling experiment showed that temperature increased tree total biomass and hence C-13 fixation in the foliage and roots and also label return was highest under elevated temperature. Ozone seemed to change tree C-13 allocation, as it decreased foliar C-13 excess amount, simultaneously increasing C-13 excess obtained from the soil. The present results suggest that warming has potential to increase silver birch growth and hence carbon (C) accumulation in tree biomass, but the final magnitude of this C sink strength is partly counteracted by temperature-induced increase in soil respiration rates and simultaneous O-3 stress.

To test these hypotheses, we analyzed 96 soil samples from a soybean free-air CO2 enrichment (SoyFACE) experimental site using a comprehensive functional gene microarray (GeoChip 3.0). The results showed the overall functional composition and structure of soil microbial communities shifted under eCO(2), eO(3) or eCO(2)+eO(3). Key functional genes involved in carbon fixation and degradation, nitrogen fixation, denitrification and methane metabolism were stimulated under eCO(2), whereas those involved in N fixation, denitrification and N mineralization were suppressed under eO(3), resulting in the fact that the abundance of some eO(3)-supressed genes was promoted to ambient, or eCO(2)-induced levels by the interaction of eCO(2)+eO(3)ch effects appeared distinct for each treatment and significantly correlated with soil properties and soybean yield.

Measurements related to ozone injury included visible chlorotic mottling, needle retention, needle length, and crown depth, which together compose the Ozone Injury Index (OII). The OII values observed in Catalonia were similar to those in California, but OII alone correlated poorly to ambient ozone in all sites. Combining ambient ozone with GIS variables related to landscape variability of plant hydrological status, derived from stepwise regressions, produced models with R-2 = 0.35, p = 0.016 in Catalonia, R-2 = 0.36, p &lt; 0.001 in Yosemite and R-2 = 0.33, p = 0.007 in Sequoia/Kings Canyon National Parks in California. Individual OII components in Catalonia were modeled with improved success compared to the original full OII, in particular visible chlorotic mottling (R-2 = 0.60, p &lt; 0.001). The results show that ozone is negatively impacting forest health in California and Catalonia and also that modeling ozone injury improves by including GIS variables related to plant water relations.

Hyphal respiration did not respond significantly to elevated CO2 and O-3. Sporocarp respiration was affected by temperature and moisture content while hyphal respiratory response to temperature was undetected over the narrower range of soil temperatures captured. Hyphal respiration comprised 31 % of soil respiration, and the ratio of hyphal respiration to soil respiration declined with elevated CO2. Hyphal biomass was reduced under all treatments though not statistically significant.

Oxidative injury due to ozone inhalation causes the generation of reactive oxygen species and can be genotoxic. To determine whether ozone exposure causes genetic damage in peripheral blood lymphocytes, we used a well-validated cytokinesis-block micronucleus Cytome assay. Frequencies of micronuclei (MN) and nucleoplasmic bridges (NB) were used as indicators of cytogenetic damage. Samples were obtained from 22 non-smoking healthy subjects immediately before and 24-hr after controlled 4-hr exposures to filtered air, 100 ppb, and 200 ppb ozone while exercising in a repeated-measure study design. Inhalation of ozone at different exposure levels was associated with a significant dose-dependent increase in MN frequency (P?&lt;?0.0001) and in the number of cells with more than one MN per cell (P?&lt;?0.0005). Inhalation of ozone also caused an increase in the number of apoptotic cells (P?=?0.002). Airway neutrophilia was associated with an increase in MN frequency (P?=?0.033) independent of the direct effects of ozone exposure (P?&lt;?0.0001). We also observed significant increases in both MN and NB frequencies after exercise in filtered air, suggesting that physical activity is also an important inducer of oxidative stress. These results corroborate our previous findings that cytogenetic damage is associated with ozone exposure, and show that damage is dose-dependent. Further study of ozone-induced cytogenetic damage in airway epithelial cells could provide evidence for the role of oxidative injury in lung carcinogenesis, and help to address the potential public health implications of exposures to oxidant environments.

Due to the complexity of ambient air pollution composition, recent studies have examined the effects of co-exposure, particularly particulate matter (PM) and gas, to determine whether pollutant interactions alter (e.g. synergistically, antagonistically) the health response. This study examines the independent effects of fine (FCAPs) and ultrafine (UFCAPs) concentrated ambient particles on cardiac function, and determine the impact of ozone (O3) co-exposure on the response. We hypothesized that UFCAPs would cause greater decrement in mechanical function and electrical dysfunction than FCAPs, and that O3 co-exposure would enhance the effects of both particle-types.MethodsConscious/unrestrained radiotelemetered mice were exposed once whole-body to either 190 ?g/m3 FCAPs or 140 ?g/m3 UFCAPs with/without 0.3 ppm O3; separate groups were exposed to either filtered air (FA) or O3 alone. Heart rate (HR) and electrocardiogram (ECG) were recorded continuously before, during and after exposure, and cardiac mechanical function was assessed using a Langendorff perfusion preparation 24 hrs post-exposure.ResultsFCAPs alone caused a significant decrease in baseline left ventricular developed pressure (LVDP) and contractility, whereas UFCAPs did not; neither FCAPs nor UFCAPs alone caused any ECG changes. O3 co-exposure with FCAPs caused a significant decrease in heart rate variability when compared to FA but also blocked the decrement in cardiac function. On the other hand, O3 co-exposure with UFCAPs significantly increased QRS-interval, QTc and non-conducted P-wave arrhythmias, and decreased LVDP, rate of contractility and relaxation when compared to controls.ConclusionsThese data suggest that particle size and gaseous interactions may play a role in cardiac function decrements one day after exposure. Although FCAPs?+?O3 only altered autonomic balance, UFCAPs?+?O3 appeared to be more serious by increasing cardiac arrhythmias and causing mechanical decrements. As such, O3 appears to interact differently with FCAPs and UFCAPs, resulting in varied cardiac changes, which suggests that the cardiovascular effects of particle-gas co-exposures are not simply additive or even generalizable. Additionally, the mode of toxicity underlying this effect may be subtle given none of the exposures described here impaired post-ischemia recovery.",0,0,3.1.4.4.2,Animal Toxicological Studies

We used the database developed for the National Morbidity and Mortality Air Pollution Study to estimate ozone mortality risks in 97 US cities in May through September, 1987-2000. We treated temperature as a confounder as well as an effect modifier by estimating risks at low, moderate, and high temperature categories. When temperature was treated as a confounder, a 10-ppb increase in daily 24-h ozone was associated with a 0.47% (95% CI: 0.19%-0.76%) increase in mortality. When we assessed effect modification by temperature, the interaction between ozone and temperature was not statistically significant. However, there was a U-shaped pattern in mortality risk, which was greater at the low (&lt;25th percentile) and high (&gt;75th percentile) temperature levels than moderate temperature levels. At the high temperature category, a 10% increase in AC prevalence mitigated mortality risk associated with 10-ppb of ozone exposure by -0.18% (95% CI: -0.35%, -0.02%). Furthermore, ozone mortality risk in the high temperature category increased as we restricted our analyses to hotter days. On days where temperatures exceeded the 75th, 90th, and 95th percentile temperatures, a 10-ppb increase in ozone was associated with a 0.65% (95% CI: 0.20%-1.09%), 0.83% (95% CI: 0.17%-1.48%), and 1.35% (95% CI: 0.44%-2.27%) increase in mortality, respectively. These results suggested that high temperatures may exacerbate physiological responses to short-term ozone exposure.",0,0,6.1.3,Total (Nonaccidental) Mortality

We thus examined ozone effects on steady-state leaf gas exchange and stomatal dynamics in three common tree species of China (Ailanthus altissima, Fraxinus chinensis and Platanus orientalis). Seedlings were grown and were exposed to three levels of ozone in open-top chambers (42, 69, 100 nmol mol(-1) daylight average, from 09:00 to 18:00). At steady-state, ozone exposure induced an uncoupling of photosynthesis and stomatal conductance, as the former decreased while the latter did not. Dynamic stomatal response was investigated by cutting the leaf petiole after a steady-state stomatal conductance was reached. Ozone exposure increased stomatal sluggishness, i.e., slowed stomatal response after leaf cutting, in the following order of sensitivity, F. chinensis&gt;A. altissima&gt;P. orientalis. A restriction of stomatal ozone flux reduced the ozone-induced sluggishness in P. orientalis. The ozone-induced impairment of stomatal control was better explained by stomatal ozone flux per net photosynthesis rather than by stomatal ozone flux only. This suggests that ozone injury to stomatal control depends both on the amount of ozone entering a leaf and on the capacity for biochemical detoxification or repair.

This stress factor alters plant growth and development. Ozone could act as a selection pressure on species communities composition, but also on population genetic background, thus affecting life history traits. Our objective was to evaluate the consequences of prolonged ozone exposure of a weed community on phenotypic traits of Spergulaarvensis linked to persistence. Specifically, we predicted that the selection pressure exerted by high ozone concentrations as well as the concomitant changes in the weed community would drive population adaptive changes which will be reflected on seed germination, dormancy and longevity. In order to test seed viability and dormancy level, we conducted germination experiments for which we used seeds produced by S. arvensis plants grown within a weed community exposed to three ozone treatments during four years (0, 90 and 120 ppb). We also performed a soil seed bank experiment to test seed longevity with seeds coming from both the four-year ozone exposure experiment and from a short-term treatment conducted at ambient and added ozone concentrations. We found that prolonged ozone exposure produced changes in seed germination, dormancy and longevity, resulting in three S. arvensis populations. Seeds from the 90 ppb ozone selection treatment had the highest level of germination when stored at 75% RH and 25 ?C and then scarified. These seeds showed the lowest dormancy level when being subjected to 5 ?C/5% RH and 25 ?C/75% followed by 5% RH storage conditions. Furthermore, ozone exposure increased seed persistence in the soil through a maternal effect. Given that tropospheric ozone is an important pollutant in rural areas, changes in seed traits due to ozone exposure could increase weed persistence in fields, thus affecting weed-crop interactions, which could ultimately reduce crop production.",0,0,8.4.1,Plant Reproduction

A number of emerging techniques, specifically remote sensing methods, have been identified as promising tools for plant phenotyping. These remote sensing methods can be used to accurately and rapidly relate variations in leaf optical properties with important plant characteristics, such as chemistry, morphology, and photosynthetic properties at the leaf and canopy scales. In this study, we explored the potential to utilize optical (? = 500-2,400 nm) near-surface remote sensing reflectance spectroscopy to evaluate the effects of ozone pollution on photosynthetic capacity of soybean (Glycine max Merr.). The research was conducted at the Soybean Free Air Concentration Enrichment (SoyFACE) facility where we subjected plants to ambient (44 nL L(-1)) and elevated ozone (79-82 nL L(-1) target) concentrations throughout the growing season. Exposure to elevated ozone resulted in a significant loss of productivity, with the ozone-treated plants displaying a ~30 % average decrease in seed yield. From leaf reflectance data, it was also clear that elevated ozone decreased leaf nitrogen and chlorophyll content as well as the photochemical reflectance index (PRI), an optical indicator of the epoxidation state of xanthophyll cycle pigments and thus physiological status. We assessed the potential to use leaf reflectance properties and partial least-squares regression (PLSR) modeling as an alternative, rapid approach to standard gas exchange for the estimation of the maximum rates of RuBP carboxylation (V c,max), an important parameter describing plant photosynthetic capacity. While we did not find a significant impact of ozone fumigation on V c,max, standardized to a reference temperature of 25 ?C, the PLSR approach provided accurate and precise estimates of V c,max across ambient plots and ozone treatments (r (2) = 0.88 and RMSE = 13.4 ?mol m(-2) s(-1)) based only on the variation in leaf optical properties and despite significant variability in leaf nutritional status.

Ozone reduced the contents of chlorophyll, increased the accumulation of H2O2 and malondialdehyde in both wheat and flixweed. The effects of competition on chlorophyll content of wheat emerged at elevated and high [O3], while that of flixweed emerged only at high [O3]. The increase of H2O2 and malondialdehyde of flixweed was less than that of wheat under the same condition. Antioxidant enzyme activities of wheat and flixweed were seriously depressed by perennial and serious treatment using O3. However, short-term and moderate fumigation increased the activities of SOD and POD of wheat, and CAT of flixweed.

Here, we report how elevated CO2 and O3 affect the genetic composition of a woody plant population via altered survival. Using data from the Aspen free-air CO2 enrichment (FACE) experiment (in which aspen clones were grown in factorial combinations of CO2 and O3), we develop a hierarchical Bayesian model of survival. We also examine how survival differences between clones could affect pollutant responses in the next generation. Our model predicts that the relative abundance of the tested clones, given equal initial abundance, would shift under either elevated CO2 or O3 as a result of changing survival rates. Survival was strongly affected by between-clone differences in growth responses. Selection could noticeably decrease O3 sensitivity in the next generation, depending on the heritability of growth responses and the distribution of seed production.

In clean air, high VPD reduced biomass and yield by similar fractions in both genotypes compared with low VPD. Data suggest that a stomatal response to VPD per se may be lacking in both genotypes and it is hypothesized that the high VPD resulted in unsustainable transpiration and water deficits that resulted in reduced growth and yield. High VPD- and water-stress-induced stomatal responses may have reduced the O(3) flux into the leaves, which contributed to a higher yield compared to the low VPD treatment in both genotypes.

The ecosystem-scale model version reproduces interannual variability and seasonality of GPP at most sites, especially in croplands. Inclusion of the O-3 damage impact decreases biases of simulated GPP at most of the NACP sites. The simulation with the O-3 damage effect reproduces 64% of the observed variance in summer GPP and 42% on the annual average. Based on a regional gridded simulation over the US, summertime average O-3-free GPP is 6.1 g C m(-2) day(-1) (9.5 g C m(-2) day(-1) in the east of 95 degrees W and 3.9 g C m(-2) day(-1) in the west). O-3 damage decreases GPP by 4-8% on average in the eastern US and leads to significant decreases of 11-17% in east coast hot spots. Sensitivity simulations show that a 25% decrease in surface O-3 concentration halves the average GPP damage to only 2-4 %, suggesting the substantial co-benefits to ecosystem health that may be achieved via O-3 air pollution control.",0,0,8.8.1,Terrestrial Primary Productivity

Current O3 concentrations ([O3]) decrease forest productivity and crop yields and future [O3] will likely increase if current emission rates continue. However, the specific effects of elevated [O3] on reproductive development, a critical stage in the plant's lifecycle, have not been quantitatively reviewed. Data from 128 peer-reviewed articles published from 1968 to 2010 describing the effects of O3 on reproductive growth and development were analysed using meta-analytic techniques. Studies were categorized based on experimental conditions, photosynthetic type, lifecycle, growth habit and flowering class. Current ambient [O3] significantly decreased seed number (-16%), fruit number (-9%) and fruit weight (-22%) compared to charcoal-filtered air. In addition, pollen germination and tube growth were decreased by elevated [O3] compared to charcoal-filtered air. Relative to ambient air, fumigation with [O3] between 70 and 100 ppb decreased yield by 27% and individual seed weight by 18%. Reproductive development of both C3 and C4 plants was sensitive to elevated [O3], and lifecycle, flowering class and reproductive growth habit did not significantly affect a plant's response to elevated [O3] for many components of reproductive development. However, elevated [O3] decreased fruit weight and fruit number significantly in indeterminate plants, and had no effect on these parameters in determinate plants. While gaps in knowledge remain about the effects of O3 on plants with different growth habits, reproductive strategies and photosynthetic types, the evidence strongly suggests that detrimental effects of O3 on reproductive growth and development are compromising current crop yields and the fitness of native plant species.",0,0,8.4,"Plant Reproduction, Phenology, and Mortality"

To investigate ozone-induced oxidative stress as a model for investigating the neurobiology and treatment of certain central nervous system disorders, an experimental ozone inhalation model was developed to administer ozone to intact test animals following acute or chronic exposure. The model was successfully utilized to investigate the effect of dose and duration of exposure to ozone and its resultant effect on oxidative stress markers, depressive-like behaviours and response to antidepressant treatment.

Despite the potential broad ecological significance of reduced plant signaling effectiveness, few studies have examined behavioral responses of insects to their hosts in polluted environments. Here, we use a laboratory study to test the effect of ozone concentration gradients on the ability of the striped cucumber beetle (Acalymma vittatum) to locate flowers of its host plant, Cucurbita foetidissima. Y-tube experiments showed that ozone mixing ratios below 80 parts per billion (ppb) resulted in beetles moving toward their host plant, but levels above 80 ppb resulted in beetles moving randomly with respect to host location.

In this study we used a forest landscape model (LANDIS-II) to scale these site level results to broader temporal and spatial scales. These general principles emerged from the results. (1) The productivity of taxa under future conditions is the primary determinant of short-term taxon dominance. (2) Longer-term, longevity and shade tolerance may supersede productivity as the determinant of importance, depending on the disturbance regime. This result offers hope that, even in the face of atmospheric changes, managers may have some control over future forest composition and carbon sequestration through modification of disturbance regimes. (3) Changes in the abundance of taxa were mostly gradual and none of the taxa were extirpated from the landscape, even under treatments for which they were poorly adapted. This suggests that as atmospheric conditions change, abrupt extirpations are expected to be rare. (4) Similarly, different taxa fared relatively well under different treatments. This suggests that maintaining species and genetic diversity is a prudent forest management strategy in the face of global change.

In the absence of NQO1 as can occur by genetic mutation, the human airway is protected from harmful effects of ozone. We recently reported that NQO1-null mice are protected from airway hyperresponsiveness and pulmonary inflammation following ozone exposure. However, NQO1 regenerates intracellular antioxidants and therefore should protect the individual from oxidative stress. To explain this paradox, we tested whether in the absence of NQO1 ozone exposure results in increased generation of A(2)-isoprostane, a cyclopentenone isoprostane that blunts inflammation. Using GC-MS, we found that NQO1-null mice had greater lung tissue levels of D-2- and E-2-isoprostanes, the precursors of J(2)- and A(2)-isoprostanes, both at base line and following ozone exposure compared with congenic wild-type mice. We confirmed in primary cultures of normal human bronchial epithelial cells that A(2)-isoprostane inhibited ozone-induced NF-kappa B activation and IL-8 regulation. Furthermore, we determined that A(2)-isoprostane covalently modified the active Cys(179) domain in inhibitory kappa B kinase in the presence of ozone in vitro, thus establishing the biochemical basis for A(2)-isoprostane inhibition of NF-kappa B. Our results demonstrate that host factors may regulate pulmonary susceptibility to ozone by regulating the generation of A(2)-isoprostanes in the lung.

Much research has focused on the effect of short-term ozone exposures on mortality and morbidity while controlling for temperature as a confounder, but less is known about the joint effects of ozone and temperature. The extent of the health effects of changing ozone levels and temperatures will depend on whether these effects are additive or synergistic. In this paper we propose a spatial, semi-parametric model to estimate the joint ozone-temperature risk surfaces in 95 US urban areas. Our methodology restricts the ozone-temperature risk surfaces to be monotone in ozone and allows for both nonadditive and nonlinear effects of ozone and temperature. We use data from the National Mortality and Morbidity Air Pollution Study (NMMAPS) and show that the proposed model fits the data better than additive linear and nonlinear models.

We assessed whether long-term reductions in pollution were associated with improvements in respiratory health among children. Methods As part of the Children's Health Study, we measured lung function annually in 2120 children from three separate cohorts corresponding to three separate calendar periods: 1994-1998, 1997-2001, and 2007-2011. Mean ages of the children within each cohort were 11 years at the beginning of the period and 15 years at the end. Linear-regression models were used to examine the relationship between declining pollution levels over time and lung-function development from 11 to 15 years of age, measured as the increases in forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) and forced vital capacity (FVC) during that period (referred to as 4-year growth in FEV1 and FVC). Results Over the 13 years spanned by the three cohorts, improvements in 4-year growth of both FEV1 and FVC were associated with declining levels of nitrogen dioxide (P<0.001 for FEV1 and FVC) and of particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter of less than 2.5 ?m (P= 0.008 for FEV1 and P<0.001 for FVC) and less than 10 ?m (P<0.001 for FEV1 and FVC). These associations persisted after adjustment for several potential confounders. Significant improvements in lung-function development were observed in both boys and girls and in children with asthma and children without asthma. The proportions of children with clinically low FEV1 (defined as <80% of the predicted value) at 15 years of age declined significantly, from 7.9% to 6.3% to 3.6% across the three periods, as the air quality improved (P=0.001).

We enrolled ten healthy subjects exposed in an intermittent exercise protocol to ozone concentrations of 240 ppb and 40 ppb (sham exposure). EBC-pH and FeNO were assessed before (pre), immediately post (post), and 16 h after exposure (16 h). Findings are that compared to baseline, EBC-pH was significantly higher immediately after sham and ozone exposures, but not 16 h later. There was a negative net change in EBC-pH after adjusting for effects after sham exposure (net-?pHpost -0.38 %, net-?pH16h -0.23 %). Concerning FeNO, we observed no changes of values after sham exposure compared to baseline, but measured a significant lower net response at the end of exposure (net-?FeNOpost -17.5 %) which was transient within 16 h (net-?FeNO16h -9.4 %). We conclude that exercise known to enhance EBC-pH may compensate for EBC acidification associated with inflammation resulting in diminished change of this biomarker.

Recently, we showed that ozone (O3) induces glucose intolerance, and increases serum leptin and epinephrine in Brown Norway rats. In this study, we hypothesized that O3 exposure will cause systemic changes in metabolic homeostasis and that serum metabolomic and liver transcriptomic profiling will provide mechanistic insights. In the first experiment, male Wistar Kyoto (WKY) rats were exposed to filtered air (FA) or O3 at 0.25, 0.50, or 1.0ppm, 6h/day for two days to establish concentration-related effects on glucose tolerance and lung injury. In a second experiment, rats were exposed to FA or 1.0ppm O3, 6h/day for either one or two consecutive days, and systemic metabolic responses were determined immediately after or 18h post-exposure. O3 increased serum glucose and leptin on day 1. Glucose intolerance persisted through two days of exposure but reversed 18h-post second exposure. O3 increased circulating metabolites of glycolysis, long-chain free fatty acids, branched-chain amino acids and cholesterol, while 1,5-anhydroglucitol, bile acids and metabolites of TCA cycle were decreased, indicating impaired glycemic control, proteolysis and lipolysis. Liver gene expression increased for markers of glycolysis, TCA cycle and gluconeogenesis, and decreased for markers of steroid and fat biosynthesis. Genes involved in apoptosis and mitochondrial function were also impacted by O3. In conclusion, short-term O3 exposure induces global metabolic derangement involving glucose, lipid, and amino acid metabolism, typical of a stress-response.

This study examined the coronary vascular bed of rats in terms of constrictive and dilatory responses to known agonists following a single O3 inhalation exposure. In addition, serum from exposed rats was used in ex vivo preparations to examine whether bioactivity and toxic effects of inhaled O3 could be conveyed to extrapulmonary systems via the circulation. We found that 24?h following inhalation of 1?ppm O3, isolated coronary vessels exhibited greater basal tone and constricted to a greater degree to serotonin stimulation. Vasodilation to acetylcholine (ACh) was markedly diminished in coronary arteries from O3-exposed rats, compared with filtered air-exposed controls. Dilation to ACh was restored by combined superoxide dismutase and catalase treatment, and also by NADPH oxidase inhibition. When dilute (10%) serum from exposed rats was perfused into the lumen of coronary arteries from unexposed, naive rats, the O3-induced reduction in vasodilatory response to ACh was partially recapitulated. Furthermore, following O3 inhalation, serum exhibited a nitric oxide scavenging capacity, which may partially explain blunted ACh-mediated vasodilatory responses. Thus, bioactivity from inhalation exposures may be due to compositional changes of the circulation. These studies shed light on possible mechanisms of action that may explain O3-associated cardiac morbidity and mortality in humans.",0,0,3.1.4.4.2,Animal Toxicological Studies

Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) and lung tissue were collected 24-72 h after exposure (3 h) of WT and Gal-3(-/-) mice to air or 0.8 ppm ozone. In WT mice, ozone inhalation resulted in increased numbers of proinflammatory (Gal-3(+), iNOS(+)) and anti-inflammatory (MR-1(+)) macrophages in the lungs. While accumulation of iNOS(+) macrophages was attenuated in Gal-3+ mice, increased numbers of enlarged MR-1+ macrophages were noted. This correlated with increased numbers of macrophages in BAL. Flow cytometric analysis showed that these cells were CD11b(+) and consisted mainly (&gt;97%) of mature (F4/80(+)CD11c(+)) proinflammatory (Ly6GLy6C(hi)) and anti-inflammatory (Ly6GLy6C(lo)) macrophages. Increases in both macrophage subpopulations were observed following ozone inhalation. Loss of Gal-3 resulted in a decrease in Ly6C(hi) macrophages, with no effect on Ly6C(lo) macrophages. CD11b(+)Ly6G(+)Ly6C(+) granulocytic (G) and monocytic (M) myeloid derived suppressor cells (MDSC) were also identified in the lung after ozone. In Gal-3(-/-) mice, the response of G-MDSC to ozone was attenuated, while the response of M-MDSC was heightened. Changes in inflammatory cell populations in the lung of ozone treated Gal-3(-/-) mice were correlated with reduced tissue injury as measured by cytochrome b5 expression.

This study first determines the likelihood of summertime extreme air pollution events within weather types using spatial synoptic classification. Second, it examines the modifying effect of weather types on the relative risk of mortality (RR) due to daily concentrations of air pollution (nitrogen dioxide, ozone, sulfur dioxide, and particulate matter &lt;2.5 ?m). We assess both single- and two-pollutant interactions to determine dependent and independent pollutant effects using the relatively new time series technique of distributed lag nonlinear modeling (DLNM). Results display dry tropical (DT) and moist tropical plus (MT+) weathers to result in a fourfold and twofold increased likelihood, respectively, of an extreme pollution event (top 5 % of pollution concentrations throughout the 28 years) occurring. We also demonstrate statistically significant effects of single-pollutant exposure on mortality (p?&lt;?0.05) to be dependent on summer weather type, where stronger results occur in dry moderate (fair weather) and DT or MT+ weather types. The overall average single-effect RR increases due to pollutant exposure within DT and MT+ weather types are 14.9 and 11.9 %, respectively. Adjusted exposures (two-way pollutant effect estimates) generally results in decreased RR estimates, indicating that the pollutants are not independent. Adjusting for ozone significantly lowers 67 % of the single-pollutant RR estimates and reduces model variability, which demonstrates that ozone significantly controls a portion of the mortality signal from the model.

Many air pollutant sources also emit carbon dioxide (CO2), the dominant anthropogenic greenhouse gas (GHG). The two main contributors to non-attainment of U.S. ambient air quality standards, ozone (O3) and particulate matter (PM), interact with radiation, forcing climate change. PM warms by absorbing sunlight (e.g., black carbon) or cools by scattering sunlight (e.g., sulfates) and interacts with clouds; these radiative and microphysical interactions can induce changes in precipitation and regional circulation patterns. Climate change is expected to degrade air quality in many polluted regions by changing air pollution meteorology (ventilation and dilution), precipitation and other removal processes, and by triggering some amplifying responses in atmospheric chemistry and in anthropogenic and natural sources. Together, these processes shape distributions and extreme episodes of O3 and PM. Global modeling indicates that as air pollution programs reduce SO2 to meet health and other air quality goals, near-term warming accelerates due to ""unmasking"" of warming induced by rising CO2. Air pollutant controls on CH4, a potent GHG and precursor to global O3 levels, and on sources with high black carbon (BC) to organic carbon (OC) ratios could offset near-term warming induced by SO2 emission reductions, while reducing global background O3 and regionally high levels of PM. Lowering peak warming requires decreasing atmospheric CO2, which for some source categories would also reduce co-emitted air pollutants or their precursors. Model projections for alternative climate and air quality scenarios indicate a wide range for U.S. surface O3 and fine PM, although regional projections may be confounded by interannual to decadal natural climate variability. Continued implementation of U.S. NOx emission controls guards against rising pollution levels triggered either by climate change or by global emission growth. Improved accuracy and trends in emission inventories are critical for accountability analyses of historical and projected air pollution and climate mitigation policies.<br /><br /><strong>IMPLICATIONS: </strong>The expansion of U.S. air pollution policy to protect climate provides an opportunity for joint mitigation, with CH4 a prime target. BC reductions in developing nations would lower the global health burden, and for BC-rich sources (e.g., diesel) may lessen warming. Controls on these emissions could offset near-term warming induced by health-motivated reductions of sulfate (cooling). Wildfires, dust, and other natural PM and O3 sources may increase with climate warming, posing challenges to implementing and attaining air quality standards.

To determine whether short-term exposure to ambient levels of ozone causes changes in biomarkers of cardiovascular disease including heart rate variability (HRV), systemic inflammation, and coagulability, 26 subjects were exposed to 0, 100, and 200 ppb ozone in random order for 4 h with intermittent exercise. HRV was measured and blood samples were obtained immediately before (0 h), immediately after (4 h), and 20 h after (24 h) each exposure. Bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) was performed 20 h after exposure. Regression modeling was used to examine dose-response trends between the endpoints and ozone exposure. Inhalation of ozone induced dose-dependent adverse changes in the frequency domains of HRV across exposures consistent with increased sympathetic tone [increase of (parameter estimate +/- SE) 0.4 +/- 0.2 and 0.3 +/- 0.1 in low-to high-frequency domain HRV ratio per 100 ppb increase in ozone at 4 h and 24 h, respectively (P = 0.02 and P = 0.01)] and a dosedependent increase in serum C-reactive protein (CRP) across exposures at 24 h [increase of 0.61 +/- 0.24 mg/l in CRP per 100 ppb increase in ozone (P = 0.01)]. Changes in HRV and CRP did not correlate with ozone-induced local lung inflammatory responses (BAL granulocytes, IL-6, or IL-8), but changes in HRV and CRP were associated with each other after adjustment for age and ozone level.

Objectives: We analyzed the association between long-term exposure to air pollution and mortality at the individual level in a large French cohort followed from 1989 to 2013. Methods: The study sample consisted of 20,327 adults working at the French national electricity and gas company EDF-GDF. Annual exposure to PM10, PM10-2.5, PM2.3, NO2, O-3, SO2, and benzene was assessed for the place of residence of participants using a chemistry-transport model and taking residential history into account. Hazard ratios were estimated using a Cox proportional-hazards regression model, adjusted for selected individual and contextual risk factors. Hazard ratios were computed for an interquartile range (IQR) increase in air pollutant concentrations. Results: The cohort recorded 1967 non-accidental deaths. Long-term exposures to baseline PM2.3, Phil(10-25), NO2 and benzene were associated with an increase in non-accidental mortality (Hazard Ratio, HR = 1.09; 95% Cl: 0.99, 120 per 5.9 mu g/m(3), PM10-25; HR = 1.09; 95%CI: 1.04, 1.15 per 2.2 mu g/m(3), NO2: HR = 1.14; 95% CI: 0.99, 131 per 19.3 mu g/m(3) and benzene: HR= 1.10; 95% CI: 1.00, 122 per 1.7 mu g/m(3)).The strongest association was found for PM10: HR = 1.14; 95% CI: 1.05, 125 per 7.8 mu g/m(3). PM10, PM10-25 and SO2 were associated with non-accidental mortality when using time varying exposure. No significant associations were observed between air pollution and cardiovascular and respiratory mortality. Conclusion: Long-term exposure to fine particles, nitrogen dioxide, sulfur dioxide and benzene is associated-with an increased risk of non-accidental mortality in France. Our results strengthen existing evidence that outdoor air pollution is a significant environmental risk factor for mortality.

The O3-induced decline in in vivo pollen viability was reflected in increased numbers of non-fertilized and fertilized non-viable ovules in immature fruit. Negative effects of O3 on fertilization occurred regardless of the timing of exposure, with reductions in ovule viability evident in O3 ? CFA and CFA ? O3 crossed plants. This suggests O3-induced reductions in fertilization were associated with reduced pollen viability and/or ovule development. Fruit born on trusses independently exposed to 100 nmol mol(-1) O3 (10 h d(-1)) from flowering exhibited a decline in seed number and this was reflected in a marked decline in the weight and size of individual fruit - a clear demonstration of the direct consequence of the effects of the pollutant on reproductive processes.

However, the mechanisms through which O3 exerts toxic effects on the brain remain poorly understood. We previously showed that O3 exposure caused a neuronal activation in regions of the rat nucleus tractus solitarii (NTS) overlapping terminal fields of vagal lung afferents. Knowing that O3 exposure can impact astrocytic protein expression, we decided to investigate whether it may induce astroglial cellular alterations in the NTS. Using electron microscopy and immunoblot techniques, we showed that in O3 -exposed animals, the astrocytic coverage of NTS glutamatergic synapses was 19% increased while the astrocyte volume fraction and membrane density were not modified. Moreover, the expression of glial fibrillary acidic protein and S100?, which are known to be increased in reactive astroglia, did not change. These results indicate that O3 inhalation induces a glial plasticity that is restricted to the peri-synaptic coverage without overall astroglial activation. Taken together, these findings, along with our previous observations, support the conclusion that O3 -induced pulmonary inflammation results in a specific activation of vagal lung afferents rather than non-specific overall brain alterations mediated by blood-borne agents. Exposure to ozone, a major atmospheric pollutant, induces an increase in the glial coverage of neurons that is restricted to peri-synaptic compartments. This observation does not support the view that the ozone-induced neuronal disorders are related to non-specific overall brain alterations. It rather argues for a specific activation of the vagus nerve in response to pulmonary inflammation.",0,0,7.2.1.3.1,Toxicological Studies

Although early-onset (familial) AD is attributed to gene mutations, the cause for late-onset (sporadic) AD, which accounts for 95% of AD cases, is unknown. In this study, we show that exposure of 6-week-old amyloid beta precursor protein (APP)/presenilin (PS1) overexpressing mice, a well-established animal model of AD, and nontransgenic littermates to a cyclic O-3 exposure protocol, which mimics environmental exposure episodes, accelerated learning/memory function loss in male APP/PS1 mice but not in female APP/PS1 mice or nontransgenic littermates. Female APP/PS1 mice had higher brain levels of amyloid beta peptide (A beta 42) and A beta 40, compared with male APP/PS1 mice; O-3 exposure, however, had no significant effect on brain A beta load in either male or female mice. Our results further show that male APP/PS1 mice had lower levels of antioxidants (glutathione and ascorbate) and experienced augmented induction of NADPH oxidases, lipid peroxidation, and neuronal apoptosis upon O-3 exposure, compared with female APP/PS1 mice. No significant effect of O-3 on any of these parameters was detected in nontransgenic littermates. In vitro studies further show that 4-hydroxynonenal, a lipid peroxidation product which was increased in the plasma and cortex/hippocampus of O-3-exposed male APP/PS1 mice, induced neuroblastoma cell apoptosis.

There is a need for suitable translational animal models to study the role of oxidative stress in depression and antidepressant action.<br /><br /><strong>OBJECTIVE: </strong>Considering the gene X environment hypothesis of depression, the present study investigated the effect of chronic ozone inhalation on depression and anxiety-related behavior, cognition, and brain markers of oxidative stress in the Flinders Sensitive Line (FSL) rat. In addition, response to the antioxidant melatonin, and the antidepressants desipramine or escitalopram, was assessed.<br /><br /><strong>METHODS: </strong>Rats were exposed to ozone (0.0 or 0.3 parts per million (ppm)) per inhalation for 4 h daily for a period of 15 days, while simultaneously receiving saline or the above-mentioned drugs.<br /><br /><strong>RESULTS: </strong>The data indicate that chronic ozone inhalation induced memory impairment, anxiety and depression-like effects, reduced cortical and hippocampal superoxide dismutase and catalase activity, and compromised central monoamine levels similar to that noted in depression. Moreover, the behavioral and neurochemical effects of melatonin, desipramine, and escitalopram were mostly attenuated in the presence of ozone.<br /><br /><strong>CONCLUSION: </strong>Thus, genetically susceptible individuals exposed to high levels of oxidative stress are at higher risk of developing mood and/or an anxiety disorders, showing greater redox imbalance and altered behavior. These animals are also more resistant to contemporary antidepressant treatment.

A case-crossover analysis was performed on a population of patients hospitalized in a large tertiary teaching hospital between 2006 and 2010 with first life occurrence of atrial fibrillation; 1458 patients were admitted to the hospital with new-onset AF. AF onset was associated with an interquartile range elevation of carbon monoxide concentrations during the winter season (odds ratio 1.15, p = 0.040) and sulfur dioxide concentrations during the fall season (odds ratio 1.21, p = 0.028). An interquartile range elevation in nitric dioxide concentration was associated with AF onset only among patients younger than 65 years of age (odds ratio 1.08, p = 0.025). Patients with diabetes mellitus or chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder had higher susceptibility for carbon monoxide-associated AF development. Short-term exposure to carbon monoxide, nitric dioxide, and sulfur dioxide was associated with AF onset, suggesting that these pollutants, originating primarily from traffic, might trigger new AF.

Using birth certificate records in Texas from 2002 to 2004 and Environmental Protection Agency air pollution estimates, we relate the quantile functions of birth weight and gestational age to ozone exposure and multiple predictors, including parental age, race, and education level. We introduce a semi-parametric Bayesian quantile approach that models the full quantile function rather than just a few quantile levels. Our multilevel quantile function model establishes relationships between birth weight and the predictors separately for each week of gestational age and between gestational age and the predictors separately across Texas Public Health Regions. We permit these relationships to vary nonlinearly across gestational age, spatial domain and quantile level and we unite them in a hierarchical model via a basis expansion on the regression coefficients that preserves interpretability. Very low birth weight is a primary concern, so we leverage extreme value theory to supplement our model in the tail of the distribution. Gestational ages are recorded in completed weeks of gestation (integer-valued), so we present methodology for modeling quantile functions of discrete response data. In a simulation study we show that pooling information across gestational age and quantile level substantially reduces MSE of predictor effects.

O-3 stress can influence the potential methane oxidation rate (PMOR) and potential methane production rate (PMPR) in the farmland soil. O-3 treatment of 40 ppb improved significantly the 16S rRNA gene copy number in the total methanotrophic bacteria pmoA, and type land type II methanotrophic bacteria in the soil depth of 0 -20 cm. When the O-3 concentration reached 120 ppb, the 16S rRNA gene copy number in the total methanotrophic bacteria pmoA and type I methanotrophic bacteria decreased significantly as compared to the control treatment in 10-20 cm layer. The 16s rRNA gene copy number of total methanotrophic bacteria pmoA and type I and type II methanotrophic bacteria were influenced by different O-3 concentration and soil depth.

Typically, receiving a signal from a damaged neighbour enhances the defensive attributes of a receiver plant. The mechanisms underlying plant-plant interactions may be divided into active and passive processes, both of which involve transit of VOCs between plants and are vulnerable to environmental perturbation. Numerous studies have documented between-plant interactions, but the specific effects on a receiver plant's interactions with herbivores have received little attention. Moreover, the relative contributions of active and passive processes to plant defence and the effects of environmental pollutants on the processes have been largely unexplored. We used a system comprising Brassica oleracea var. italica (broccoli) and the specialist herbivore Plutella xylostella to test whether plants previously exposed to herbivore-damaged neighbours differed from nonexposed plants in their susceptibility to oviposition. We then investigated the roles of active and passive mechanisms in our observations and whether differences in susceptibility remained under elevated ozone concentrations. Plants exposed to herbivore-damaged neighbours were more susceptible to oviposition than plants exposed to undamaged neighbours, which indicates associational susceptibility. Mechanistically, active and passive volatile-mediated processes occurred in tandem with the passive process - involving adsorption of sesquiterpenes to receiver plants - appearing to structure the oviposition response. Exposure to ozone rapidly degraded the sesquiterpenes and eliminated the associational susceptibility. Plant volatiles have typically been thought to play roles in between-plant interactions and to promote receiver plant defence. Here, we show that receiver plants may also become more susceptible to oviposition and thus more likely to be damaged.

In addition to directly increasing radiative forcing as a greenhouse gas, O-3 indirectly impacts climate through altering the plant processes of photosynthesis and transpiration. While global estimates of gross primary productivity (GPP) have incorporated the effects of O-3, few studies have explicitly determined the independent effects of O-3 on transpiration. In this study, the authors include effects of O-3 on photosynthesis and stomatal conductance from a recent literature review to determine the impact on GPP and transpiration and highlight uncertainty in modeling plant responses to O-3. Using the Community Land Model, the authors estimate that present-day O-3 exposure reduces GPP and transpiration globally by 8%-12% and 2%-2.4%, respectively. The largest reductions were in midlatitudes, with GPP decreasing up to 20% in the eastern United States, Europe, and Southeast Asia and transpiration reductions of up to 15% in the same regions. Larger reductions in GPP compared to transpiration decreased water-use efficiency 5%-10% in the eastern United States, Southeast Asia, Europe, and central Africa; increased surface runoff more than 15% in eastern North America; and altered patterns of energy fluxes in the tropics, high latitudes, and eastern North America. Future climate predictions will be improved if plant responses to O-3 are incorporated into models such that stomatal conductance is modified independently of photosynthesis and the effects on transpiration are explicitly considered in surface energy budgets. Improvements will help inform regional decisions for managing changes in hydrology and surface temperatures in response to O-3 pollution.",0,0,8.11.3,Models of Plant Water Use

The overall RRs differed across age groups, with associations for all pollutants consistently strongest for children aged 5-18 years. The patterns of association across age groups remained generally consistent when models were stratified by sex and race, although the strong observed associations among 5-18 year olds appeared to be partially driven by non-white and male patients.

We focused on the effects of ground-level ozone, a major air pollutant, in the expression and regulation of lung immunity genes. We exposed adult male and female mice to 2 ppm of ozone or filtered air (control) for 3 hours.

We also evaluated changes in lung histology and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid cell counts and protein content at 24 and 72 hours post exposure. Our results revealed sex differences in lung inflammation triggered by ozone exposure, and in the expression of genes involved in acute phase and inflammatory responses. Major sex differences were found in the expression of neutrophil-attracting chemokines (Ccl20, Cxcl5, and Cxcl2), the pro-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-6, and oxidative stress related enzymes (Ptgs2, Nos2). In addition, the phosphorylation of STAT3, known to mediate IL-6-related immune responses, was significantly higher in ozone-exposed mice.

For short-lived compounds, ERF can be highly inhomogeneous geographically. The relationship between the spatial patterns of ERF and surface temperature response is poorly characterized, however. We examine that relationship in the latest generation of global climate models. We find that the uneven distribution of historical aerosol, ozone, and land use forcing leads to substantial differences compared to the well-mixed greenhouse gases (WMGHG). There is a stronger response per unit global mean forcing to historical inhomogeneous forcing than to WMGHG both globally and in much of the Northern Hemisphere (NH) extratropics, in fairly good agreement with results inferred from observations. Our results indicate that the enhanced global mean response is attributable to the concentration of inhomogeneous forcing in the NH extratropics, where there is strongest sensitivity to forcing, rather than to processes specific to the inhomogeneous forcers. In many regions, inclusion of inhomogeneous forcing greatly increases the spread in historical temperature changes simulated by the models, suggesting that better forcing characterization could play an important role in improving modeling of decadal-scale regional climate change. Finally, incorporating observed temperatures, the results provide estimates of global historical aerosol forcing (-1.00.4Wm(-2)) consistent with other studies (though with narrower uncertainties) and also provide constraints on NH and NH extratropical historical aerosol forcing (-1.40.6 and -1.20.6Wm(-2), respectively) and aerosol+ozone forcing.",0,0,9.3.1,Recent Evidence for Effects on Temperature

Results from long-term epidemiological studies on O3 are scarce and inconclusive.

OBJECTIVES: This paper examines the association between chronic ambient O3 exposure and all-cause and cause-specific mortality in a large cohort of U.S. adults.

METHODS: Cancer Prevention Study-II participants were enrolled in 1982. A total of 669,046 participants were analyzed among which 237,201 deaths were observed through 2004. We obtained estimates of O3 concentrations at the participant residence from a Hierarchical Bayesian Space Time Model. Estimates of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) concentrations were obtained from land-use regression. Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to examine mortality associations adjusted for individual- and ecological-level covariates.

MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: In single-pollutant models, we observed significant positive associations between O3, PM2.5, and NO2 with all-cause and cause-specific mortality. In two-pollutant models adjusting for PM2.5, significant positive associations remained between O3 and all-cause (HR per 10 ppb = 1.02, 95% CI 1.01-1.04), circulatory (HR = 1.03, 95% CI 1.01-1.05), and respiratory mortality (HR = 1.12, 95% CI 1.08-1.16) that were unchanged with further adjustment for NO2. There were also positive mortality associations observed with both PM2.5 (both near-source and regional) and NO2 in multi-pollutant models.

CONCLUSIONS: Findings from this large-scale prospective study suggest that long-term ambient O3 contributes to risk of respiratory and circulatory mortality.

Among women, an increased prevalence of obesity was associated with an interquartile range increase in PM10 (19 mu g/m(3); odds ratio [ORs] = 1.18; 95% confidence interval [CI]:1.06-1.32), NO2 (9 mu g/m(3); ORs = 1.24; 95% Cl: 1.09-1.41), and O-3 (22 mu g/m(3); ORs = 1.14; 95% Cl: 1.01-1.30). Associations were stronger among older participants. In conclusion, this study reveals a positive association between the long-term exposure to ambient air pollution and increased prevalence of obesity, and that these associations were more apparent in women than in men.

We hypothesized that acute exposure of healthy rats to ozone will cause transcriptional alterations, and comprehensive analysis of these changes will allow us to better understand the mechanism of pulmonary injury and inflammation. Male Wistar Kyoto rats (10-12 week) were exposed to air, or ozone (0.25, 0.5 or 1.0ppm) for 4h and pulmonary injury and inflammation were assessed at 0-h or 20-h (n=8/group). Lung gene expression profiling was assessed at 0-h (air and 1.0ppm ozone, n=3-4/group). At 20-h bronchoalveolar lavage, fluid protein and neutrophils increased at 1ppm ozone. Numerous genes involved in acute inflammatory response were up-regulated along with changes in genes involved in cell adhesion and migration, steroid metabolism, apoptosis, cell cycle control and cell growth. A number of NRF2 target genes were also induced after ozone exposure. Based on expression changes, Rela, SP1 and TP3-mediated signaling were identified to be mediating downstream changes. Remarkable changes in the processes of endocytosis provide the insight that ozone-induced lung injury and inflammation are likely initiated by changes in cell membrane components and receptors likely from oxidatively modified lung lining lipids and proteins. In conclusion, ozone-induced injury and inflammation are preceded by changes in gene targets for cell adhesion/migration, apoptosis, cell cycle control and growth regulated by Rela, SP1 and TP53, likely mediated by the process of endocytosis and altered steroid receptor signaling.",0,0,3.1.4.4.2,Animal Toxicological Studies

At baseline, the JCR exhibited the largest difference in the number of genes among all strains when compared with WKY. Interestingly, the number of genes affected by ozone was inversely correlated with genes different at baseline relative to WKY. A cluster of NFkB target genes involved in cell-adhesion, antioxidant response, inflammation and apoptosis was induced in all strains, albeit at different levels (JCR<WKY<SHHF<SH<SHSP). The lung metabolic syndrome gene cluster indicated expressions in opposite directions for SHHF and JCR suggesting different mechanisms for common disease phenotype and perhaps obesity-independent contribution to exacerbated lung disease. The differences in expression of adrenergic receptors and ion-channel genes suggested distinct mechanisms by which ozone might induce protein leakage in CVD models, especially SHHF and JCR. Thus, the pulmonary response to ozone in CVD strains was likely linked to the defining gene expression profiles.

The chronic hyperglycemia of diabetes is associated with long-term damage, dysfunction, and failure of different organs, especially the eyes, kidneys, nerves, heart, and blood vessels.

Several pathogenic processes are involved in the development of diabetes. These range from autoimmune destruction of the pancreatic ?-cells with consequent insulin deficiency to abnormalities that result in resistance to insulin action. The basis of the abnormalities in carbohydrate, fat, and protein metabolism in diabetes is deficient action of insulin on target tissues. Deficient insulin action results from inadequate insulin secretion and/or diminished tissue responses to insulin at one or more points in the complex pathways of hormone action. Impairment of insulin secretion and defects in insulin action frequently coexist in the same patient, and it is often unclear which abnormality, if either alone, is the primary cause of the hyperglycemia.

Symptoms of marked hyperglycemia include polyuria, polydipsia, weight loss, sometimes with polyphagia, and blurred vision. Impairment of growth and susceptibility to certain infections may also accompany chronic hyperglycemia. Acute, life-threatening consequences of uncontrolled diabetes are hyperglycemia with ketoacidosis or the nonketotic hyperosmolar syndrome.

Long-term complications of diabetes include retinopathy with potential loss of vision; nephropathy leading to renal failure; peripheral neuropathy with risk of foot ulcers, amputations, and Charcot joints; and autonomic neuropathy causing gastrointestinal, genitourinary, and cardiovascular symptoms and sexual dysfunction. Patients with diabetes have an increased incidence of atherosclerotic cardiovascular, peripheral arterial, and cerebrovascular disease. Hypertension and abnormalities of lipoprotein metabolism are often found in people with diabetes.

The vast majority of cases of diabetes fall into two broad etiopathogenetic categories (discussed in greater detail below). In one category, type 1 diabetes, the cause is an absolute deficiency of insulin secretion. Individuals at increased risk of developing this type of diabetes can often be identified by serological evidence of an autoimmune pathologic process occurring in the pancreatic islets and by genetic markers. In the other, much more prevalent category, type 2 diabetes, the cause is a combination of resistance to insulin action and an inadequate compensatory insulin secretory response. In the latter category, a degree of hyperglycemia sufficient to cause pathologic and functional changes in various target tissues, but without clinical symptoms, may be present for a long period of time before diabetes is detected. During this asymptomatic period, it is possible to demonstrate an abnormality in carbohydrate metabolism by measurement of plasma glucose in the fasting state or after a challenge with an oral glucose load or by A1C.

The degree of hyperglycemia (if any) may change over time, depending on the extent of the underlying disease process (Fig. 1). A disease process may be present but may not have progressed far enough to cause hyperglycemia. The same disease process can cause impaired fasting glucose (IFG) and/or impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) without fulfilling the criteria for the diagnosis of diabetes. In some individuals with diabetes, adequate glycemic control can be achieved with weight reduction, exercise, and/or oral glucose-lowering agents. These individuals therefore do not require insulin. Other individuals who have some residual insulin secretion but require exogenous insulin for adequate glycemic control can survive without it. Individuals with extensive ?-cell destruction and therefore no residual insulin secretion require insulin for survival. The severity of the metabolic abnormality can progress, regress, or stay the same. Thus, the degree of hyperglycemia reflects the severity of the underlying metabolic process and its treatment more than the nature of the process itself.",0,0,5.1,"Short Term Ozone Exposure?????Introduction, Summary from the 213 Ozone ISA, and Scope for Current Review"

A computer-solved model has been used to predict the homeostatic concentrations which arise from varying degrees beta-cell deficiency and insulin resistance. Comparison of a patient's fasting values with the model's predictions allows a quantitative assessment of the contributions of insulin resistance and deficient beta-cell function to the fasting hyperglycaemia (homeostasis model assessment, HOMA). The accuracy and precision of the estimate have been determined by comparison with independent measures of insulin resistance and beta-cell function using hyperglycaemic and euglycaemic clamps and an intravenous glucose tolerance test. The estimate of insulin resistance obtained by homeostasis model assessment correlated with estimates obtained by use of the euglycaemic clamp (Rs = 0.88, p less than 0.0001), the fasting insulin concentration (Rs = 0.81, p less than 0.0001), and the hyperglycaemic clamp, (Rs = 0.69, p less than 0.01). There was no correlation with any aspect of insulin-receptor binding. The estimate of deficient beta-cell function obtained by homeostasis model assessment correlated with that derived using the hyperglycaemic clamp (Rs = 0.61, p less than 0.01) and with the estimate from the intravenous glucose tolerance test (Rs = 0.64, p less than 0.05). The low precision of the estimates from the model (coefficients of variation: 31% for insulin resistance and 32% for beta-cell deficit) limits its use, but the correlation of the model's estimates with patient data accords with the hypothesis that basal glucose and insulin interactions are largely determined by a simple feed back loop.",0,0,5.2.5,Development of Diabetes

Previously, environmentally controlled human exposure chambers have been used to study DE and O3 dose-response patterns separately, but investigation of co-exposures has not been performed under controlled conditions. Because a mixture is a more realistic exposure scenario for the general public, in this study we investigate the relationships of urban levels of urban-level DE exposure (300 ?g/m3), O3 (0.3 ppm), DE + O3 co-exposure, and innate immune system responses.

The white blood cell differential counts showed significant monocyte and lymphocyte decreases and neutrophil increases following the DE + O3 exposure; lymphocytes and neutrophils changes also persist for at least 22-hours.

A multilevel logistic model was used to estimate the association of changes in pollution levels with bronchitic symptoms. 

EXPOSURES Average concentrations of nitrogen dioxide, ozone, particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter of less than 10 mu m (PM10) and less than 2.5 mu m (PM2.5). 

MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Annual age-specific prevalence of bronchitic symptoms during the previous 12 months based on the parent's or child's report of a daily cough for 3 months in a row, congestion or phlegm other than when accompanied by a cold, or bronchitis. 

RESULTS The 3 cohorts included a total of 4602 children (mean age at baseline, 8.0 years; 2268 girls [49.3%]; 2081 Hispanic white [45.2%]) who had data from 2 or more annual questionnaires. Among these children, 892 (19.4%) had asthma at age 10 years. For nitrogen dioxide, the odds ratio (OR) for bronchitic symptoms among children with asthma at age 10 years was 0.79 (95% CI, 0.67-0.94) for a median reduction of 4.9 ppb, with absolute decrease in prevalence of 10.1%. For ozone, the OR was 0.66 (95% CI, 0.50-0.86) for a median reduction of 3.6 ppb, with an absolute decrease in prevalence of 16.3%. For PM10, the OR was 0.61 (95% CI, 0.48-0.78) for a median reduction of 5.8 mu g/m(3), with an absolute decrease in prevalence of 18.7%. For PM2.5, the OR was 0.68 (95% CI, 0.53-0.86) for a median reduction of 6.8 mu g/m(3), with absolute decrease in prevalence of 15.4%. Among children without asthma (n = 3710), the ORs were 0.84 (95% CI, 0.76-0.92) for nitrogen dioxide, 0.85 (95% CI, 0.74-0.97) for ozone, 0.80 (95% CI, 0.70-0.92) for PM10, and 0.79 (95% CI, 0.69-0.91) for PM2.5; with absolute decrease in prevalence of 1.8% for nitrogen dioxide, 1.7% for ozone, 2.2% for PM10, and 2.3% for PM2.5. The associations were similar or slightly stronger at age 15 years.

Recent studies suggest that air pollution plays a role in type 2 diabetes (T2D) incidence and mortality. The underlying physiological mechanisms have yet to be established. We hypothesized that air pollution adversely affects insulin sensitivity and secretion and serum lipid levels.

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS
Participants were selected from BetaGene (n = 1,023), a study of insulin resistance and pancreatic b-cell function in Mexican Americans. All participants underwent DXA and oral and intravenous glucose tolerance tests and completed dietary and physical activity questionnaires. Ambient air pollutant concentrations (NO2, O3, and PM2.5) for short- and long-term periods were assigned by spatial interpolation (maximum interpolation radius of 50 km) of data from air quality monitors. Traffic related air pollution from freeways (TRAP) was estimated using the dispersion model as NOx. Variance component models were used to analyze individual and multiple air pollutant associations with metabolic traits.

RESULTS
Short-term (up to 58 days cumulative lagged averages) exposure to PM2.5 was associated with lower insulin sensitivity and HDL-to-LDL cholesterol ratio and higher fasting glucose and insulin, HOMA-IR, total cholesterol, and LDL cholesterol (LDL-C) (all P # 0.036).

In the bias-corrected cohort where associations were somewhat stronger, elevated odds ratios (ORs) per 10 parts per billion increase in O-3 exposure (county-level metric) were detected for the fifth (OR = 1.08, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.04-1.12), sixth (OR = 1.05, 95% Cl = 1.01-1.09), and seventh (OR = 1.07, 95% CI = 1.03-1.10) 4-week periods of pregnancy for late PTB (33-36 completed weeks gestation), the fifth (OR = 1.13, 95% CI = 1.02-1.25) and seventh (OR = 1.15, 95% CI = 1.04-1.27) 4-week periods of pregnancy for moderate PTB (29-32 completed weeks gestation), and the fifth (OR = 1.21, 95% CI = 1.08-1.36) 4-week period of pregnancy for severe PTB (20-28 completed weeks gestation). Conversely, decreased odds were found in the first 4-week period of pregnancy for severe PTB (OR = 0.83, 95% CI = 0.74-0.94). Associations were slightly attenuated using the spatially interpolated (kriged) metrics, and for women who did not work outside of the home.

Stomatal conductance (g(s)) is both an impact of these stressors and a protective response to them. Stomatal closure reduces inward flux of O-3 and outward flux of water. Stomatal measurements are generally obtained at midday when gas exchange is maximal, but these may not be adequate surrogates for stomatal responses observed at other times of day, nor for non-stomatal responses. Here, we find in Pima cotton that stomatal responses to O-3 observed at midday do not reflect responses at other times. Stomata were more responsive to O-3 and WD near midday, despite being at quasi-steady state, than during periods of active opening or closing in morning or evening. Stomatal responsivity to O-3 was not coincident with maximum gas exchange or with periods of active regulation, but coincident with plant sensitivity to O-3 previously determined in this cultivar. Responses of pigmentation and shoot productivity were more closely related to stomatal responses at midday than to responses at other times of day under well-watered (WW) conditions, reflecting higher stomatal responsivity, sensitivity to O-3, and magnitude of midday gs. Under WD conditions, shoot responses were more closely related to early morning gs. Root responses were more closely related to early morning gs under both WW and WD.

Inflammatory lung disease induced by air pollution has demonstrated greater severity and poorer prognosis in women vs. men. Both severe damage to the bronchial-alveolar epithelium and malfunctioning of bronchial-blood barrier have been largely attributed to the pathobiology of O-3-induced inflammatory response, but the associated mechanisms in the male and female lung remain unknown.
<br>
<br>Methods: Here, we investigated sex-based differential regulation of lung interleukin-6 (IL-6) and its downstream signaling pathways JAK2/STAT3 and AKT1/NF-kappa B in response to O-3 exposure in a mouse model. We exposed male and female mice (in different stages of the estrous cycle) to 2 ppm of O-3 or filtered air (FA) for 3 h, and we harvested lung tissue for protein expression analysis by Western blot.
<br>
<br>Results: We found significant up-regulation of IL-6 and IL-6R in females and IL-6 in males in response to O-3 vs. FA. Ozone exposure induced a significant increase in STAT3-Y705 phosphorylation in both females and males. Males exposed to O-3 had decreased levels of JAK2, but increased JAK2 (Y1007+Y1008) phosphorylation, while females exposed to O-3 showed significant up-regulation of both proteins. Both NF-kappa B (p105/p50) and AKT1 protein levels were significantly increased only in females exposed to O-3. In addition, females exposed to O-3 during proestrus displayed increased expression of selected genes when compared to females exposed to O-3 in other estrous cycle stages.

The mechanisms regulating ozone-induced airway inflammation remain poorly understood. We hypothesize that ozone-triggered inflammasome activation and interleukin (IL)-1 production regulate neutrophilic airway inflammation through IL-17A. Pulmonary neutrophilic inflammation was induced by extended (72 h) low-dose (0.7 ppm) exposure to ozone. IL-1 receptor 1 (Il1r1)(-/-), Il17 alpha(-/-) mice and the caspase-1 inhibitor acetyl-YVAD-chloromethylketone (Ac-YVAD-cmk) were used for in vivo studies. Cellular inflammation and protein levels in bronchial alveolar lavage fluid (BALF), cytokines, and IL-17A-producing gamma delta T-cells, as well as mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS), mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) release, and inflammasome activation in lung macrophages were analyzed. Ozone-induced neutrophilic airway inflammation, accompanied an increased production of IL-1 beta, IL-18, IL-17A, Granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF), Interferon-gamma inducible protein 10 (IP-10) and BALF protein in the lung. Ozone-induced IL-17A production was predominantly in.dT-cells, and Il17 alpha-knockout mice exhibited reduced airway inflammation. Lung macrophages from ozone-exposed mice exhibited higher levels of mitochondrial ROS, enhanced cytosolic mtDNA, increased caspase-1 activation, and higher production of IL-1 beta. Il1r1-knockout mice or treatment with Ac-YVAD-cmk decreased the IL-17A production and subsequent airway inflammation.

<br>
<br>OBJECTIVE: We examined relationships between ozone and EDVs for respiratory visits, including specifically acute respiratory infections (ARI), asthma, pneumonia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and upper respiratory tract inflammation (URTI).
<br>
<br>METHODS: We conducted a multi-site time-stratified case-crossover study of ozone exposures for approximately 3.7 million respiratory EDVs from 2005 through 2008 among California residents living within 20 km of an ozone monitor. Conditional logistic regression was used to estimate associations by climate zone. Random effects meta-analysis was then applied to estimate pooled excess risks (ER). Effect modification by season, distance from the monitor and individual demographic characteristics (i. e., age, race/ethnicity, sex, and payment method), and confounding by other gaseous air pollutants were also investigated. Meta-regression was utilized to explore how climate zone-level meteorological, demographic, and regional differences influenced estimates.

<br>RESULTS: We observed ozone-associated increases in all respiratory, asthma, and ARI visits, which were slightly larger in the warm season [asthma ER per 10-ppb increase in mean of same and previous 3 days ozone exposure (lag(03)) = 2.7%, 95% CI: 1.5, 3.9; ARI ERlag03 = 1.4%, 95% CI: 0.8, 1.9].

Ventilatory function, assessed by whole-body plethysmography, and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) biomarkers of injury and inflammation were used to examine O-3-induced pulmonary effects. Relaxation time declined in all ages following the weekly exposures; however, this effect persisted only in the 24mo rats following a five days recovery, demonstrating an inability to induce adaptation commonly seen with repeated O-3 exposures. PenH was increased in all groups with an augmented response in the 4mo rats following the subchronic O-3 exposures. O-3 led to increased breathing frequency and minute volume in the 1 and 4mo animals. Markers of pulmonary permeability were increased in all age groups. Elevations in BALF gamma-glutamyl transferase activity and lung inflammation following an acute O-3 exposure were noted in only the 1 and 4mo rats, which likely received an increased effective O-3 dose.

Molecular methods were used to characterize the AM fungal communities of soybean (Glycine max) grown under elevated and ambient atmospheric concentrations of both CO2 and O-3 within a free air concentration enrichment experiment in three growing seasons over 5yr. Elevated CO2 altered the community composition of AM fungi, increasing the ratio of Glomeraceae to Gigasporaceae. By contrast, no effect of elevated O-3 on AM fungal communities was detected. However, the greatest compositional differences detected were between years, suggesting that, at least in the short term, large-scale interannual temporal dynamics are stronger mediators than atmospheric CO2 concentrations of AM fungal communities. We conclude that, although atmospheric change may significantly alter AM fungal communities, this effect may be masked by the influences of natural changes and successional patterns through time.

Canopy damage was markedly higher in the elevated CO2 stands, as was the deposition of organic substrates and nitrogen. The opposite trends were apparent in the elevated O-3 stands. Using a light-use efficiency model, we show that the negative impacts of herbivorous insects on net primary production more than doubled under elevated concentrations of CO2, but decreased under elevated concentrations of O-3.

Although it has been well documented that elevated carbon dioxide (CO2) in the atmosphere greatly enhances biomass production in plants, the overall effect of elevated CO2 on reproductive allocation (RA), i.e., the proportion of biomass allocated to reproductive structures, is little understood. We combined meta-analysis with graphical vector analysis to examine the overall effect of elevated CO2 on RA and how other environmental factors, such as low nutrients, drought and elevated atmospheric ozone (O-3), interacted with elevated CO2 in affecting RA in herbaceous plants. Averaged across all species of different functional groups and environmental conditions, elevated CO2 had little effect on RA (-0.9 %). RA in plants of different reproductive strategies and functional groups, however, differed in response to elevated CO2. For example, RA in iteroparous wild species decreased by 8 %, while RA in iteroparous crops increased significantly (+14 %) at elevated CO2. RA was unaffected by CO2 in plants grown with no stress or in low-nutrient soils. RA decreased at elevated CO2 and elevated O-3, but increased in response to elevated CO2 in drought-stressed plants, suggesting that elevated CO2 could ameliorate the adverse effect of drought on crop production to some extent.

Combined responses to elevated temperature and O-3 have rarely been studied even though some critical growth stages such as seed initiation are sensitive to both. Under O-3 exposure, many species have smaller roots, thereby enhancing drought sensitivity. Of the 68 species assessed for stomatal responses to ozone, 22.5% were unaffected, 33.5% had sluggish or increased opening and 44% stomatal closure. The beneficial effect of N on root development was lost at higher O-3 treatments whilst the effects of increasing O-3 on root biomass became more pronounced as N increased.

Ascribable to the size-symmetric nature of belowground competition, we reasoned that differential growth responses to CO2 and O3 should shift as juvenile individuals mature, thereby altering competitive hierarchies and forest composition. In a 12-year-long forest FACE experiment, we used tracer 15N and whole-plant N content to assess belowground competitive interactions among five Populus tremuloides genotypes, between a single P. tremuloides genotype and Betula papryrifera, as well as between the same single P. tremuloides genotype and Acer saccharum. Under elevated CO2, the amount of soil N and 15N obtained by the P. tremuloides genotype common to each community was contingent on the nature of belowground competition. When this genotype competed with its congeners, it obtained equivalent amounts of soil N and tracer 15N under ambient and elevated CO2; however, its acquisition of soil N under elevated CO2 increased by a significant margin when grown in competition with B. papyrifera (+30%) and A. saccharum (+60%). In contrast, elevated O3 had no effect on soil N and 15N acquisition by the P. tremuloides genotype common in each community, regardless of competitive interactions. Under elevated CO2, the rank order of N acquisition among P. tremuloides genotypes shifted over time, indicating that growth responses to CO2 change during ontogeny; this was not the case under elevated O3. In the aspen-birch community, the competitive advantage elevated CO2 initially conveyed on birch diminished over time, whereas maple was a poor competitor for soil N in all regards.

This study assesses the impact of ozone on forest composition and ecosystem dynamics with an individual-based gap model that includes basic physiology as well as species-specific metabolic properties. Elevated tropospheric ozone leads to no reduction of forest productivity and carbon stock and to increased isoprene emissions, which result from enhanced dominance by isoprene-emitting species (which tolerate ozone stress better than non-emitters). This study suggests that tropospheric ozone may not diminish forest carbon sequestration capacity.

We analysed pasture samples from seven ozone exposure experiments comprising mesotrophic, calcareous, haymeadow and sanddune unimproved grasslands conducted in open-top chambers, solardomes and a field release system. Across all grassland types, there were significant increases in acid detergent fibre, crude fibre and lignin content with increasing ozone concentration, resulting in decreased pasture quality in terms of the metabolisable energy content of the vegetation. We derived a dose-response function for metabolisable energy of the grassland with ozone concentration, applicable to a range of grassland types, and used this to predict effects on pasture quality of UK vegetation at 1 km resolution using modelled ozone data for 2007 and for predicted higher average ozone concentrations in 2020. This showed a potential total reduction in lamb production in the UK of approximately 4% in 2020 compared to 2007. The largest impacts were in geographical areas of modest ozone increases between the two years, but where large numbers of lambs were present. For an individual farmer working to a very small cost margin this could represent a large reduction in profit, both in regions where the impacts per lamb and those where the impacts per km(2) of grazing land are largest. In the short term farmers could adapt their lamb management in response to changed forage quality by additional supplementary feed of high metabolisable energy content. Nationally this increase in annual additional feed in 2020 compared to 2007 would be 2,166 tonnes (an increase of 0.7%). Of added concern are the longer-term consequences of continual deterioration of pasture quality and the implications for changes in farming practices to compensate for potential reductions in livestock production capacity.

Sensitivity of this species to ozone (O-3) air pollution and to soil water deficit, relative to native species or competing crops, may affect its competitiveness and invasive potential. In recent years, both high tropospheric O-3 and soil water deficiency have become common in the San Joaquin Valley of California. Responses to these environmental parameters may help predict the invasiveness of this species and have implications for landscape hydrology. We assessed the impact of O-3 and soil water deficit on Palmer amaranth. Five-to seven-leaf-stage potted plants were placed in continuous stirred tank reactor chambers and maintained for 30 to 35 d under 12-h mean daylight O-3 exposures (0700-1900 hours) of 4, 59, or 114 ppb O-3. Within the chambers the plants were either well-watered (WW) or exposed to regulated deficit irrigation (RDI) and grown for about 7 wk. Dry weights of the leaves, stems, roots, and leaf area were determined. Day- and nighttime stomatal conductances (g(s)) were measured at 1.5-h intervals. Nocturnal g(s) was about 16 to 29% of daytime g(s); this suggests that the species could have substantial nighttime water loss, uncoupled from carbon gain in the weed, and could affect water availability for crops and reduce irrigation efficiency. Nocturnal g(s) was lower in the RDI than in the WW, but daytime g(s) was not affected by O-3 or irrigation regime. Neither O-3 nor irrigation regime affected root or shoot parameters. As O-3 and drought are two key stressors in the San Joaquin Valley, to which potential competing species have been found to be sensitive, Palmer amaranth may proliferate and become more invasive in the future, potentially altering landscape hydrology and reducing irrigation efficiency.",0,0,8.3.3,Connections with Community Composition and Water Cycling

A neurohormonal stress response (referred to here as a systemic response produced by activation of the sympathetic nervous system and hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal (HPA)-axis) has been implicated in a variety of psychological and physical stresses, which involves immune and metabolic homeostatic mechanisms affecting all organs in the body. In this review, we provide new evidence for the involvement of this well-characterized neurohormonal stress response in mediating systemic and pulmonary effects of a prototypic air pollutant - ozone. A plethora of systemic metabolic and immune effects are induced in animals exposed to inhaled pollutants, which could result from increased circulating stress hormones. The release of adrenal-derived stress hormones in response to ozone exposure not only mediates systemic immune and metabolic responses, but by doing so, also modulates pulmonary injury and inflammation. With recurring pollutant exposures, these effects can contribute to multi-organ chronic conditions associated with air pollution. This review will cover, 1) the potential mechanisms by which air pollutants can initiate the relay of signals from respiratory tract to brain through trigeminal and vagus nerves, and activate stress responsive regions including hypothalamus; and 2) the contribution of sympathetic and HPA-axis activation in mediating systemic homeostatic metabolic and immune effects of ozone in various organs.

Correlations between ozone and PM2.5 varied across SSC zones from -0.02 to 0.7. Comparing zones using the most populated SSC zone as a reference, a 10 ppb increase in ozone exposure was associated with increases in hazard ratios (HRs) that ranged from 1.007 (95% CI 0.99, 1.015) to 1.03 (95% CI 1.02, 1.041) for cardiovascular disease, 1.013 (95% CI 0.996, 1.03) to 1.058 (95% CI 1.034, 1.082) for cerebrovascular disease, and 1.02 (95% CI 1.006, 1.034) for ischemic heart disease.

The grasses and the herb were more tolerant of O3 and grasses were the most responsive to N. Significant interactions between factors indicated a loss of effectiveness of N in O3-polluted atmospheres and an ability of O3 to counterbalance the damage induced by N input, but both effects were dependent on O3 and N levels.

In this study, we collate O3 exposure-yield data for 49 soybean cultivars, from 28 experimental studies published between 1982 and 2014, to produce an updated dose-response function for soybean. Different cultivars were seen to vary considerably in their sensitivity to O3 , with estimated yield loss due to O3 ranging from 13.3% for the least sensitive cultivar to 37.9% for the most sensitive, at a 7-h mean O3 concentration (M7) of 55 ppb - a level frequently observed in regions of the USA, India and China in recent years. The year of cultivar release, country of data collection and type of O3 exposure used were all important explanatory variables in a multivariate regression model describing soybean yield response to O3 . The data show that the O3 sensitivity of soybean cultivars increased by an average of 32.5% between 1960 and 2000, suggesting that selective breeding strategies targeting high yield and high stomatal conductance may have inadvertently selected for greater O3 sensitivity over time.

It was found that O3 pollution didn't change the abundances of Type I and Type II methanotrophic bacteria at two rice stages. For methanogenic archaea, their abundances in both cultivars were decreased by O3 pollution at the tillering stage.

Exposure to ozone may affect the symbiotic relationship between plants and beneficial microorganisms. In particular, the herbivore resistance mechanism conferred by fungal endophytes (defensive mutualism) may be affected, as any of the ozone-triggered effects (such as elicitation of defence mechanisms against biotrophic fungi or oxidative stress in the apoplastic space) may target the symbiont. Symbiotic and non-symbiotic Lolium multiflorum plants were exposed to ozone for two consecutive days (2h per day), after which half were infested with 10 aphids (Rhopalosiphum padi). We measured variables related to performance of plants, the endophyte symbiont (alkaloids) and the herbivores. Aphid populations were smaller on symbiotic plants than in non-symbiotic plants in low-ozone conditions. However, this difference disappeared in exposed plants to high-ozone conditions. Under low-ozone conditions, structure of aphid populations on endophyte-symbiotic plants was characterized by a low number of nymphs and a high number of adults. This pattern was not observed with high-ozone exposure. Level of fungal alkaloids (lolines) was not affected by either ozone or herbivory. Results indicate that ozone impairs the grass-endophyte symbiosis without affecting production of alkaloids generally linked with aphids' response to endophyte presence.

Herbivore-feeding induced the emission of several VOCs, while ozone alone had no significant effect.

In accordance, herbivore-damaged plants elicited more oriented flights than undamaged plants, whereas pla onts exposed to 120 ppb ozone and 24 hr of herbivore-feeding elicited moreriented flights than plants subjected to herbivore-feeding alone. Ozone enrichment of the wind-tunnel air appeared to negatively affect orientation of parasitoids at 70 ppb, but not at 120 ppb.

Light intensity and N content peaked in upper canopy layers, and sharply decreased through the lower canopy. Plant leaf area decreased with increasing [O3] allowing for greater light intensity to reach lower canopy levels. At the leaf level, light-saturated photosynthesis decreased and dark respiration increased with increasing [O3]. These data were used to calculate daily net canopy photosynthesis (Pc). Pc decreased with increasing [O3] with an average decrease of 10% for an increase in [O3] of 10 ppb, and which was similar to changes in above-ground dry mass production of the stands. Absolute daily net photosynthesis of lower layers was very low and thus the decrease in photosynthesis in the lower canopy caused by elevated [O3] had only minor significance for total canopy photosynthesis. Sensitivity analyses revealed that the decrease in Pc was associated with changes in leaf ecophysiology but not with decrease in leaf area.

Increased ovule abortion and precocious seed germination in the pods of O3-treated plants reduced mature seed number pod?1.

Measurements of stomatal conductance were used to parameterize ozone flux models for D. glomerata. For the first time, a modification was made to the standard flux model to account for the observed decrease in sensitivity of stomatal conductance to reduced water availability with increasing ozone. Comparison of calculated cumulative ozone flux between the two versions of the model demonstrated that exclusion of the ozone effect on stomatal conductance in the standard flux model led to a large underestimation of ozone fluxes at mid- to high-ozone concentrations. For example, at a mean ozone concentration of 55 ppb (as predicted for many temperate areas in the next few decades), the standard flux model underestimated ozone fluxes in D. glomerata by 3040% under reduced water availability. Although the modified flux model does not markedly change the flux-based critical level for D. glomerata, this study indicates that use of the standard flux model to quantify the risk of ozone damage to a widely distributed grassland species such as D. glomerata in areas where high ozone concentrations and reduced soil moisture coincide could lead to an underestimation of effects.

Elevated concentrations of carbon dioxide and tropospheric ozone pose important threats to the abundance, diversity, and composition of forest arthropod communities. In turn, modification of arthropod communities may alter forest health, productivity, and ecosystem services. 2. We studied the independent and interactive effects of elevated CO2 (eCO(2)) and elevated O-3 (eO(3)) on the abundance, species richness, and community composition of herbivorous arthropods in stands of trembling aspen and paper birch at the Aspen Free Air CO2 Enrichment (FACE) site in northern Wisconsin, USA. We conducted timed, visual surveys of canopy arthropods during each of the summers of 2005, 2006, and 2007. 3. We examined 26 983 arthropods on aspen and 8344 arthropods on birch across the fumigation treatments. Elevated CO2 and eO(3) had species-specific and temporally variable (i.e. idiosyncratic) effects on aspen and birch arthropod abundance and species richness. Weak, idiosyncratic effects of eCO(2) and eO(3) on herbivorous arthropod abundance and species richness did not significantly alter aspen arthropod community composition but occasionally altered birch insect community composition. Few interactive effects of CO2 and O-3 were observed. 4. Growing evidence suggests that the effects of eCO(2) and eO(3) on communities of insects are difficult to predict because responses are generally weak and species-and time-specific. Although studies to date suggest that impacts of future atmospheres on insect community metrics are likely to be minimal, the possibility remains that effects on particularly important or susceptible species may cascade to alter trophic interactions and, ultimately, ecosystem processes.",0,0,8.6.2,Population- and Community Level Responses

Parameterization of the model was carried out by in-situ measurements in a free-air ozone exposure experiment. The model performed fairly well under ambient conditions, with low ozone concentration. However, the model overestimated stomatal conductance under enhanced ozone condition due to ozone-induced stomatal closure. A revised model that included a parameter representing ozone-induced stomatal closure showed better estimation of ozone uptake. Neglecting ozone-induced stomatal closure induced a 20 % overestimation of the stomatal uptake of ozone. The ozone-induced stomatal closure was closely related to stomatal ozone uptake rather than accumulated concentrations of ozone exceeding 40 nmol mol??.

However, the biological effects of ozone encompass changes in reactive oxygen species signalling, oxidative stress accumulation, and the immune response of both plants and animals. The main objective of this work was to evaluate the direct effect of ozone on Metopolophium dirhodum (Walker) aphids (Hemiptera: Aphididae), linking mechanisms that operate at individual scale (oxidative stress parameters and aphid?bacteria symbiosis persistence) with their consequences at population scale (mortality, dispersion, and population growth). Two experiments were conducted in open?top chambers with three contrasting ozone exposure regimes (6 h at 0.5 ? 0.3, 50 ? 5, or 150 ? 10 p.p.b.) and artificial diets to evaluate the direct effect of ozone on aphids. Exposure of aphids to ozone increased insect mortality compared to the control treatment. However, the populations established from the surviving insects of each treatment increased similarly. Consistently, aphid symbiosis with Buchnera aphidicola Munson et al. (Proteobacteria) and Hamiltonella defensa Moran et al. (Enterobacteriaceae) persisted in all treatments. Ozone also affected aphid behaviour. The proportion of insects dispersing from diet cages was lower in the ozone treatments than in the control treatment. In addition, lipid peroxidation was higher at 150 p.p.b. than at 50 p.p.b. treatment, although not different from that in the control. The reduction in aphid dispersion coupled with increased mortality suggests that direct exposure to ozone could lower aphid efficiency as virus vectors. These results could be partially associated with mechanisms operating at individual scale (accumulation of oxidative damage). Overall, these experiments encourage reconsidering the impact of the direct effects of ozone on aphids when assessing the consequences of this component of global change on plant?aphid interactions.",0,0,8.6.1,Individual Level Responses

Following subacute ozone exposure (0.3 ppm for 24-72 h), neutrophilic inflammation and IL-6 are augmented in adiponectin-deficient (Adipo(-/-)) mice. The IL-17/granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) axis is required for this increased neutrophilia. We hypothesized that elevated IL-6 in Adipo(-/-) mice contributes to their augmented responses to ozone via effects on IL-17A expression. Therefore, we generated mice deficient in both adiponectin and IL-6 (Adipo(-/-)/IL-6(-/-)) and exposed them to ozone or air. In ozone-exposed mice, bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) neutrophils, IL-6, and G-CSF, and pulmonary Il17a mRNA expression were greater in Adipo(-/-) vs. wild-type mice, but reduced in Adipo(-/-)/IL-6(-/-) vs. Adipo(-/-) mice.

In wild-type mice, IL-6 was expressed in Gr-1(+)F4/80(-)CD11c(-) cells, whereas in Adipo(-/-) mice F4/80(+)CD11c(+) cells also expressed IL-6, suggesting that IL-6 is regulated by adiponectin in these alveolar macrophages. Transcriptomic analysis identified serum amyloid A3 (Saa3), which promotes IL-17A expression, as the gene most differentially augmented by ozone in Adipo(-/-) vs. wild-type mice. After ozone, Saa3 mRNA expression was markedly greater in Adipo(-/-) vs. wild-type mice but reduced in Adipo(-/-)/IL-6(-/-) vs. Adipo(-/-) mice.

The O? level and whitefly herbivory significantly increased the total amount of volatile organic compounds (VOCs), monoterpenes, green leaf volatiles (GLVs), and aldehyde volatiles produced by tomato plants. The 35S plants released higher amount of total VOCs and monoterpene volatiles than Wt plants under O?+herbivory treatments.

Therefore, this study examines the seasonal ozone impact on stomatal resistance, surface energy balance, boundary layer dynamics, and CO2 assimilation at this (sub)diurnal scale under changing conditions. We combine a seasonal canopy resistance module with a surface-boundary layer model that solves the diurnal evolution of dynamical and chemical variables in a well-mixed, convective boundary layer. The model is constrained with observations from Cabauw (Netherlands) for the dry year 2003, representing a well-mixed boundary layer at midlatitudes over water-stressed grassland. To quantify the ozone impact, the Cumulative Uptake of Ozone is calculated over a growing season, which gives an estimate of the reduction in stomatal aperture and photosynthesis. From a sensitivity analysis with mixed-layer temperature and soil moisture content we conclude that drought is the dominant factor that determines the surface energy partitioning and limits CO2 assimilation. Although drought causes stomatal closure, the results indicate that ozone damage, nevertheless, occurs. A second sensitivity analysis with CO2 and ozone shows that ozone damage causes an increase in stomatal resistance of up to 40% under high ozone levels and that CO2-induced stomatal closure limits ozone damage. The impact on boundary layer development through the effect of CO2 and ozone on the stomatal resistance is much smaller. At the diurnal scale soil moisture influences the surface energy partitioning, which affects the entrainment of ozone-rich air.

In contrast, anakinra had no effect on Il23a or Il17a pulmonary mRNA abundance or on BAL concentrations of the neutrophil survival factor G-CSF, but anakinra did reduce BAL neutrophil numbers, likely because anakinra also reduced BAL IL-6.

Endophyte symbiotic and endophyte free Lolium multiflorum plants were exposed to high ozone concentration at pre-anthesis. Seed production of symbiotic plants was 23% higher than that of endophyte free plants, being positively correlated with number of spikes and independent of ozone. Seed viability was negatively affected by the endophyte and improved by ozone. A dramatic negative effect of ozone on endophyte viability was manifested only after 25-day seed storage under accelerating ageing conditions. On average, seeds from plants exposed to ozone had higher levels of reduced glutathione (GSH), whilst seeds from symbiotic plants were associated with higher content of glutathione disulfide (GSSG). Consistent with the pattern of seed viability dynamics, the glutathione half-cell reduction potential (EGSSG/2GSH) was higher (i.e. less negative) in E+ seeds and slightly lower (i.e. more negative) in seeds from plants exposed to high ozone. The relationship between endophyte symbiosis and ozone stress with the levels of tocochromanol antioxidants was unclear, and irrespective of seed or endophyte viability. The concentration of some tocochromanols were not affected, whereas others were positively (?-tocopherol) or negatively (?-tocotrienol and ?-tocopherol) affected by the endophyte, or positively affected (?-tocopherol) by ozone alone.

Chronic exposure to low doses of ozone similar to the levels during a day of high pollution in Mexico City causes a state of oxidative stress that elicits progressive neurodegeneration in the hippocampi of rats.

UV-B radiation significantly increased the abundance of total nematodes and bacterivores in comparison with the control at pod-filling stage of soybean. Following elevated O3, nematode diversity index decreased and dominance index increased relative to the control at pod-filling stage of soybean. Nematode functional diversity showed response to the effects of elevated O3 and UV-B radiation at pod-bearing stage. Higher enrichment index and lower structure index in the treatment with both elevated O3 and UV-B radiation indicated a stressed soil condition and degraded soil food web. However, the ratios of nematode trophic groups suggested that the negative effects of elevated O3 on soil food web may be weakened by the UV-B radiations.",0,0,8.1.3,Consumer Communities

Increases below about 3km cause a positive FPR; increases above cause a negative FPR. The FPR due to stratospheric ozone change is, per unit RF, about 3 times larger than that due to tropospheric ozone. As historical ozone trends in the troposphere and stratosphere are opposite in sign, so too are the FPRs.

We assigned individual voles to receive plants from only one FACE ring and recorded plant consumption and weanling body mass for seven days. Elevated CO2 and O3 altered the foliar chemistry of both forbs, but only female weanling voles on the O3 diet showed negative responses to these changes. Elevated CO2 increased the fiber fractions of both plant species, whereas O3 fumigation elicited strong responses among many phytochemical components, most notably increasing the carbon-to-nitrogen ratio by 40% and decreasing N by 26%. Consumption did not differ between plant species or among fumigation treatments.

PUR118, a calcium salt based formulation engineered in the iSPERSE(TM) dry powder delivery technology, is a novel anti-inflammatory drug for COPD. Here we evaluated the efficacy and safety of three doses of PUR118 in attenuating ozone-induced airway inflammation in healthy volunteers.<br /><br /><strong>METHODS: </strong>In a single-blind, phase 1B proof of concept study, 24 subjects were enrolled to sequentially receive three doses of PUR118 (5.5 mg, n = 18; 11.0 mg, n = 18; 2.8 mg, n = 16). Each dose was inhaled 3 times (1, 13, 25 h, preceded by 2 puffs salbutamol) before the ozone exposure (250 ppb, 3 h intermittent exercise). Sputum was induced 3 h after the end of exposure.<br /><br /><strong>RESULTS: </strong>Sputum neutrophils, sputum CD14+ cells, as well as concentrations of IL1B, IL6, IL8, MMP9, and TNFA in sputum supernatant significantly increased after ozone exposure (n = 24). The percentage of sputum neutrophils (n = 12 who completed all treatments) did not change following treatment with different doses of PUR118. The high dose treatment group (n = 16) showed a decrease in the percentage and number of sputum macrophages (p ? 0.05) as well as a decrease in blood neutrophils (p = 0.04), and an increase in blood CD14?+ cells (p = 0.04) compared to baseline. All dosages of PUR118 were safe and well tolerated.<br /><br /><strong>CONCLUSION: </strong>Ozone challenge resulted in the expected and significant increase of sputum inflammatory parameters.

A broad literature base provides evidence of association between air pollution and paediatric asthma. Socioeconomic status (SES) may modify these associations; however, previous studies have found inconsistent evidence regarding the role of SES.

METHODS:
Effect modification of air pollution-paediatric asthma morbidity by multiple indicators of neighbourhood SES was examined in Atlanta, Georgia. Emergency department (ED) visit data were obtained for 5-18?years old with a diagnosis of asthma in 20-county Atlanta during 2002-2008. Daily ZIP Code Tabulation Area (ZCTA)-level concentrations of ozone, nitrogen dioxide, fine particulate matter and elemental carbon were estimated using ambient monitoring data and emissions-based chemical transport model simulations. Pollutant-asthma associations were estimated using a case-crossover approach, controlling for temporal trends and meteorology. Effect modification by ZCTA-level (neighbourhood) SES was examined via stratification.

RESULTS:
We observed stronger air pollution-paediatric asthma associations in 'deprivation areas' (eg, ?20% of the ZCTA population living in poverty) compared with 'non-deprivation areas'. When stratifying analyses by quartiles of neighbourhood SES, ORs indicated stronger associations in the highest and lowest SES quartiles and weaker associations among the middle quartiles.

CONCLUSIONS:
Our results suggest that neighbourhood-level SES is a factor contributing vulnerability to air pollution-related paediatric asthma morbidity in Atlanta. Children living in low SES environments appear to be especially vulnerable given positive ORs and high underlying asthma ED rates. Inconsistent findings of effect modification among previous studies may be partially explained by choice of SES stratification criteria, and the use of multiplicative models combined with differing baseline risk across SES populations.",0,0,3.1.5.2,Emergency Department (ED) Visits

The groups received one of the following treatments: (1) Control (air); (2) Ozone (O3) 7 days; (3) O3 15 days; (4) O3 30 days; (5) O3 60 days; and (6) O3 90 days. Two hours after each treatment, the animals were sacrificed and the hippocampus was extracted. Afterwards, the tissue was processed for western blot and immunohistochemistry using the following antibodies: ATF6, 78 kDa glucose-regulated protein (GRP78) and caspase 12. It was also subjected to terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) assay and electronic microscopy. Our results show an increase in ATF6, GRP78 and caspase 12 as well as ER ultrastructural alterations and an increase of TUNEL positive cells after 60 and 90 days of exposure to ozone. With the obtained results, we can conclude that oxidative stress induced by chronic exposure to low doses of ozone leads to ER stress. ER stress activates ATF6 inducing the increase of GRP78 in the cytoplasm, which leads to the increase in the nuclear translocation of ATF6. Finally, the translocation creates a vicious cycle that, together with the activation of the cascade for apoptotic cell death, contributes to the maintenance of ER stress. These events potentially contribute in the neurodegeneration processes in diseases like AD.",0,0,7.2.2.3.1,Toxicological Studies

This study sought to analyse whether urban risk factors such as traffic noise, pollutants and heat waves might have a short-term impact on exacerbation of symptoms of dementia, leading to emergency hospital admission.<br /><br /><strong>MATERIAL AND METHODS: </strong>We conducted a longitudinal ecological time-series study, with the dependent variable being the number of daily dementia-related emergency (DDE) hospital admissions to Madrid municipal hospitals (ICD-10 codes 290.0-290.2, 290.4-290.9, 294.1-294) from 01 to 01-2001 to 31-12-2009, as obtained from the Hospital Morbidity Survey (National Statistics Institute). The measures used were as follows: for noise pollution, Leqd, equivalent diurnal noise level (from 8 to 22h), and Leqn, equivalent nocturnal noise level (from 22 to 8h) in dB(A); for chemical pollution, mean daily NO2, PM2.5, PM1 as provided by the Madrid Municipal Air Quality Monitoring Grid; and lastly, maximum daily temperature (?C), as supplied by the State Meteorological Agency. Scatterplot diagrams were plotted to assess the type of functional relationship existing between the main variable of analysis and the environmental variables. The lags of the environmental variables were calculated to analyse the timing of the effect. Poisson regression models were fitted, controlling for trends and seasonalities, to quantify relative risk (RR).<br /><br /><strong>RESULTS: </strong>During the study period, there were 1175 DDE hospital admissions. These admissions displayed a linear functional relationship without a threshold in the case of Leqd. The RR of DDE admissions was 1.15 (1.11-1.20) for an increase of 1dB in Leqd, with impact at lag 0. In the case of maximum daily temperature, there was a threshold temperature of 34?C, with an increase of 1?C over this threshold posing an RR of 1.19 (1.09-1.30) at lag 1.

Atmospheric pollutants such as ozone (O3) can react with VOCs and affect the dynamics and fidelity of these interactions. However, the effects of atmospheric degradation of plant VOCs on plant-insect interactions remains understudied. We used a system comprising Brassica oleracea subsp. capitata (cabbage) and the specialist herbivore Plutella xylostella to test whether O3-triggered VOC degradation disturbs larval host orientation, and to investigate the underlying mechanisms. Larvae oriented towards both constitutive and larva-induced cabbage VOC blends, the latter being the more attractive. Such behaviour was, however, dramatically reduced in O3-polluted environments. Mechanistically, O3 rapidly degraded VOCs with the magnitude of degradation increasing with O3 levels. Furthermore, we used Teflon filters to collect VOCs and their reaction products, which were used as odour sources in behavioural tests. Larvae avoided filters exposed to O3-transformed VOCs and spent less time searching on them compared to filters exposed to original VOCs, which suggests that some degradation products may have repellent properties.

Because of their volatile nature, however, floral scents readily react with ozone, nitrate radical, and hydroxyl radical. The result of such reactions is the degradation and the chemical modification of scent plumes downwind of floral sources. Large Eddy Simulations (LES) are developed to investigate dispersion and chemical degradation and modification of floral scents due to reactions with ozone, hydroxyl radical, and nitrate radical within the atmospheric surface layer. Impacts on foraging insects are investigated by utilizing a random walk model to simulate insect search behavior. Results indicate that even moderate air pollutant levels (e.g., ozone mixing ratios greater than 60 parts per billion on a per volume basis, ppbv) substantially degrade floral volatiles and alter the chemical composition of released floral scents. As a result, insect success rates of locating plumes of floral scents were reduced and foraging times increased in polluted air masses due to considerable degradation and changes in the composition of floral scents. Results also indicate that plant-pollinator interactions could be sensitive to changes in floral scent composition, especially if insects are unable to adapt to the modified scentscape. The increase in foraging time could have severe cascading and pernicious impacts on the fitness of foraging insects by reducing the time devoted to other necessary tasks. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Mean numbers of eosinophils and neutrophils and levels of the neutrophil attractants C-X-C motif chemokines 2 [Cxcl2 (major intrinsic protein 2)] and 5 [Cxcl5 (limb expression, LIX)] in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid were significantly lower in Mbl(-/-) than Mbl(+/+) mice exposed to ozone. Using genome-wide mRNA microarray analyses, we identified significant differences in transcript response profiles and networks at baseline [e.g., nuclear factor erythroid-related factor 2 (NRF2)-mediated oxidative stress response] and after exposure (e.g., humoral immune response) between Mbl(+/+) and Mbl(-/-) mice. The microarray data were further analyzed to discover several informative differential response patterns and subsequent gene sets, including the antimicrobial response and the inflammatory response. We also used the lists of gene transcripts to search the LINCS L1000CDS(2) data sets to identify agents that are predicted to perturb ozone-induced changes in gene transcripts and inflammation. These novel findings demonstrate that targeted deletion of Mbl caused differential levels of inflammation-related gene sets at baseline and after exposure to ozone and significantly reduced pulmonary inflammation, thus indicating an important innate immunomodulatory role of the gene in this model.",0,0,3.1.4.4.2,Animal Toxicological Studies

These stress-mediated changes over time have been linked to insulin resistance. We hypothesized that acute ozone-induced stress response and metabolic impairment would persist during subchronic episodic exposure and induce peripheral insulin resistance. Male Wistar Kyoto rats were exposed to air or 0.25ppm or 1.00ppm ozone, 5h/day, 3 consecutive days/week (wk) for 13wks. Pulmonary, metabolic, insulin signaling and stress endpoints were determined immediately after 13wk or following a 1wk recovery period (13wk+1wk recovery). We show that episodic ozone exposure is associated with persistent pulmonary injury and inflammation, fasting hyperglycemia, glucose intolerance, as well as, elevated circulating adrenaline and cholesterol when measured at 13wk, however, these responses were largely reversible following a 1wk recovery. Moreover, the increases noted acutely after ozone exposure in non-esterified fatty acids and branched chain amino acid levels were not apparent following a subchronic exposure. Neither peripheral or tissue specific insulin resistance nor increased hepatic gluconeogenesis were present after subchronic ozone exposure. Instead, long-term ozone exposure lowered circulating insulin and severely impaired glucose-stimulated beta-cell insulin secretion. Thus, our findings in young-adult rats provide potential insights into epidemiological studies that show a positive association between ozone exposures and type 1 diabetes. Ozone-induced beta-cell dysfunction may secondarily contribute to other tissue-specific metabolic alterations following chronic exposure due to impaired regulation of glucose, lipid, and protein metabolism.",0,0,3.2.3,Biological Plausibility

Levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS), EGF, and transforming growth factor ? (TGF-?) in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) of mice were measured using ELISA. BALB/c mice were intratracheally instilled with the EGFR kinase inhibitor PD153035 2 h prior to O3 exposure and every other day thereafter. Phosphorylation of EGFR (Y1068) in lung sections was determined using immunohistochemical staining and western blot 24 h after exposure. Inhalation of O3 induced pronounced lung inflammation in a dose-dependent manner. Levels of ROS, TGF-?, and total proteins and cells in the BALF of mice exposed to 0.5 ppm or 1.0 ppm of O3 were markedly elevated relative to those in the BALF of the mice exposed to FA. In addition, exposure to O3 induced EGFR(Y1068) phosphorylation in the airway epithelium.

This task is particularly difficult for near-term climate forcers like aerosols, methane, and ozone precursors because their short atmospheric lifetimes cause regionally and temporally inhomogeneous radiative forcings. This study quantifies specific radiative forcing, defined as the radiative forcing per unit change in mass emitted, for eight near-term climate forcers as a function of their source regions and the season of emission by using dedicated simulations by four general circulation and chemistry-transport models. Although differences in the representation of atmospheric chemistry and radiative processes in different models impede the creation of a uniform dataset, four distinct findings can be highlighted. Firstly, specific radiative forcing for sulfur dioxide and organic carbon are stronger when aerosol-cloud interactions are taken into account. Secondly, there is a lack of agreement on the sign of the specific radiative forcing of volatile organic compound perturbations, suggesting they are better avoided in climate mitigation strategies. Thirdly, the strong seasonalities of the specific radiative forcing of most forcers allow strategies to minimise positive radiative forcing based on the timing of emissions. Finally, European and shipping emissions exert stronger aerosol specific radiative forcings compared to East Asia where the baseline is more polluted. This study can therefore form the basis for further refining climate mitigation options based on regional and seasonal controls on emissions. For example, reducing summertime emissions of black carbon and wintertime emissions of sulfur dioxide in the more polluted regions is a possible way to improve air quality without weakening the negative radiative forcing of aerosols.",0,0,9.2.1,Recent Evidence for Historical Period

Tropospheric air pollutants, such as ozone, can impair plant-plant interactions, e.g. by degrading volatile signals. In this study, field and laboratory experiments were conducted to assess whether plant-plant interactions between damaged and undamaged cabbage (Brassica oleracea var. capitata) plants provide receivers with a competitive advantage by altering their susceptibility to oviposition by the specialist herbivores Pieris brassicae and Plutella xylostella. We tested the phenomenon in oviposition choice tests under ambient and enriched ozone conditions. We also investigated the effect of receiving a signal from a different Brassica oleracea cultivar group, in this study broccoli (Brassica oleracea var italica), on the susceptibility to oviposition of cabbage plants. Cabbage plants exposed to damaged cabbage neighbors under ambient ozone were less susceptible to oviposition by P. brassicae in the field, but not in the laboratory. At ambient ozone levels P. xylostella preferred to oviposit on cabbage plants exposed to undamaged conspecifics in both the field and laboratory. At enriched ozone levels in the field, P. xylostella showed no oviposition preference for cabbage exposed to damaged or undamaged cabbage neighbors. In multiple choice tests in the laboratory, P. xylostella preferred to oviposit on cabbage plants exposed to damaged broccoli plants at ambient ozone over plants exposed to undamaged broccoli plants at ambient ozone and damaged and undamaged broccoli plants at enriched ozone.

Ozone impacts on stomata are still controversial, as both decreased stomatal conductance and slow stomatal responses to environmental stimuli (namely, stomatal sluggishness) have been shown. We postulated that the light environment affects stomatal sluggishness. To concurrently manipulate O-3 and light conditions and measure gas exchange at leaf level, we developed an innovative O-3 exposure system by modifying a commercially available gas exchange system. We exposed the first trifoliate leaf of the O-3-sensitive genotype S156 of snapbean (Phaseolus vulgaris) to a 1-h O-3 exposure (150 ppb) under 1000 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) photosynthetic photon flux density, so that stomata were fully open and O-3 uptake was maximized. Then, leaves were subjected to different light intensities (200, 1000, or 1500 mu mol m(-2) s(-1)) until a steady state was reached. As a metric of sluggishness, we quantified the stomatal responses to a sharp water stress generated by cutting the petiole at steady state. The results showed that O-3 exposure induced stomatal sluggishness only under high light (stomata needed 53 % more time to half stomatal conductance relative to steady state) and did not when the plants were under lower light intensities. We conclude that O-3-induced stomatal sluggishness may occur only in fully irradiated leaves, and suggest it is a minor response when entire crowns and canopies are assessed and a major reason of the higher O-3 sensitivity of sun leaves than of shade leaves.",0,0,8.11.2,Impaired Stomatal Function

Many studies have shown that elevated ozone negatively impacts yields of important crops such as wheat or rice, but how ozone influences soil ecosystems of these crops and plant growth in rotation systems is less well understood. Using soil collected from a free-air ozone enrichment experiment running for 5 years, we carried out a plant-soil feedback experiment under greenhouse conditions to evaluate the influence of wheat cultivars (Triticum aestivum L.) with different ozone-tolerance on rice (Oryza sativa L.) grown in soils with or without a history of ozone exposure. Our results indicate that there were interactive effects of wheat cultivar and history of ozone exposure on soil respiration and the abundance of fungivorous nematodes. Moreover, the soil microbial community and the abundance of omnivorours-predatory nematodes varied in different wheat cultivars. These differences in the soil, in turn, had feedback effects on the succeeding growth of rice. Rice grown in soil in which previously the ozone-sensitive wheat cultivars Yangmai 2 or Yangmai 19 had grown, had lower shoot biomass than rice grown in the ozone tolerant wheat cultivars Yangmai 16 soil. However, these cultivar specific effects on rice growth were independent from the previous ozone exposure of the soil. Our results suggest that, in rice-wheat rotation systems, when selecting wheat cultivars to cope with changing climatic conditions, such as elevated ozone, growers should consider the soil-feedback effects of these cultivars on the succeeding crop.

Launched in 2001, the program has supported a number of studies aimed at evaluating whether regulatory and other actions taken to improve air quality have resulted in the intended improvements in air quality, population exposures, and health outcomes. Gilliland and colleagues? study addressed a critical issue: assessment of the effects of regulatory actions taken at both a national and a regional level that have been implemented over multiple years.

The investigators built on their earlier work in the Children?s Health Study (CHS), which has for more than 20 years been evaluating associations between levels of several major outdoor pollutants and the respiratory health of children who live in Southern California. The CHS has shown that long term exposure of children to elevated levels of outdoor air pollution has adverse effects on the development of their lung function and that exposure to outdoor pollution in Southern California was associated with increased symptoms of airway disease in children.

Over the course of the CHS, the United States Environmental Protection Agency and regional agencies (including the California Air Resources Board) put in place many different regulations intended to curb emissions and reduce pollutant levels, and the levels of many outdoor pollutants have decreased in Southern California over the time period. Thus, the first goal of the current study was to identify the major air quality regulations for mobile, stationary, and area source emissions, enforced both nationally and in California over the 20 years between 1993 and 2012, and link them to improvements in air quality in Southern California communities. The second goal was to explore associations between the decreases in long-term levels of major outdoor pollutants and improvements in children?s respiratory health over the same time period.

The focus of the respiratory health aspects of the current study were lung growth and symptoms of respiratory conditions: the investigators assessed how the observed decreases in pollutant levels affected the development of lungs in children during their teenage years, a crucial period for lung development. After the teenage years, there is little growth in lung size or capacity, and lung size at age 18 is a predictor of respiratory and cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in later life. The investigators also asked how the long-term changes in pollutant levels affected symptoms of respiratory conditions in children between ages 9 and 18. Outdoor pollutants affect children with asthma more than children without asthma, and the incidence of asthma has grown over the last several decades.",0,0,3.2.4.2.1,Epidemiologic Studies

Following ozone exposure, increased numbers of pro-inflammatory CD11b?(+)?Ly6C(Hi) and anti-inflammatory CD11b?(+)?Ly6C(Lo) monocytes were observed in spleens of control (CTL) mice.

This was accompanied by increased lung expression of proteins involved in monocyte/macrophage trafficking including CCL3, CCL4, CCR1, and AT1R. Splenectomy resulted in decreases in pro-inflammatory macrophages in the lung and down regulation of CCR2, CCL2, and CCL4, but increases in CD11b?(+)?Ly6C(Lo) anti-inflammatory macrophages. CD11b(+)Ly6G(+)Ly6C(+) granulocytic (G)- and monocytic (M)-myeloid derived suppressor cells (MDSC)s were also detected in the lungs and spleens of CTL mice; these increased after ozone exposure. Splenectomy was associated with a decrease in G-MDSCs in the lung, with no effect on M-MDSCs. Changes in lung macrophage subpopulations and MDSCs in SPX mice were correlated with reduced ozone toxicity, as measured by decreases in bronchoalveolar lavage protein content and reduced 4-hydroxynonenal expression in the lung.

However, evidence is limited for air-pollution levels below the most recent National Ambient Air Quality Standards. Previous studies involved predominantly urban populations and did not have the statistical power to estimate the health effects in underrepresented groups. Methods We constructed an open cohort of all Medicare beneficiaries (60,925,443 persons) in the continental United States from the years 2000 through 2012, with 460,310,521 person-years of follow-up. Annual averages of fine particulate matter (particles with a mass median aerodynamic diameter of less than 2.5 ?m [PM2.5]) and ozone were estimated according to the ZIP Code of residence for each enrollee with the use of previously validated prediction models. We estimated the risk of death associated with exposure to increases of 10 ?g per cubic meter for PM2.5 and 10 parts per billion (ppb) for ozone using a two-pollutant Cox proportional-hazards model that controlled for demographic characteristics, Medicaid eligibility, and area-level covariates. Results Increases of 10 ?g per cubic meter in PM2.5 and of 10 ppb in ozone were associated with increases in all-cause mortality of 7.3% (95% confidence interval [CI], 7.1 to 7.5) and 1.1% (95% CI, 1.0 to 1.2), respectively. When the analysis was restricted to person-years with exposure to PM2.5 of less than 12 ?g per cubic meter and ozone of less than 50 ppb, the same increases in PM2.5 and ozone were associated with increases in the risk of death of 13.6% (95% CI, 13.1 to 14.1) and 1.0% (95% CI, 0.9 to 1.1), respectively. For PM2.5, the risk of death among men, blacks, and people with Medicaid eligibility was higher than that in the rest of the population. Conclusions In the entire Medicare population, there was significant evidence of adverse effects related to exposure to PM2.5 and ozone at concentrations below current national standards. This effect was most pronounced among self-identified racial minorities and people with low income.

Emissions of ozone precursors may result in elevated ozone concentrations nearby or downwind. Chronic exposure of sensitive vegetation to tropospheric ozone reduces its potential productivity. To evaluate the cobenefits of the Clean Power Plan to sensitive vegetation, we estimate ozone concentrations in the continental U.S. in 2020 with a chemical transport model in accordance with reference and alternative Clean Power Plan policy scenarios, which represent a range of possible approaches to reducing carbon dioxide emissions from power plants. The reductions in biomass, or the potential productivity losses, due to the exposure of 4 crops and 11 tree species to ozone are as large as 1.9% and 32%, respectively, in the reference scenario.

The mechanism by which O3-derived oxysterols affect molecular function is unknown. Our data show that in vitro exposure of human bronchial epithelial cells to O3 results in the formation of oxysterols, epoxycholesterol-? and -? and secosterol A and B (Seco A and Seco B), in cell lysates and apical washes. Similarly, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid obtained from human volunteers exposed to O3 contained elevated levels of these oxysterol species. As expected, O3-derived oxysterols have a pro-inflammatory effect and increase NF-?B activity. Interestingly, expression of the cholesterol efflux pump ATP-binding cassette transporter 1 (ABCA1), which is regulated by activation of the liver X receptor (LXR), was suppressed in epithelial cells exposed to O3 Additionally, exposure of LXR knock-out mice to O3 enhanced pro-inflammatory cytokine production in the lung, suggesting LXR inhibits O3-induced inflammation. Using alkynyl surrogates of O3-derived oxysterols, our data demonstrate adduction of LXR with Seco A. Similarly, supplementation of epithelial cells with alkynyl-tagged cholesterol followed by O3 exposure causes observable lipid-LXR adduct formation. Experiments using Seco A and the LXR agonist T0901317 (T09) showed reduced expression of ABCA1 as compared with stimulation with T0901317 alone, indicating that Seco A-LXR protein adduct formation inhibits LXR activation by traditional agonists. Overall, these data demonstrate that O3-derived oxysterols have pro-inflammatory functions and form lipid-protein adducts with LXR, thus leading to suppressed cholesterol regulatory gene expression and providing a biochemical mechanism mediating O3-derived formation of oxidized lipids in the airways and subsequent adverse health effects.",0,0,3.3.1,Short Term Exposure

Our previous study indicated catenin alpha-like 1 (CTNNAL1), an alpha-catenin-related protein, was downregulated in asthma patients and animal model. In this study, we observed that the expression of CTNNAL1 was increased in lung tissue of the ozone-stressed Balb/c mice model and in acute ozone stressed human bronchial epithelial cells (HBEC). In order to identify the possible DNA-binding proteins regulating the transcription of CTNNAL1 gene in HBEC, we designed 8 oligo- nucleotide probes corresponding to various regions of the CTNNAL1 promoter in electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA). We detected 5 putative transcription factors binding sites within CTNNAL1 promoter region that can recruit LEF-1, AP-2? and CREB respectively by EMSA and antibody supershift assay. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay verified that AP-2 ? and LEF-1 could be recruited to the CTNNAL1 promoter. Therefore we further analyzed the functions of putative AP-2 and LEF-1 sites within CTNNAL1 promoter by site-directed mutagenesis of those sites within pGL3/FR/luc. We observed a reduction in human CTNNAL1 promoter activity of mutants of both AP-2? and LEF-1 sites. Pre-treatment with ASOs targeting LEF-1and AP-2? yielded significant reduction of ozone-stress-induced CTNNAL1 expression. The activation of AP-2? and LEF-1, followed by CTNNAL1 expression, showed a correlation during a 16-hour time course. Our data suggest that a robust transcriptional CTNNAL1 up-regulation occurs during acute ozone-induced stress and is mediated at least in part by ozone-induced recruitments of LEF-1 and AP-2? to the human CTNNAL1 promoter.",0,0,3.1.4.4.2,Animal Toxicological Studies

In this study the contributions of copy number variation, exposure to air pollutants, and the interaction between the two on autism risk, were evaluated in the population-based case-control Childhood Autism Risks from Genetics and Environment (CHARGE) Study. For the current investigation, we included only those CHARGE children (a) who met criteria for autism or typical development and (b) for whom our team had conducted both genetic evaluation of copy number burden and determination of environmental air pollution exposures based on mapping addresses from the pregnancy and early childhood. This sample consisted of 158 cases of children with autism and 147 controls with typical development. Multiple logistic regression models were fit with and without environmental variable-copy number burden interactions. We found no correlation between average air pollution exposure from conception to age 2 years and the child's CNV burden. We found a significant interaction in which a 1SD increase in duplication burden combined with a 1SD increase in ozone exposure was associated with an elevated autism risk (OR 3.4, P?&lt;?0.005) much greater than the increased risks associated with either genomic duplication (OR 1.85, 95% CI 1.25-2.73) or ozone (OR 1.20, 95% CI 0.93-1.54) alone. Similar results were obtained when CNV and ozone were dichotomized to compare those in the top quartile relative to those having a smaller CNV burden and lower exposure to ozone, and when exposures were assessed separately for pregnancy, the first year of life, and the second year of life. No interactions were observed for other air pollutants, even those that demonstrated main effects; ozone tends to be negatively correlated with the other pollutants examined. While earlier work has demonstrated interactions between the presence of a pathogenic CNV and an environmental exposure [Webb et al., 2016], these findings appear to be the first indication that global copy number variation may increase susceptibility to certain environmental factors, and underscore the need to consider both genomics and environmental exposures as well as the mechanisms by which each may amplify the risks for autism associated with the other.

In spite of recent developments in ozone exposure metrics, from a concentration-based to a more physiologically relevant stomatal flux-based index, large scale ozone risk assessment is still complicated by a large and unexplained variation in ozone sensitivity among tree species. Here we explored whether the variation in ozone sensitivity among woody species can be linked to interspecific variation in leaf morphology. We found that ozone tolerance at the leaf level was closely linked to leaf dry mass per unit leaf area (LMA) and that whole-tree biomass reductions were more strongly related to stomatal flux per unit leaf mass (r(2) = 0.56) than to stomatal flux per unit leaf area (r(2) = 0.42). Furthermore, the interspecific variation in slopes of ozone flux-response relationships was considerably lower when expressed on a leaf mass basis (coefficient of variation, CV = 36%) than when expressed on a leaf area basis (CV = 66%), and relationships for broadleaf and needle-leaf species converged when using the mass-based index. These results show that much of the variation in ozone sensitivity among woody plants can be explained by interspecific variation in LMA and that large-scale ozone impact assessment could be greatly improved by considering this well-known and easily measured leaf trait.

However, little information exists regarding its effects on prehypertension, a very common, but understudied cardiovascular indicator. We evaluated data from 24,845 adults (ages 18-74 years) living in three Northeastern Chinese cities in 2009. Blood pressure (BP) was measured by trained observers using a standardized mercuric-column sphygmomanometer. Three-year (from 2006 to 2008) average concentrations of particles with an aerodynamic diameter ?10 ?m (PM10), sulfur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen dioxides (NO2), and ozone (O3) were calculated using data from monitoring stations. Effects were analyzed using generalized additive models and two-level regression analyses, controlling for covariates. We found positive associations of all pollutants with prehypertension (e.g. odds ratio (OR) was 1.17 (95% confidence interval (CI), 1.09-1.25) per interquartile range (IQR) of PM10) in a fully adjusted model, as compared to normotensive participants. These associations were stronger than associations with hypertension (e.g. OR was 1.03 (95% CI, 1.00, 1.07) per IQR of PM10). We have also found positive associations of all studied pollutants with systolic and diastolic BP: e.g., associations with PM10 per IQR were 1.24 mmHg (95% CI, 1.03-1.45) for systolic BP and 0.47 mmHg (95% CI, 0.33-0.61) for diastolic BP. Further, we observed that associations with BP were stronger in women and in older participants (systolic BP only). In conclusion, long-term exposure to ambient air pollution was more strongly associated with prehypertension than with hypertension, especially among females and the elderly. Thus, interventions to reduce air pollution are of great significance for preventing future cardiovascular events, particularly among individuals with prehypertension.",0,0,4.2.2,Biological Plausibility

Both obesity and ozone cause changes in systemic metabolism. Consequently, we examined the impact of ozone on the lung metabolomes of obese and lean mice. Lean wildtype and obese db/db mice were exposed to acute ozone (2 ppm for 3 h) or air. 24 hours later, the lungs were excised, flushed with PBS to remove blood and analyzed via liquid-chromatography or gas-chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry for metabolites. Both obesity and ozone caused changes in the lung metabolome. Of 321 compounds identified, 101 were significantly impacted by obesity in air-exposed mice. These included biochemicals related to carbohydrate and lipid metabolism, which were each increased in lungs of obese versus lean mice. These metabolite changes may be of functional importance given the signaling capacity of these moieties. Ozone differentially affected the lung metabolome in obese versus lean mice. For example, almost all phosphocholine-containing lysolipids were significantly reduced in lean mice, but this effect was attenuated in obese mice. Glutathione metabolism was also differentially affected by ozone in obese and lean mice. Finally, the lung metabolome indicated a role for the microbiome in the effects of both obesity and ozone: all measured bacterial/mammalian co-metabolites were significantly affected by obesity and/or ozone.

However, the findings from Asian populations are limited, and the question of critical windows of exposure remains unanswered. We examined whether maternal exposure to air pollutants, in particular exposure during the first trimester (an important period of placental development), was associated with foetal growth in Japanese term infants. From the Japan Perinatal Registry Network database, we received birth data for 29,177 term singleton births in western Japan (Kyushu-Okinawa Districts) between 2005 and 2010. Exposure was expressed in terms of average concentrations of air pollutants (ozone, suspended particulate matter, nitrogen dioxide, and sulphur dioxide), as measured at the nearest monitoring stations to the respective delivery hospitals of the pregnant women, during the entire pregnancy and each trimester. As proxy markers of foetal growth restriction, we used small for gestational age (SGA), and adverse birth weight (low birth weight in addition to SGA). For pollutant exposure during the entire pregnancy, we did not observe the association with SGA and adverse birth weight. In the single-trimester model for the first trimester, however, we found a positive association between ozone exposure, and SGA (odds ratio [OR] per 10 ppb increase = 1.07, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.01-1.12) and adverse birth weight (OR = 1.07; 95% CI = 1.01-1.14). This association persisted in the multi-trimester model, and no association for exposure during the second or third trimester was observed.

We investigated the physiological and biomass responses of an O3 sensitive hybrid poplar clone ('546') under three O3 levels (charcoal-filtered ambient air, non-filtered ambient air (NF), and NF plus 40 ppb) and two watering regimes (well-watered (WW) and reduced watering (RW), i.e. 40% irrigation) for one growing season. Water stress increased chlorophyll and carotenoid contents, protecting leaves from pigment degradation by O3. Impairment of photosynthesis by O3 was also reduced by stomatal closure due to water stress, which preserved light-saturated CO2 assimilation rate, and the maximum carboxylation efficiency. Water stress increased water use efficiency of the leaves while O3 decreased it, showing significant interactions. Effects were more evident in older leaves than in younger leaves. Water stress reduced biomass production, but the negative effects of O3 were less in RW than in WW for total biomass per plant. A stomatal O3 flux-based dose-response relationship was parameterized considering water stress effects, which explained biomass losses much better than a concentration-based approach. The O3 critical level of Phytotoxic Ozone Dose over a threshold of 7 nmol O3.m(-2).s(-1) (POD7) for a 4% biomass loss in this poplar clone under different water regimes was 4.1 mmol m(-2).

After three weeks of continuous sawfly feeding, herbivory stress increased systemic emissions of total non-oxygenated monoterpenes 5.6-fold, total sesquiterpenes 5.6-fold and total green leaf volatiles 6.5-fold from the non-damaged branch of larvae-fed seedlings, and this effect on total non-oxygenated monoterpene emission was enhanced 8.6-fold with elevated ozone. Herbivory sporadically showed post-feeding effects still by the end of 12th week from the initiation of feeding, increasing total non-oxygenated monoterpene emissions 4.4-fold at elevated nitrogen level. Our results suggest that Scots pine, at least in seedling stage, will be a stronger source of BVOC emissions in future due to expected increase of sawfly outbreaks with climate warming and by increased herbivory interactions with abiotic climate change factors.",0,0,8.7.1,Emission and Chemical Composition of Volatile Plant Signaling Compounds (VPSCs)

However, currently hardly anything is known whether this air pollutant can also pose a threat to the overall biodiversity in terrestrial ecosystems. Identifying the relative ozone sensitivities of relevant taxa or species can be a first step in an assessment if biodiversity is at risk from ozone. A literature survey was conducted describing experimental and observational results of exposure of organisms and particularly plant species to ozone at environmentally relevant concentrations. For plants ozone effects considered were vegetative growth (e.g. biomass of shoots, foliage, single leaves, stems, and roots), reproduction (number and biomass of seeds and flowers), species development, and symptoms of visible foliar injury. A total of 474 literature references were evaluated which described such effects. For crop plants 54 species with 350 varieties could be considered, while (semi) natural vegetation was represented by 465 vascular plant species comprising 298 herbaceous and 165 woody plant species. Overall, these ozone studies cover only a small fraction of the entire global flora. About two third of woody and about one half of native herbaceous plant species investigated so far have been described as ozone sensitive in at least one study. Ozone sensitivity is slightly higher with respect to visible leaf injury as compared to growth effects, and herbs and deciduous tree species are more responsive than grasses and coniferous trees. Observational results from field surveys conducted along ozone gradients to assess ecosystem effects of ozone in North America and Europe revealed visible macroscopic leaf injuries for 258 herbaceous species. However, these findings often have not been verified under experimental ozone exposure. Albeit the numbers of ozone studies related to a particular plant family varied considerably, high proportions of ozone sensitive species were found e.g. for the families Myrtaceae, Salicaceae and Onograceae, while low proportions of ozone sensitive species were found e.g. for the families Brassicaceae, Boraginaceae and Plantaginaceae. Intra-specific variations of ozone sensitivity of vascular plants were primarily detected in crop species (e.g. wheat, soybean, snap bean, clover, rice), most often derived from screening studies of cultivars for their relative ozone sensitivity/tolerance to ozone. In some cases intra-specific variation of ozone sensitivity is also true for different populations of woody and herbaceous plant species, which often resulted from temporal or spatial differentiation of the relative ozone susceptibility. Therefore, there is some evidence that ozone pollution in the past has already affected plant selection and modified the genetic pool of ozone sensitive genotypes. Information on direct ozone effects on species other than vascular plants (e.g. ferns, mosses, fungi, algae, vertebrates) is very poor or irrelevant, i.e. ozone sensitivities for these taxa could not be described. This is also true for organisms like microbes, arthropods or insects which have not been tested so far for their responses to direct ambient ozone exposure. However, these organisms may be indirectly impaired by ozone via loss of vitality of the plant system to which they are associated.",0,0,8.2,Visible Foliar Injury and Biomonitoring

Olfactory signals, often in synergy with visual signals, mediate the interactions between plants and animals. However, urbanization and agricultural practices are both sources of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and reactive oxygen species (ROS) that have the potential to interfere with plant-animal communication and to disrupt mutualistic interactions. In this review, we explore how anthropogenic airborne pollutants may disrupt chemical information transfer between flowering plants and flower visitors.

2. The emission of anthropogenic volatile pollutants (AVPs) including VOCs and formation of ROS, for example from traffic or industries, and non-natural biogenic VOCs, for example from introduced crops, may have a number of effects: (i) changes in plant signalling as a consequence of plants experiencing physiological stress; (ii) chemical interference (chemical degradation/transformation of infochemicals); (iii) increased levels of background noise impeding signal detection; and (iv) changes in pollinator signal perception and behaviour. All of the above in turn could have consequences for the biological fitness of plants and animals that rely on olfactory information as pivotal functional signals.

3. The study of anthropogenic airborne pollutants and their effects on plant signalling is just emerging and the impacts of this aspect of anthropogenic emissions are barely understood. Volatiles emitted from anthropogenically changed landscapes could, however, have far-reaching consequences for ecosystem functioning in adjacent natural zones, particularly in fragmented landscapes. In response to the wide gap in our knowledge on the mechanisms that govern interference of anthropogenic VOCs with olfactory information, future research directions are proposed with the aim to inspire research to help elucidate the risks of anthropogenic VOCs for plant-pollinator communities and improve risk assessment strategies.",0,0,8.7.1,Emission and Chemical Composition of Volatile Plant Signaling Compounds (VPSCs)

The effect of heat waves was investigated using negative binomial regression in a generalized additive model. We used a linear model on a logarithmic scale, having 1-day lagged temperature differences from the long-term average, 1-day lagged ambient O-3 and PM10 concentration, relative humidity, simple ""heat wave"" indicator, and smooth seasonal effect as explanatory variables. We found a small increase in daily mortality for the examined period. This increase can be attributed to PM10 concentrations in most cases, and in fewer instances, to air temperature and O-3 concentrations. The ""heat wave"" indicator did not significantly increase the relative risk; the same held for the relative humidity. For the general unstratified population, the highest increase in relative risk of 1.072 (95% CI 1.001-1.147) was observed for cardiovascular mortality and was associated with an increase in temperature of 10 A degrees C, followed by an increase in relative risk of 1.056 (95% CI 1.025-1.087) for respiratory mortality associated with an increase in O-3 concentrations by 10 mu g.m(-3). A higher risk in most cases was found for women. A significant increase of relative risk of 1.013 (95 % CI 1.002-1.024) due to PM10 was found for hospital admissions for cardiovascular causes. This issue should be studied further in view of the anticipated increase in meteorological extremes, including heat waves, in the future, to prepare prevention plans for eliminating their negative effects as far as possible.",0,0,4.3.1,Short Term Ozone Exposure

Simulation of tropospheric ozone has been a major focus of the GEOS-Chem chemical transport model (CTM) over the past 20 years, and many developments over the years have affected the model representation of the ozone budget. Here we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of the standard version of GEOS-Chem (v10-01) with ozone observations from ozonesondes, the OMI satellite instrument, and MOZAIC-IAGOS commercial aircraft for 2012-2013. Global validation of the OMI 700-400 hPa data with ozonesondes shows that OMI maintained persistent high quality and no significant drift over the 2006-2013 period. GEOS-Chem shows no significant seasonal or latitudinal bias relative to OMI and strong correlations in all seasons on the 2 degrees x 2.5 degrees horizontal scale (r = 0.88-0.95), improving on previous model versions. The most pronounced model bias revealed by ozonesondes and MOZAIC-IAGOS is at high northern latitudes in winter-spring where the model is 10-20 ppbv too low. This appears to be due to insufficient stratosphere-troposphere exchange (STE). Model updates to lightning NOx, Asian anthropogenic emissions, bromine chemistry, isoprene chemistry, and meteorological fields over the past decade have overall led to gradual increase in the simulated global tropospheric ozone burden and more active ozone production and loss. From simulations with different versions of GEOS meteorological fields we find that tropospheric ozone in GEOS-Chem v10-01 has a global production rate of 4960-5530 Tg a(-1), lifetime of 20.9-24.2 days, burden of 345-357 Tg, and STE of 325-492 Tg a(-1). Change in the intensity of tropical deep convection between these different meteorological fields is a major factor driving differences in the ozone budget. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

We examined the joint effects of gestational FA and air pollution exposures in association with ASD. We studied 346 ASD cases and 260 typically developing controls from the CHARGE case-control study. Self-reported FA intake for each month of pregnancy was quantified. Estimates of exposure to near roadway air pollution (NRP) and criteria air pollutant measures were assigned based on maternal residential history. Among mothers with high FA intake (>800 ?g) in the first pregnancy month, exposure to increasing levels of all air pollutants, except ozone, during the first trimester was associated with decreased ASD risk, while increased ASD risk was observed for the same pollutant among mothers with low FA intake (?800 ?g). This difference was statistically significant for NO2 (e.g., NO2 and low FA intake: OR?=?1.53 (0.91, 2.56) vs NO2 and high FA intake: OR?=?0.74 (0.46, 1.19), P-interaction?=?0.04). Mothers exposed to higher levels (? median) of any air pollutant during the first trimester of pregnancy and who reported low FA intake were at a higher ASD risk compared to mothers exposed to lower levels of that air pollutant and who reported high first month FA intake.

Then, we excluded subjects with PD, dementia, stroke and diabetes diagnosed before Jan. 1, 2000 and obtained 54,524 subjects to follow until Dec. 31, 2013. In this observational period, 1060 newly diagnosed PD cases were identified. 4240 controls were randomly selected from those without PD using a matching strategy for age, sex, the year of PD diagnosis and the year of entering the NHI program at a ratio of 1:4. Ten elements of air pollution were examined, and multiple logistic regression models were used to measure their risks in subsequent PD development.<br /><br /><strong>RESULTS: </strong>The incidence of PD in adults aged ? 40 years was 1.9%, and the median duration for disease onset was 8.45 years. None of the chemical compounds (SO2, O3, CO, NOx, NO, NO2, THC, CH4, or NMHC) significantly affected the incidence of PD except for particulate matter. PM10 exposure showed significant effects on the likelihood of PD development (T3 level: &gt; 65?g/m3 versus T1 level: ? 54?g/m3; OR = 1.35, 95% CI = 1.12-1.62, 0.001 ? P &lt; 0.01).

There are few studies about the association between breathing polluted air and adverse pregnancy outcomes in the Middle East. The aim of this study was to determine the relationship between air pollution and spontaneous abortion, premature birth, and stillbirth in Ahvaz. A time-series study was conducted. Data about spontaneous abortion, premature deliveries, and stillbirth was collected from Ahvaz Imam Khomeini Hospital. Air pollution data including NO, CO, NO2, PM10, SO2, O3, and climate data were, respectively, collected from the Environmental Protection Agency and the Khuzestan Province Meteorology Office from March 2008 until March 2015. The relationship between air pollutants with the number of abortions, premature births, and stillbirths was found using a quasi-Poisson distributed lag model, adjusted by trend, seasonality, temperature, relative humidity, weekdays, and holidays. The average daily dust in Ahvaz on 7.2% days of the year was higher than 500 ?g/m3 (very dangerous). Findings from this study indicate a significant association between each 10-unit increase in SO2 and spontaneous abortion in lag 0 and 9 days. There was a significant relation between each 10-unit increase in NO2 and CO, and premature birth in lag 0.

Volatiles emitted by a plant may trigger physiological responses in neighboring plants or adhere to their surfaces, which, in turn, may affect the responses of the neighboring plant to herbivory. These volatiles are subject to chemical reactions during transport in air currents, especially in a polluted atmosphere. We conducted a field experiment to test for the adsorption of dispenser-released myrcene on the surfaces of cabbage plants and the effects of distance from the dispenser and elevated ozone levels (1.4? ambient) on the process. We also tested the effects of the same treatments on oviposition on cabbage plants by naturally occurring Plutella xylostella. Under low ambient ozone conditions of central Finland, there was evidence for the adsorption and re-release of myrcene by cabbage plants growing at a distance of 50 cm from myrcene dispensers. This effect was absent at elevated ozone levels. The number of eggs deposited by P. xylostella was generally lower in plots under elevated ozone compared to ambient control plots. Our results indicate that passive adsorption and re-release of a volatile monoterpene can occur in nature; however, this process is dependent upon the distance between emitter source and receiver plants as well as the concentration of atmospheric pollutants in the air.

Two separate experiments using the same original soil seed bank were conducted. Plant and arthropod richness and species abundance was assessed during two years. We predicted that exposure to episodic high concentrations of ozone during a series of growing cycles would result in plant assemblies with lower diversity (lower species richness and higher dominance), due to an increase in dominance of the stress tolerant species and the elimination of the ozone-sensitive species. As a consequence, arthropod-plant interactions would also be changed. Species richness of the recruited plant communities from different exposure histories was similar (? 15).

Here we investigate the impacts of three levels of elevated exposure to tropospheric ozone on peatland microbial communities with a particular focus on testate amoebae, the dominant microbial consumers. We found that intermediate (ambient + 25 ppb O-3) and high ozone treatments (ambient +35 ppb summer, +10 ppb year round) led to significant changes in testate amoeba communities, typified by an increase in abundance of Phyrganella spp. and loss of diversity. Phyrganella is often suggested to feed on fungi so the observed community change in testate amoeba could be due to ozone-induced changes in the abundance of fungi or other microbial groups. We do not find evidence for changes in numbers of undifferentiated microalgae, nematodes or rotifers but do find weak evidence for an increase in flagellates and ciliates.

Previous studies of ozone and warming impacts on crops typically do not account for the strong ozone-temperature correlation when interpreting crop-ozone or crop-temperature relationships, or the spatial variability of crop-to-ozone sensitivity arising from varietal and environmental differences, leading to potential biases in their estimated crop losses. Here we develop an empirical model, called the partial derivative-linear regression (PDLR) model, to estimate the spatial variations in the sensitivities of wheat, maize and soybean yields to ozone exposures and temperature extremes in the US and Europe using a composite of multidecadal datasets, fully correcting for ozone temperature covariation. We find generally larger and more spatially varying sensitivities of all three crops to ozone exposures than are implied by experimentally derived concentration-response functions used in most previous studies. Stronger ozone tolerance is found in regions with high ozone levels and high consumptive crop water use, reflecting the existence of spatial adaptation and effect of water constraints. The spatially varying sensitivities to temperature extremes also indicate stronger heat tolerance in crops grown in warmer regions. The spatial adaptation of crops to ozone and temperature we find can serve as a surrogate for future adaptation. Using the PDLR-derived sensitivities and 2000-2050 ozone and temperature projections by the Community Earth System Model, we estimate that future warming and unmitigated ozone pollution can combine to cause an average decline in US wheat, maize and soybean production by 13%, 43% and 28%, respectively, and a smaller decline for European crops. Aggressive ozone regulation is shown to offset such decline to various extents, especially for wheat. Our findings demonstrate the importance of considering ozone regulation as well as ozone and climate change adaptation (e.g., selecting heat- and ozone-tolerant cultivars, irrigation) as possible strategies to enhance future food security in response to imminent environmental threats.

Coupling genomic technologies with physiological crop responses in a dynamic field environment is an effective approach to dissect the mechanisms underpinning crop responses to abiotic stress. Soybean (Glycine max L. Merr. cv. Pioneer 93B15) was grown in natural production environments with projected changes to environmental conditions predicted for the end of the century, including decreased precipitation, increased tropospheric ozone concentrations ([O3]), or increased temperature.<br /><br /><strong>RESULTS: </strong>All three environmental stresses significantly decreased leaf-level photosynthesis and stomatal conductance, leading to significant losses in seed yield. This was driven by a significant decrease in the number of pods per node for all abiotic stress treatments. To understand the underlying transcriptomic response involved in the yield response to environmental stress, RNA-Sequencing analysis was performed on the soybean seed coat, a tissue that plays an essential role in regulating carbon and nitrogen transport to developing seeds. Gene expression analysis revealed 49, 148 and 1,576 differentially expressed genes in the soybean seed coat in response to drought, elevated [O3] and elevated temperature, respectively.<br /><br /><strong>CONCLUSIONS: </strong>Elevated [O3] and drought did not elicit substantive transcriptional changes in the soybean seed coat. However, this may be due to the timing of sampling and does not preclude impacts of those stresses on different tissues or different stages in seed coat development.

In particular, investigators use varied methods of bronchoalveolar lavage and euthanasia but their impact to assessments of injury and inflammation are unknown. To define potential effects, we compared methods of lavage and euthanasia in uninjured mice and following a mild lung injury model (ozone). C57BL/6J male mice age 8-10 weeks underwent BAL following euthanasia with ketamine/xylazine, carbon dioxide (C02), or isoflurane. BAL methods included 800-?L instilled and withdrawn three times, and 1 or 3 passive fill(s) and drainage to 20cm H20. Parallel experiments were performed 24hr following 3hr of ozone (O3) exposure at 2 parts per million (ppm). BAL total cell counts/differentials and total protein/albumin were determined. Lung histology was evaluated for lung inflammation/injury. BAL cells were cultured and stimulated with PBS, phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) or lipopolysaccharide (LPS) for 4hr and supernatants were evaluated for cytokine content. In uninjured mice, we observed differences due to the lavage and euthanasia methods. The lavage method increased uninjured and O3exposure total cells and total protein/albumin with 800-?L instillation having the highest values. Isoflurane increased uninjured total BAL cells, while C02euthanasia increased the uninjured total protein/albumin levels. These effects limited the ability to detect differences in BAL injury measures following O3exposure.

During germination, the seeds were exposed to three peaks of O-3 concentration (125ppb for 5 and 10days; 185ppb for 5days), derived from measurements taken close to the species growing site. High O-3 concentration delayed the first germination time, increased the mean germination time, and reduced the germination percentage during and immediately after the treatment, but, in most cases, effects were weak and had almost vanished threeweeks after the treatments. In few cases, chronic exposure to O-3 (125 for 10days' treatment) enhanced seed germination compared to the control, suggesting that ozone may induce antioxidant and DNA-repair mechanisms or dormancy-breaking effects in hydrated seeds. Although seed mortality increased during O-3 treatments in four species, the effect of O-3 on seed germination is mostly limited to the period of exposure, indicating that it is unlikely to produce permanent negative effects on seeds, during the germination phase.

Comparably, rapid increases of NO2of more than 8??g/m3tended to increase myocardial infarction risk by 73% (OR 1.73, 95% CI 0.91-3.28) while myocardial infarction risk decreased by 60% after a decrease of NO2concentration of more than 8??g/m3(OR 0.4, 95% CI 0.21-0.77), suggesting a close-to-linear association. While results for ozone concentrations were ambiguous, rapid change in PM10was not associated with myocardial infarction risk. Conclusion Dynamics and extent of increase in nitrogen oxide concentrations may be an independent risk factor for myocardial infarction. As there are currently no European Union statutory limits reflecting this dynamic variation of air pollutants on a daily basis, the results urgently call for confirming studies in different geographical regions to verify the observations.",0,0,4.3.1,Short Term Ozone Exposure

Residential long-term exposure to PNC and various other size fractions of particulate matter (PM10with size of &lt;10??m in aerodynamic diameter, PMcoarse2.5-10??m or PM2.5?&lt;?2.5??m, respectively), soot (PM2.5abs: absorbance of PM2.5), nitrogen oxides (nitrogen dioxide NO2or oxides NOx, respectively) and ozone (O3) were estimated by land-use regression models. Associations between annual air pollution concentrations and hs-CRP were modeled in 2252 participants using linear regression models adjusted for several confounders. Potential effect-modifiers were examined by interaction terms and two-pollutant models were calculated for pollutants with Spearman inter-correlation &lt;0.70.<br /><br /><strong>RESULTS: </strong>Single pollutant models for PNC, PM10, PMcoarse, PM2.5abs, NO2and NOxshowed positive but non-significant associations with hs-CRP. For PNC, an interquartile range (2000 particles/cm3) increase was associated with a 3.6% (95% CI: -0.9%, 8.3%) increase in hs-CRP. A null association was found for PM2.5. Effect estimates were higher for women, non-obese participants, for participants without diabetes and without a history of cardiovascular disease whereas ex-smokers showed lower estimates compared to smokers or non-smokers. For O3, the dose-response function suggested a non-linear relationship. In two-pollutant models, adjustment for PM2.5strengthened the effect estimates for PNC and PM10(6.3% increase per 2000 particles/cm3[95% CI: 0.4%; 12.5%] and 7.3% per 16.5??g/m3[95% CI: 0.4%; 14.8%], respectively).<br /><br /><strong>CONCLUSION: </strong>This study adds to a scarce but growing body of literature showing associations between long-term exposure to ultrafine particles and hs-CRP, one of the most intensely studied blood biomarkers for cardiovascular health.

Air pollutants increase the release of stress hormones (human cortisol, rodent corticosterone), which could contribute to metabolic dysregulation. We assessed acute effects of ozone, and stress axis involvement, on glucose tolerance and on the metabolic (triglyceride), endocrine/energy regulation (insulin, glucagon, GLP-1, leptin, ghrelin, corticosterone), and inflammatory/endothelial (TNF, IL-6, VEGF, PAI-1) response to exogenous glucose. Male Fischer-344 rats were exposed to clean air or 0.8?ppm ozone for 4?h in whole body chambers. Hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis involvement in ozone effects was tested through subcutaneous administration of the glucocorticoid synthesis inhibitor metyrapone (50?mg/kg body weight), corticosterone (10?mg/kg body weight), or vehicle (40% propylene glycol) prior to exposure. A glucose tolerance test (2?g/kg body weight glucose) was conducted immediately after exposure, with blood samples collected at 0, 30, 60, 90, and 120?min. Ozone exposure impaired glucose tolerance, an effect accompanied by increased plasma triglycerides but no impairment of insulin release. Ozone diminished glucagon, GLP-1, and ghrelin responses to glucose, but did not significantly impact inflammatory/endothelial analytes. Metyrapone reduced corticosterone but increased glucose and triglycerides, complicating evaluation of the impact of glucocorticoid inhibition. However, administration of corticosterone reproduced the profile of ozone effects, supporting a role for the HPA axis. The results show that ozone-dependent changes in glucose tolerance are accompanied by altered metabolic and endocrine responses to glucose challenge that are reproduced by exogenous stress hormone.",0,0,5.1.2,Biological Plausibility

To meet some of the limitations of previous studies using grouped-analysis, we developed a cohort study of persons with congestive heart failure to estimate whether daily non-accidental mortality were associated with spatially-resolved, daily exposures to ambient nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and ozone (O3), and whether these associations were modified according to a series of indicators potentially reflecting complications or worsening of health.<br /><br /><strong>METHODS: </strong>We constructed the cohort from the linkage of administrative health databases. Daily exposure was assigned from different methods we developed previously to predict spatially-resolved, time-dependent concentrations of ambient NO2(all year) and O3(warm season) at participants' residences. We performed two distinct types of analyses: a case-crossover that contrasts the same person at different times, and a nested case-control that contrasts different persons at similar times. We modelled the effects of air pollution and weather (case-crossover only) on mortality using distributed lag nonlinear models over lags 0 to 3?days. We developed from administrative health data a series of indicators that may reflect the underlying construct of &quot;declining health&quot;, and used interactions between these indicators and the cross-basis function for air pollutant to assess potential effect modification.<br /><br /><strong>RESULTS: </strong>The magnitude of the cumulative as well as the lag-specific estimates of association differed in many instances according to the metric of exposure. Using the back-extrapolation method, which is our preferred exposure model, we found for the case-crossover design a cumulative mean percentage changes (MPC) in daily mortality per interquartile increment in NO2(8.8?ppb) of 3.0% (95% CI: -0.9, 6.9%) and for O3(16.5?ppb) 3.5% (95% CI: -4.5, 12.1). For O3there was strong confounding by weather (unadjusted MPC?=?7.1%; 95% CI: 1.7, 12.7%). For the nested case-control approach the cumulative MPC for NO2in daily mortality was 2.9% (95% CI: -0.9, 6.9%) and for O37.3% (95% CI: 3.0, 11.9%). We found evidence of effect modification between daily mortality and cumulative NO2and O3according to the prescribed dose of furosemide in the nested case-control analysis, but not in the case-crossover analysis.<br /><br /><strong>CONCLUSIONS: </strong>Mortality in congestive heart failure was associated with exposure to daily ambient NO2and O3predicted from a back-extrapolation method using a land use regression model from dense sampling surveys.

Spatiotemporal ESCAPE-LUR models were used to estimate daily and annual air pollution exposures (including PM10, PMCoarse, but not Ozone {derived from closest station}) at participant residential and occupational addresses. Participants' time-activity diaries indicated time spent at either address to allow daily space-time-activity-weighted estimates, and capture total daily physical activity (total-PA {as metabolic-equivalents-of-task, METs}), in the three days preceding health measurements. Multivariate-adjusted linear mixed-effects models (using either annual or daily estimates) were adjusted for possible environmental confounders or mediators including levels of ambient noise and greenness. Causal mediation analysis was also performed separately considering these factors as well as total-PA. All presented models are controlled by age, height, sex and season.<br /><br /><strong>RESULTS: </strong>An increase in 5?g/m3of daily space-time-activity-weighted PMCoarseexposure was statistically significantly associated with a 4.1% reduction in total heart rate variability (SDNN; p=0.01), and remained robust after adjusting for suspected confounders [except for occupational-address noise (?=-2.7, p=0.20)].

TNF-stimulated gene 6 (TSG-6) is required to transfer inter-?-inhibitor heavy chains (HC) to hyaluronan (HA), facilitating HA receptor binding. TSG-6 is necessary for AHR in allergic asthma, because it facilitates the development of a pathological HA-HC matrix. However, the role of TSG-6 in acute airway inflammation is not well understood. Here, we hypothesized that TSG-6 is essential for the development of HA- and ozone-induced AHR. TSG-6-/-and TSG-6+/+mice were exposed to ozone or short-fragment HA (sHA), and AHR was assayed via flexiVent. The AHR response to sHA was evaluated in the isolated tracheal ring assay in tracheal rings from TSG-6-/-or TSG-6+/+, with or without the addition of exogenous TSG-6, and with or without inhibitors of Rho-associated, coiled-coil-containing protein kinase (ROCK), ERK, or PI3K. Smooth-muscle cells from mouse tracheas were assayedin vitrofor signaling pathways. We found that TSG-6 deficiency protects against AHR after ozone (in vivo) or sHA (in vitroandin vivo) exposure. Moreover, TSG-6-/-tracheal ring non-responsiveness to sHA was reversed by exogenous TSG-6 addition. sHA rapidly activated RhoA, ERK, and Akt in airway smooth-muscle cells, but only in the presence of TSG-6. Inhibition of ROCK, ERK, or PI3K/Akt blocked sHA/TSG-6-mediated AHR. In conclusion, TSG-6 is necessary for AHR in response to ozone or sHA, in part because it facilitates rapid formation of HA-HC complexes. The sHA/TSG-6 effect is mediated by RhoA, ERK, and PI3K/Akt signaling.",0,0,3.1.4.3.2,Animal Toxicological Studies

To investigate changes in the belowground bacterial community composition in response to elevated CO2and O3(eCO2and eO3) the endosphere, rhizosphere and soil were sampled from soybeans under eCO2and maize under eO3. The maize rhizosphere and endosphere ?-diversity was higher than soybean, which may be due to a high relative abundance of Rhizobiales. Only the rhizosphere microbiome composition of the soybeans changed in response to eCO2, associated with an increased abundance of nitrogen fixing microbes. In maize, the microbiome composition was altered by the genotype and linked to differences in root exudate profiles. The eO3treatment did not change the microbial communities in the rhizosphere, but altered the soil communities where hybrid maize was grown. In contrast to previous studies that focused exclusively on the soil, this study provides new insights into the effects of plant root exudates on the composition of the belowground microbiome in response to changing atmospheric conditions.

Recent observational evidence shows that halogens are pervasive in the troposphere and need to be represented in chemistry-transport models for an accurate simulation of present-day O-3. Using the GEOS-Chem model we show that tropospheric halogen chemistry is likely more active in the present day than in the preindustrial. This is due to increased oceanic iodine emissions driven by increased surface O-3, higher anthropogenic emissions of bromo-carbons, and an increased flux of bromine from the stratosphere. We calculate preindustrial to present-day increases in the tropospheric O-3 burden of 113 Tg without halogens but only 90 Tg with, leading to a reduction in RFTO3 from 0.43 to 0.35 Wm(-2). We attribute similar to 50% of this reduction to increased bromine flux from the stratosphere, similar to 35% to the ocean-atmosphere iodine feedback, and similar to 15% to increased tropospheric sources of anthropogenic halogens. This reduction of tropospheric O-3 radiative forcing due to halogens (0.087W m(-2)) is greater than that from the radiative forcing of stratospheric O-3 (similar to 0.05 Wm(-2)).

Jarvis-type multiplicative model has been recommended for estimating stomatal ozone flux in forest trees. Ozone can change stomatal conductance by both stomatal closure and less efficient stomatal control (stomatal sluggishness). However, current Jarvis-type models do not account for these ozone effects on stomatal conductance in forest trees. We examined seasonal course of stomatal conductance in two common deciduous tree species native to northern Japan (white birch: Betula platyphylla var. japonica; deciduous oak: Quercus mongolica var. crispula) grown under free-air ozone exposure. We innovatively considered stomatal sluggishness in the Jarvis-type model using a simple parameter, s, relating to cumulative ozone uptake (defined as POD: phytotoxic ozone dose). We found that ozone decreased stomatal conductance of white birch leaves after full expansion (-28%). However, such a reduction of stomatal conductance by ozone fell in late summer (-10%). At the same time, ozone reduced stomatal sensitivity of white birch to VPD and increased stomatal conductance under low light conditions. In contrast, in deciduous oak, ozone did not clearly change the model parameters. The consideration of both ozone-induced stomatal closure and stomatal sluggishness improved the model performance to estimate stomatal conductance and to explain the dose-response relationship on ozone-induced decline of photosynthesis of white birch.

Lean wild-type and obese db/db mice were pretreated with IL-17A-blocking or isotype antibodies, exposed to air or ozone (2 ppm for 3 h), and evaluated 24 hours later. Microarray analysis of lung tissue gene expression was used to examine the mechanistic basis for effects of anti-IL-17A.

Ozone-induced increases in BAL IL-23 and CCL20, cytokines important for IL-17A+cell recruitment and activation, were also greater in obese mice. Anti-IL-17A treatment reduced ozone-induced airway hyperresponsiveness toward levels observed in lean mice. Anti-IL-17A treatment also reduced BAL neutrophils in both lean and obese mice, possibly because of reductions in CXCL1. Microarray analysis identified gastrin-releasing peptide (GRP) receptor (Grpr) among those genes that were both elevated in the lungs of obese mice after ozone exposure and reduced after anti-IL-17A treatment. Furthermore, ozone exposure increased BAL GRP to a greater extent in obese than in lean mice, and GRP-neutralizing antibody treatment reduced obesity-related increases in ozone-induced airway hyperresponsiveness and neutrophil recruitment.

In 2011, potted plants were exposed to ambient ozone from May to August. These same plants were grown in open-top chambers (OTCs) in 2012 and 2013, and exposed to charcoal-filtered (CF), non-filtered (NF), elevated ozone (EO), NF+50ppb in 2012 for 47days and NF+30/NF+50ppb ozone in 2013 for 36 and 36days, respectively.

Several small molecule disrupters of the Nrf2-Keap1 complex have recently been tested and/or approved for human therapeutic use but lack either potency or selectivity. The main goal of our work was to develop a potent, selective activator of NRF2 as protection against oxidative stress. In human bronchial epithelial cells, our Nrf2 activator, 3-(pyridin-3-ylsulfonyl)-5-(trifluoromethyl)-2H-chromen-2-one (PSTC), induced Nrf2 nuclear translocation, Nrf2-regulated gene expression, and downstream signaling events, including induction of NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1) enzyme activity and heme oxygenase-1 protein expression, in an Nrf2-dependent manner. As a marker of subsequent functional activity, PSTC restored oxidant (tert-butyl hydroperoxide)-induced glutathione depletion. The compound's engagement of the Nrf2 signaling pathway translated to an in vivo setting, with induction of Nrf2-regulated gene expression and NQO1 enzyme activity, as well as restoration of oxidant (ozone)-induced glutathione depletion, occurring in the lungs of PSTC-treated rodents. Under disease conditions, PSTC engaged its target, inducing the expression of Nrf2-regulated genes in human bronchial epithelial cells derived from patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, as well as in the lungs of cigarette smoke-exposed mice. Subsequent to the latter, a dose-dependent inhibition of cigarette smoke-induced pulmonary inflammation was observed. Finally, in contrast with bardoxolone methyl and sulforaphane, PSTC did not inhibit interleukin-1?-induced nuclear factor-?B translocation or insulin-induced S6 phosphorylation in human cells, emphasizing the on-target activity of this compound.

Tree C sequestration was assessed by using empirical response functions, while soil C sequestration was simulated with the process-based model VSD, combined with the RothC model. We evaluated two empirical growth responses to N deposition (linear and non-linear) and two O3exposure relationships (linear function with total biomass or net annual increment). We further investigated an 'interactive model' with interactions between drivers and a 'multiplicative model', in which the combined effect is the product of individual drivers. A single deposition and climate scenario was used for the period 1900-2050. Contrary to expectations, growth observations at European level for the period 1950-2010 compared better with predictions by the multiplicative model than with the interactive model. This coincides with the fact that carbon responses in kgCha-1yr-1per unit change in drivers, i.e. per ?C, ppm CO2, kgNha-1yr-1and mmolm-2yr-1POD, are more in line with literature data when using the multiplicative model. Compared to 1900, the estimated European average total C sequestration in both forests and forest soils between 1950 and 2000 increased by 21% in the interactive model and by 41% in the multiplicative model, but observed changes were even higher. This growth increase is expected to decline between 2000 and 2050. The simulated changes between 1950 and 2000 were mainly due to the increase in both N deposition and CO2, while the predicted increases between 2000 and 2050 were mainly caused by the increase in CO2and temperature, and to lesser extent a decrease in POD, counteracted by reduced N deposition.",0,0,8.8.1,Terrestrial Primary Productivity

Methods: An ozone-stressed lung injury animal model was established by exposure to 2.0 ppm O3 for 30 min every day for consecutive 12 day with or without the administration of NO precursor L-arginine or non-selective NOS inhibitor N-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME). Then, the lung histopathology, the releases of inflammatory mediators and the production of ROS were assayed by immunohistochemistry, ELISA and flow cytometry respectively. The activities and expression of NOS and Arginase were assayed by biochemical methods and western blot. Correspondingly, the release of 8-oxoguanine glycosylase 1(8-OxoG) and 8-oxoguanine glycosylase 1 (OGG1) were assayed by ELISA and western blot. The correlation between NOS/Arginase signaling with 8-OxoG/ OGG1 was also analyzed by Pearson correlation coefficients and immunofluorescence in NOS deficient bronchial epithelial cells.

Results: In ozone-induced rat lung injury models, lung inflammation as well as lung architecture was disrupted in a time dependent manner. Ozone treatment with L-arginine showed a substantial attenuation of adverse lung histopathological changes and treatment with L-NAME promoted the inflammation and remodeling. Importantly, the expression of NOS was promoted by L-arginine and inhibited by L-NAME and the expression of Arginase was promoted by L-NAME treatment. Further, we observed significantly higher levels of 8-OxoG and lower levels of OGG1 in ozone group which was reversed by L-arginine and promoted by L-NAME. The expression of NOS is closely related with 8-OxoG /OCG1.

The O3and whitefly herbivory significantly increased the production of volatile organic compounds (VOCs), including monoterpenes and green leaf volatiles (GLVs). The Wt plants released higher volatile levels, particularly monoterpenes, than did the spr2 plants. In Y-tube tests, limonene and Z-3-hexanol played key roles in the attraction of E. formosa. Moreover, regardless of plant genotype, the two plant genotypes were preferred by adult E. formosa under the O3and O3+ herbivory treatments. Our results suggest that under elevated O3, the activation of the JA pathway significantly up-regulates the emission rates of volatiles, through which the efficacy of natural enemy might be promoted.",0,0,8.6.1,Individual Level Responses

The Fall 2014 trial also tested the effect of nighttime-only (2000-0700 HR = 11 hoursday(-1)) O-3 exposure. Nighttime O-3 exposure alone, at 62 ppb, did not cause foliar injury and had no effect on the yield of either genotype. In combination with daytime O-3 exposure, nighttime O-3 concentrations up to 78 ppb did not impact yields or show a consistent effect on nocturnal stomatal conductance (g(sn)). When data were pooled across the day and day + night exposures times, mean daytime O-3 levels >= 62 ppb caused foliar injury and significant yield decreases in all three trials. Under control conditions, R123 and S156 produced similar pod masses in two of the three trials. In all three trials, R123 produced significantly greater yields by mass than S156 with elevated O-3.

Chemokine receptor CCR2 mediates the migration of inflammatory monocytes/macrophages to sites of tissue injury. It is also required for monocyte egress from the bone marrow. In the present studies, we analyzed the role of CCR2 in inflammatory cell trafficking to the lung in response to ozone. Treatment of mice with ozone (0.8?ppm, 3?h) resulted in increases in proinflammatory CCR2+macrophages in the lung at 24?h, as well as proinflammatory CD11b?+?Ly6CHiand iNOS+?macrophages at 24 and 48?h. Mannose receptor+?anti-inflammatory macrophages were also observed in the lung 24 and 48?h post-ozone. Loss of CCR2 was associated with reduced numbers of proinflammatory macrophages in the lung and decreased expression of the proinflammatory cytokines, IL-1? and TNF?. Decreases in anti-inflammatory CD11b?+?Ly6CLomacrophages were also observed in lungs of CCR2-/-mice treated with ozone, whereas mannose receptor+?macrophage accumulation was delayed; conversely, CX3CL1 and CX3CR1 were upregulated. Changes in lung macrophage subpopulations and inflammatory gene expression in CCR2-/-mice were correlated with reduced ozone toxicity and oxidative stress, as measured by decreases in bronchoalveolar lavage protein content and reduced lung expression of heme-oxygenase-1, 4-hydroxynonenal and cytochrome b5. These data demonstrate that CCR2 plays a role in both pro- and anti-inflammatory macrophage accumulation in the lung following ozone exposure.

In this study, Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris) seedlings were exposed to moderate warming (ca. 1 degrees C), 1.5 x ambient ozone (O-3) concentration, fertilizer addition (120 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1)) and shoot herbivory by pine sawfly (Acantholyda posticalis) alone and in combination. We measured fine root morphology, mycorrhizal colonization level, root fungal biomass (ergosterol), rhizosphere emission of biogenic volatile organic compounds (BVOCs), and microbial biomass (PLFAs) in the rhizosphere soil as well as seedling above- and below-ground growth. Warming and fertilization effects on fine root proportions or root fungal biomass occurred in combination with other factors, combination effects being usually negative on the studied variables, or then warming and fertilization in combination cancelled some other factors' effects. O-3 effects on needle growth, root fungal biomass and BVOCs were more often seen after the third exposure year, and sometimes only in combination with other studied factors. Of abiotic factors, fertilizer addition had reducing effect on rhizosphere BVOCs. Though increased nitrogen availability and warming increased both shoot and root dry masses, growth allocation to above- and below-ground parts was not equally increased in the combined exposures. Thus, we conclude that climate change factors together with increased nitrogen availability and herbivory are likely to affect the below-ground compartments negatively, more often than shoots, and ultimately change in growth allocation pattern which may affect overall seedling growth and survival in later years.

They establish plant-microbe or microbe-microbe associations, forming a unique microbiota with each plant species and under different environmental conditions. These microbial communities have to adapt to diverse environmental conditions, such as geographical location, climate conditions and soil types, and are subjected to changes in their surrounding environment. Elevated ozone concentration is one of the most important aspects of global change, but its effect on microbial communities living on plant surfaces has barely been investigated. In the current study, we aimed at elucidating the potential effect of elevated ozone concentrations on the phyllosphere (aerial part of the plant) and rhizoplane (surface of the root) microbiota by adopting next-generation 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing. A standard japonica rice cultivar Nipponbare and an ozone-tolerant breeding line L81 (Nipponbare background) were pre-grown in a greenhouse for 10 weeks and then exposed to ozone at 85 ppb for 7 h daily for 30 days in open top chambers. Microbial cells were collected from the phyllosphere and rhizoplane separately. The treatment or different genotypes did not affect various diversity indices. On the other hand, the relative abundance of some bacterial taxa were significantly affected in the rhizoplane community of ozone-treated plants. A significant effect of ozone was detected by homogeneity of molecular variance analysis in the phyllosphere, meaning that the community from ozone-treated phyllosphere samples was more variable than those from control plants. In addition, a weak treatment effect was observed by clustering samples based on the Yue and Clayton and weighted UniFrac distance matrices among samples. We therefore conclude that the elevated ozone concentrations affected the bacterial community structure of the phyllosphere and the rhizosplane as a whole, even though this effect was rather weak and did not lead to changes of the function of the communities.",0,0,8.1.2.1,Bacteria

A wealth of studies have examined the variation in CO2 responses across tree species, but the extent of intraspecific variation in response to elevated CO2 (eCO2) has, so far, been examined in individual studies and syntheses of published work are currently lacking. We conducted a meta-analysis on the effects of eCO2 on tree growth (height, stem biomass and stem volume) and photosynthesis across genotypes to examine whether there is genetic variation in growth responses to eCO2 and to understand their dependence on photosynthesis. We additionally examined the interaction between the responses to eCO2 and ozone (O3), another global change agent. Most of the published studies so far have been conducted in juveniles and in Populus spp., although the patterns observed were not species dependent. All but one study reported significant genetic variation in stem biomass, and the magnitude of intraspecific variation in response to eCO2 was similar in magnitude to previous analyses on interspecific variation. Growth at eCO2 was predictable from growth at ambient CO2 (R(2)?=?0.60), and relative rankings of genotype performance were preserved across CO2 levels, indicating no significant interaction between genotypic and environmental effects. The growth response to eCO2 was not correlated with the response of photosynthesis (P?&gt;?0.1), and while we observed 57.7% average increases in leaf photosynthesis, stem biomass and volume increased by 36 and 38.5%, respectively, and height only increased by 9.5%, suggesting a predominant role for carbon allocation in ultimately driving the response to eCO2 Finally, best-performing genotypes under eCO2 also responded better under eCO2 and elevated O3 Further research needs include widening the study of intraspecific variation beyond the genus Populus and examining the interaction between eCO2 and other environmental stressors.

Morphological symptoms were worst in the combined treatment, indicating a severe stress, but fewer proteins were differentially abundant in the combined treatment than for ozone alone. Stomatal conductance was slightly lowered in the combined treatment. Shifts in carbon metabolism indicated that the metabolism changed to accommodate for protective measures and changes in the abundance of proteins involved in redox protection indicated the presence of an oxidative stress. This study allowed identifying a set of proteins that changed similarly during ozone and drought stress, indicative of crosstalk in the molecular response of plants exposed to these stresses.

However, large uncertainties remain in the prediction of future changes of SUR (Bais et al., 2015). Several studies pointed out that UV-B impacts the biosphere (Erickson et al., 2015), especially the aquatic system, which plays a central part in the biogeochemical cycle (Hader et al., 2007). It can affect phytoplankton productivity (Smith and Cullen, 1995). This influence can result in either positive or negative feedback on climate (Zepp et al., 2007).
<br>
<br>Global circulation model simulations predict an acceleration of the Brewer-Dobson circulation over the next century (Butchart, 2014), which would lead to a decrease in ozone levels in the tropics and an enhancement at higher latitudes (Hegglin and Shepherd, 2009). Reunion Island is located in the tropics (21 degrees S, 55 degrees E), in a part of the world where the amount of ozone in the ozone column is naturally low. In addition, this island is mountainous and the marine atmosphere is often clean with low aerosol concentrations. Thus, measurements show much higher SUR than at other sites at the same latitude or at midlatitudes. Ground-based measurements of SUR have been taken on Reunion Island by a Bentham DTMc300 spectroradiometer since 2009. This instrument is affiliated with the Network for the Detection of Atmospheric Composition Change (NDACC). In order to quantify the future evolution of SUR in the tropics, it is necessary to validate a model against present observations. This study is designed to be a preliminary parametric and sensitivity study of SUR modelling in the tropics.
<br>
<br>We developed a local parameterisation using the Tropospheric Ultraviolet and Visible Model (TUV; Madronich, 1993) and compared the output of TUV to multiple years of Bentham spectral measurements. This comparison started in early 2009 and continued until 2016.
<br>
<br>Only clear-sky SUR was modelled, so we needed to sort out the clear-sky measurements. We used two methods to detect cloudy conditions: the first was based on an observer's hourly report on the sky cover, while the second was based on applying Long and Ackerman (2000)'s algorithm to broadband pyranometer data to obtain the cloud fraction and then discriminating clear-sky windows on SUR measurements. Long et al. (2006)'s algorithm, with the co-located pyranometer data, gave better results for clear-sky filtering than the observer's report.
<br>
<br>Multiple model inputs were tested to evaluate the model sensitivity to different parameters such as total ozone column, aerosol optical properties, extraterrestrial spectrum or ozone cross section. For total column ozone, we used ground-based measurements from the SAOZ (Systeme d'Analyse par Observation Zenithale) spectrometer and satellite measurements from the OMI and SBUV instruments, while ozone profiles were derived from radio-soundings and the MLS ozone product. Aerosol optical properties came from a local aerosol climatology established using a Cimel photometer. Since the mean difference between various inputs of total ozone column was small, the corresponding response on UVI modelling was also quite small, at about 1 %.

The purpose of this study was to investigate factors that underlie these observations, by studying histopathologic changes in lung and extrapulmonary (spleen and liver) tissues after ozone or filtered air (FA) exposure followed by pulmonary bacterial infection. Male and female wild type C57BL/6J mice were exposed to ozone or FA, then anesthetized and infected intratracheally with Klebsiella pneumoniae bacteria. Tissues (lung, spleen, and liver) were subjected to histopathologic analysis at 48 h post-infection. We found that after infection, 1) the severity of inflammation was higher, the affected area of the lung was larger, and spleen red pulp myelopoiesis was lower in ozone-exposed mice compared to FA-exposed animals in both sexes; 2) more pronounced extrapulmonary lesions (in liver and spleen) were observed in FA-exposed males compared to FA-exposed females; and 3) excessive lung inflammatory response was detected in ozone-exposed females compared to ozone-exposed males. We concluded that different risk factors contribute to the differential outcome of pneumonia between sexes in the presence or absence of ozone-induced oxidative stress.

They are central to our understanding of climate change and air quality degradation. Atmospheric chemistry models, whether online or offline, box, regional or global, use these rate constants. Expert panels evaluate laboratory measurements, making recommendations for the rate constants that should be used. This results in very similar or identical rate constants being used by all models. The inherent uncertainties in these recommendations are, in general, therefore ignored. We explore the impact of these uncertainties on the composition of the troposphere using the GEOS-Chem chemistry transport model. Based on the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) and International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) evaluations we assess the influence of 50 mainly inorganic rate constants and 10 photolysis rates on tropospheric composition through the use of the GEOS-Chem chemistry transport model.
<br>
<br>We assess the impact on four standard metrics: annual mean tropospheric ozone burden, surface ozone and tropospheric OH concentrations, and tropospheric methane lifetime. Uncertainty in the rate constants for NO2 + OH <(M)under right arrow> HNO3 and O-3 + NO -> NO2 + O-2 are the two largest sources of uncertainty in these metrics. The absolute magnitude of the change in the metrics is similar if rate constants are increased or decreased by their sigma values. We investigate two methods of assessing these uncertainties, addition in quadrature and a Monte Carlo approach, and conclude they give similar outcomes. Combining the uncertainties across the 60 reactions gives overall uncertainties on the annual mean tropospheric ozone burden, surface ozone and tropospheric OH concentrations, and tropospheric methane lifetime of 10, 11, 16 and 16 %, respectively. These are larger than the spread between models in recent model intercomparisons. Remote regions such as the tropics, poles and upper troposphere are most uncertain. This chemical uncertainty is sufficiently large to suggest that rate constant uncertainty should be considered alongside other processes when model results disagree with measurement.
<br>
<br>Calculations for the pre-industrial simulation allow a tropospheric ozone radiative forcing to be calculated of 0.412 +/- 0.062 W m(-2). This uncertainty (13 %) is comparable to the inter-model spread in ozone radiative forcing found in previous model-model intercomparison studies where the rate constants used in the models are all identical or very similar. Thus, the uncertainty of tropospheric ozone radiative forcing should expanded to include this additional source of uncertainty. These rate constant uncertainties are significant and suggest that refinement of supposedly well-known chemical rate constants should be considered alongside other improvements to enhance our understanding of atmospheric processes.",0,0,9.2.1,Recent Evidence for Historical Period

Here we examined the role of the microbiome in pulmonary responses to a non-allergic asthma trigger, ozone. We depleted the microbiota of conventional mice with either a single antibiotic (ampicillin, metronidazole, neomycin, or vancomycin) or a cocktail of all four antibiotics given via the drinking water. Mice were then exposed to room air or ozone. In air-exposed mice, airway responsiveness was not different in antibiotic- versus control water-treated mice. Ozone caused airway hyperresponsiveness, the magnitude of which was decreased in antibiotic cocktail- versus water-treated mice. Except for neomycin, single antibiotics had effects similar to the cocktail. Compared to conventional mice, germ-free mice also had attenuated airway responsiveness after ozone. 16S rRNA gene sequencing of fecal DNA to characterize the gut microbiome indicated that bacterial genera that were decreased in mice with reduced ozone-induced airway hyperresponsiveness after antibiotic treatment were short chain fatty acid producers. Serum analysis indicated reduced concentrations of the short chain fatty acid, propionate, in cocktail- but not neomycin-treated mice. Dietary enrichment with pectin, which increased serum short chain fatty acids, also augmented ozone-induced airway hyperresponsiveness. Furthermore, propionate supplementation of the drinking water augmented ozone-induced airway hyperresponsiveness in conventional mice. Our data indicate that the microbiome contributes to ozone-induced airway hyperresponsiveness, likely via its ability to produce short chain fatty acids.",0,0,3.1.4.3.2,Animal Toxicological Studies

The impacts of air pollutants on Mediterranean forest ecosystems (evergreen sclerophyllous forests and maquis) are poorly understood. The Mediterranean climate encourages the generation of  high concentrations of ozone ? now recognised to be the most prevalent and damaging air pollutant to which vegetation is exposed in many regions. In this paper, we examine the way in which many of the typical morphological and ecophysiological features of Mediterranean vegetation influence ozone impacts, plus the way in which the  combination of environmental stresses to which Mediterranean vegetation is exposed in the field affect responses to ozone. Sclerophyllous Mediterranean species (typified by leaves with dense mesophyll, little intercellular air space and containing an abundance of primary, e.g. ascorbate, and secondary metabolites, e.g. tannins and phenylpropanoids, that are capable of protecting key biomolecules from oxidative stress) might be expected to be hardier than their counterparts more typical of the relatively mesic environments of Northern and Continental Europe. Moreover, soil water shortage during the height of summer causes partial stomatal closure for lengthy periods each day. As a result, vegetation may avoid taking-up the ozone when concentrations are at their highest. There are several confirmed reports of visible symptoms of ozone damage (chlorotic mottle, necrosis, reddening etc.) on important crops and forest trees.  The significance of these observations is discussed, along with the way in which ongoing changes in the Mediterranean environment may affect the future impacts of rising ozone concentrations on vegetation.",0,0,8.2,Visible Foliar Injury and Biomonitoring

Elevated ozone and CO2 can differentially affect the performance of plant species. Variation among native, exotic and invader species in their growth and defense responses to CO2 and ozone may shape CO2 and ozone effects on invasions, perhaps in part also due to variation between native and invasive populations of invaders.

Methods
We manipulated ozone (control or 100 ppb) and CO2 (ambient or 800 ppm) in a factorial greenhouse experiment in replicated chambers. We investigated growth and defense (tannins) of seedlings of Triadica sebifera from invasive (USA) and native (China) populations and pairs of US and China tree species within three genera (Celtis, Liquidambar and Platanus).

Important Findings
Overall, ozone reduced growth in ambient CO2 but elevated CO2 limited this effect. T. sebifera plants from invasive populations had higher growth than those from native populations in control conditions or the combination of elevated CO2 and ozone in which invasive populations had greater increases in growth. Their performances were similar in elevated CO2 because native populations were more responsive and their performances were similar with elevated ozone because invasive populations were more susceptible. Compared to other species, T. sebifera had high growth rates but low levels of tannin production that were insensitive to variation in CO2 or ozone. Both China and US Platanus plants reduced tannins with increased CO2 and/or ozone and US Liquidambar plants increased tannins with the combination of elevated CO2 and ozone. The growth results suggest that intraspecific variation in T. sebifera will reduce the effects of CO2 or ozone alone on invasions but increase their combined effects. The tannin results suggest that defense responses to CO2 and ozone will be variable across native and exotic species. The effects of CO2 and ozone on growth and defense of native and exotic species indicate that the benefit or harm to species from these global change drivers is an idiosyncratic combination of species origin and genus.",0,0,8.3.1,Declines in Growth Rates

It has been proposed that nitrogen (N) availability will exert an increasingly limiting effect on plants' ability to store additional carbon (C) under rising CO2 , but these mechanisms are not well understood. Here, we review findings from elevated CO2 experiments using a plant economics framework, highlighting how ecosystem responses to elevated CO2 may depend on the costs and benefits of plant interactions with mycorrhizal fungi and symbiotic N-fixing microbes. We found that N-acquisition efficiency is positively correlated with leaf-level photosynthetic capacity and plant growth, and negatively with soil C storage. Plants that associate with ectomycorrhizal fungi and N-fixers may acquire N at a lower cost than plants associated with arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi. However, the additional growth in ectomycorrhizal plants is partly offset by decreases in soil C pools via priming. Collectively, our results indicate that predictive models aimed at quantifying C cycle feedbacks to global change may be improved by treating N as a resource that can be acquired by plants in exchange for energy, with different costs depending on plant interactions with microbial symbionts.",0,0,8.8.2,Soil Carbon

The CMIP6 total ozone RF (1850s to 2000s) is 0.28 +/- 0.17 W m(-2) (which is 80% higher than our CMIP5 estimation), and 0.30 +/- 0.17 W m(-2) out to the present day (2014). The total ozone RF grows rapidly until the 1970s, slows toward the 2000s, and shows a renewed growth thereafter. Since the 1990s the shortwave RF exceeds the longwave RF. Global stratospheric ozone RF is positive between 1930 and 1970 and then turns negative but remains positive in the Northern Hemisphere throughout. Derived stratospheric temperature changes show a localized cooling in the subtropical lower stratosphere due to tropospheric ozone increases and cooling in the upper stratosphere due to ozone depletion by more than 1 K already prior to the satellite era (1980) and by more than 2 K out to the present day (2014).

<br>Plain Language Summary Radiative forcing is a key concept used in climate science to ascertain the strength of different agents, such as greenhouse gases or aerosols among others, in driving climate change. In this context, ozone is recognized as one of the main contributors to radiative forcing according to recent assessments of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. However, the relative uncertainty remains higher than for other greenhouse gases. This paper evaluates the ozone radiative forcing via calculations based on a newly created ozone data set for the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP) phase 6, an initiative designed to better understand past, present, and future climate changes. In general, human activity has led to an increase in ozone concentrations in the lower atmosphere (the troposphere) and decreases in the upper atmosphere (the stratosphere); our paper investigates the effect of both these changes. Our results indicate that the CMIP ozone radiative forcing is 80% larger in the current phase 6 than a similar estimation based on data used in CMIP phase 5. We also present new insights into how ozone changes have led to stratospheric temperature changes, as well as the geographical distribution of ozone radiative forcing.",0,0,9.2.1,Recent Evidence for Historical Period

We find a strengthening of the HC manifested in a ""deep-tropics squeeze"" (DTS), i.e., a deepening and narrowing of the convective zone, enhanced ascent, increased high clouds, suppressed low clouds, and a rise of the level of maximum meridional mass outflow in the upper troposphere (200-100 hPa) of the deep tropics. The DTS induces atmospheric moisture divergence and reduces tropospheric relative humidity in the tropics and subtropics, in conjunction with a widening of the subsiding branches of the HC, resulting in increased frequency of dry events in preferred geographic locations worldwide. Among various water-cycle parameters examined, global dryness is found to have the highest signal-to-noise ratio.

To investigate potential residual confounding, we additionally incorporated next day?s ozone in models with differing temperature control.

Results: Using only a categorical variable for temperature or only controlling nonlinear effect of low temperatures yielded highly significant ozone effects at high temperatures but also significant residual confounding in both regions.

Prior studies have estimated the effects of atmospheric N deposition on temperate forests by leveraging forest inventory measurements across regional gradients in deposition. However, in the United States (U.S.), these previous studies were limited in the number of species and the spatial scale of analysis, and did not include sulfur (S) deposition as a potential covariate. Here, we present a comprehensive analysis of how tree growth and survival for 71 species vary with N and S deposition across the conterminous U.S. Our analysis of 1,423,455 trees from forest plots inventoried between 2000 and 2016 reveals that the growth and/or survival of the vast majority of species in the analysis (n = 66, or 93%) were significantly affected by atmospheric deposition. Species co-occurred across the conterminous U. S. that had decreasing and increasing relationships between growth (or survival) and N deposition, with just over half of species responding negatively in either growth or survival to increased N deposition somewhere in their range (42 out of 71). Averaged across species and conterminous U.S., however, we found that an increase in deposition above current rates of N deposition would coincide with a small net increase in tree growth (1.7% per Delta kg N ha(-1) yr(-1)), and a small net decrease in tree survival (-0.22% per Delta kg N ha(-1) yr(-1)), with substantial regional and among species variation. Adding S as a predictor improved the overall model performance for 70% of the species in the analysis.

Their regional effects on the atmospheric energy budget and circulation can be important for understanding and predicting global and regional precipitation changes, which act on top of the background GHG- induced hydrological changes. Under the framework of the Precipitation Driver Response Model Intercomparison Project (PDRMIP), multiple models were used for the first time to simulate the influence of regional (Asian and European) sulfate and BC forcing on global and regional precipitation. The results show that, as in the case of global aerosol forcing, the global fast precipitation response to regional aerosol forcing scales with global atmospheric absorption, and the slow precipitation response scales with global surface temperature response. Asian sulfate aerosols appear to be a stronger driver of global temperature and precipitation change compared to European aerosols, but when the responses are normalized by unit radiative forcing or by aerosol burden change, the picture reverses, with European aerosols being more efficient in driving global change. The global apparent hydrological sensitivities of these regional forcing experiments are again consistent with those for corresponding global aerosol forcings found in the literature. However, the regional responses and regional apparent hydrological sensitivities do not align with the corresponding global values. Through a holistic approach involving analysis of the energy budget combined with exploring changes in atmospheric dynamics, we provide a framework for explaining the global and regional precipitation responses to regional aerosol forcing.",0,0,9.3.2,Recent Evidence for Other Climate Effects

Our approach contrasts a long present-day control simulation from each model (up to 400 years with perpetual year 2000 or 2005 emissions) with 14 individual aerosol emissions perturbation simulations (160-240 years each). We perturb emissions of sulfur dioxide and/or carbonaceous aerosol within six world regions and assess the significance of precipitation responses relative to internal variability determined by the control simulation and across the models. Global and regional precipitation mostly increases when we reduce regional aerosol emissions in the models, with the strongest responses occurring for sulfur dioxide emissions reductions from Europe and the United States. Precipitation responses to aerosol emissions reductions are largest in the tropics and project onto the El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO). Regressing precipitation onto an Indo-Pacific zonal sea level pressure gradient index (a proxy for ENSO) indicates that the ENSO component of the precipitation response to regional aerosol removal can be as large as 20% of the total simulated response. Precipitation increases in the Sahel in response to aerosol reductions in remote regions because an anomalous interhemispheric temperature gradient alters the position of the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ).

Seedlings were fumigated from mid-May to mid-October in 1992, 1993, and 1994 in standard 3m diameter open-top chambers. The treatments, each replicated three times in a randomized block design, included charcoal-filtered air (CF), 1X ambient O, (1 X), 2X ambient 0, (2X), 2X ambient ozone plus 350 ppm CO, above ambient (2X+C02), and open-air (OA) chamberless plot. Monthly growth and physiological measurements taken during each growing season included stem height and basal diameter, photosynthesis, stomata1 conductance, chlorophyll content, and foliar nitrogen and phosphorus concentration. Subsamples of yellow-poplar were destructively harvested in 1993. First-season exposure to 0, plus CO, appeared to have a stimulatory effect on the growth of both species. In 1993, decreases in white pine height growth, though not significant, were observed for both 2X- and 2X+C02-grown seedlings. Biomass and growth stimulations were observed on yellow-poplar in 1993, with mean increases of 14 percent in stem diameter and 16 percent in total plant height of yellow-poplar grown in 2X+C02 compared with all other treatments. Although not statistically significant at p = 0.05, 2X+C02-grown yellow-poplar had greater leaf, stem, branch and root biomass, and total leaf area compared with all other treatments. NO significant effects on the growth of white pine were observed. However in late August 1 994, both total height and basal stem diameter of 2X+C02-grown yellow-poplar were 2 1 percent greater than for all other treatments. The slower growing white pine appears to be responding differently to O, plus CO, than yellow poplar",0,0,8.2,Visible Foliar Injury and Biomonitoring

We do this both through an understanding of the limitations to ozone uptake (i.e. ozone being transferred from some height in the atmosphere to the leaf boundary layer and subsequent uptake via the stomata) as well as through the internal plant processes that will result in the absorbed ozone dose causing damage and/or injury. We consider these processes across a range of scales by which ozone impacts plants, from cellular metabolism influencing leaf level physiology up to whole canopy and root system processes and feedbacks. We explore how these impacts affect leaf level photosynthesis and senescence (and associated carbon assimilation) as well as whole canopy resource acquisition (e.g. water and nutrients) and ultimately crop growth and yield. We consider these processes from the viewpoint of developing crop growth models capable of incorporating key ozone impact processes within modelling structures that assess crop growth under a variety of different abiotic stresses. These models would provide a dynamic assessment of the impact of ozone within the context of other key variables considered important in determining crop growth and yield. We consider the ability to achieve such modelling through an assessment of the different types of crop model currently available (e.g. empirical, radiation use efficiency, and photosynthesis based crop growth models). Finally, we show how international activities such as the AgMIP (Agricultural Modelling and Improvement Intercomparison Project) could see crop growth modellers collaborate to assess the capabilities of different crop models to simulate the effects of ozone and other stresses. The development of robust crop growth models capable of including ozone effects would substantially improve future national, regional and global risk assessments that aim to assess the role that ozone might play under future climatic conditions in limiting food supply.",0,0,8.1.3,Mechanisms Governing Vegetation Response to Ozone

Significant effort is invested in understanding how pollutants encountered by the lung might induce effects in distant organs. The role of circulating mediators has been predicted; however, their origin and identity have not been confirmed. New evidence has emerged which implicates the role of neuroendocrine sympathetic-adrenal-medullary (SAM) and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) stress axes in mediating a wide array of systemic and pulmonary effects. Our recent studies using ozone exposure as a prototypical air pollutant demonstrate that increases in circulating adrenal-derived stress hormones (epinephrine and cortisol/corticosterone) contribute to lung injury/inflammation and metabolic effects in the liver, pancreas, adipose, and muscle tissues. When stress hormones are depleted by adrenalectomy in rats, most ozone effects including lung injury/inflammation are diminished. Animals treated with antagonists for adrenergic and glucocorticoid receptors show inhibition of the pulmonary and systemic effects of ozone, whereas treatment with agonists restore and exacerbate the ozone-induced injury/inflammation phenotype, implying the role of neuroendocrine activation. The neuroendocrine system is critical for normal homeostasis and allostatic activation; however, chronic exposure to stressors may lead to increases in allostatic load. The emerging mechanisms by which circulating mediators are released and are responsible for producing multiorgan effects of air pollutants insists upon a paradigm shift in the field of air pollution and health. Moreover, since these neuroendocrine responses are linked to both chemical and nonchemical stressors, the interactive influence of air pollutants, lifestyle, and environmental factors requires further study.",0,0,7.2.1.2,Biological Plausibility

Methods: We followed 1,008,253 patients who are 50+-year-old residents in Rome (free from PD) from January 2008 to December 2013. We identified new cases of PD using data from several sources including drug prescriptions and hospital discharges. We estimated exposure at residence using land use regression models for particulate matter and nitrogen oxides, and a chemical dispersion model for summer ozone. We used Cox models (hazard ratio [HR]) to estimate the association between air pollution exposure and incidence of PD, adjusting for individual and contextual variables.

Results: There were 13,104 new cases of PD during the follow-up. There was no evidence of a positive association between particulate matter exposure and PD.

During lung development, the conducting airways are formed first, followed by the formation and enlargement of the gas exchange area. The latter (alveolarization) continues until young adulthood. During organogenesis, the left and right lungs have their own anlage, an outpouching of the foregut. Each lung bud starts a repetitive process of outgrowth and branching (branching morphogenesis) that forms all of the future airways mainly during the pseudoglandular stage. During the canalicular stage, the differentiation of the epithelia becomes visible and the bronchioalveolar duct junction is formed. The location of this junction stays constant throughout life. Towards the end of the canalicular stage, the first gas exchange may take place and survival of prematurely born babies becomes possible. Ninety percent of the gas exchange surface area will be formed by alveolarization, a process where existing airspaces are subdivided by the formation of new walls (septa). This process requires a double-layered capillary network at the basis of the newly forming septum. However, in parallel to alveolarization, the double-layered capillary network of the immature septa fuses to a single-layered network resulting in an optimized setup for gas exchange. Alveolarization still continues, because, at sites where new septa are lifting off preexisting mature septa, the required second capillary layer will be formed instantly by angiogenesis. The latter confirms a lifelong ability of alveolarization, which is important for any kind of lung regeneration.",0,0,3.2.4.2,Lung Function and Development

Number of crown like structures (CLS) and adipocyte size were measured in subcutaneous and visceral adipose tissue of the obese women. Circulating cytokine and free fatty acid (FFA) levels, as well as number and activation status of peripheral leukocytes were determined.<br /><br /><strong>RESULTS: </strong>Obese T2DM subjects showed higher circulating levels of IL-6, FFA and glycerol as compared to obese NGT subjects. Obese T2DM subjects had higher absolute numbers of peripheral leukocytes which were mainly due to an increase of T helper cells. Activation status of circulating cytotoxic T (CD8+CD25+) and B (CD19+CD38+) cells was significantly increased in obese NGT subjects as compared to lean but was not different between the two obese groups.

Increased circulating catecholamine and activation of the different adrenergic receptors deployed in the various organs produce important metabolic responses which include: (1) increased lipolysis and elevated levels of fatty acids in plasma, (2) increased gluconeogenesis by the liver to provide substrate for the brain, and (3) moderate inhibition of insulin release by the pancreas to conserve glucose and to shift fuel metabolism of muscle in the direction of fatty acid oxidation. These physiological responses, typical of the stress conditions, are demonstrated to be detrimental for the functioning of different organs like the cardiac muscle when they become chronic. Indeed, a common feature of many pathological conditions involving over-activation of the adrenergic system is the development of metabolic alterations which can include insulin resistance, altered glucose and lipid metabolism and mitochondrial dysfunction. These patterns are involved with a variably extent among the different pathologies, however, they are in general strictly correlated to the level of activation of the adrenergic system.

IkappaB kinase beta (IKK-beta, encoded by Ikbkb) is a central coordinator of inflammatory responses through activation of NF-kappaB. To understand the role of IKK-beta in insulin resistance, we used mice lacking this enzyme in hepatocytes (Ikbkb(Deltahep)) or myeloid cells (Ikbkb(Deltamye)). Ikbkb(Deltahep) mice retain liver insulin responsiveness, but develop insulin resistance in muscle and fat in response to high fat diet, obesity or aging. In contrast, Ikbkb(Deltamye) mice retain global insulin sensitivity and are protected from insulin resistance. Thus, IKK-beta acts locally in liver and systemically in myeloid cells, where NF-kappaB activation induces inflammatory mediators that cause insulin resistance. These findings demonstrate the importance of liver cell IKK-beta in hepatic insulin resistance and the central role of myeloid cells in development of systemic insulin resistance.

In parallel with the evolution of the homeostasis and stress concepts from ancient Greek to modern medicine, significant advances in the field of neuroendocrinology have identified the physiologic biochemical effector molecules of the stress response. Glucocorticoids, the end-products of the HPA axis, play a fundamental role in the maintenance of both resting and stress-related homeostasis and, undoubtedly, influence the physiologic adaptive reaction of the organism against stressors. If the stress response is dysregulated in terms of magnitude and/or duration, homeostasis is turned into cacostasis with adverse effects on many vital physiologic functions, such as growth, development, metabolism, circulation, reproduction, immune response, cognition and behavior.

Glucocorticoids promote gluconeogenesis in liver, whereas in skeletal muscle and white adipose tissue they decrease glucose uptake and utilization by antagonizing insulin response. Therefore, excess glucocorticoid exposure causes hyperglycemia and insulin resistance. Glucocorticoids also regulate glycogen metabolism. In liver, glucocorticoids increase glycogen storage, whereas in skeletal muscle they play a permissive role for catecholamine-induced glycogenolysis and/or inhibit insulin-stimulated glycogen synthesis. Moreover, glucocorticoids modulate the function of pancreatic ? and ? cells to regulate the secretion of glucagon and insulin, two hormones that play a pivotal role in the regulation of blood glucose levels.

The role of ERbeta is still unknown, yet ERalpha plays an important role in the regulation of insulin biosynthesis, insulin secretion and beta-cell survival. Activation of ERalpha by 17beta-estradiol (E2) and the environmental estrogen bisphenol-A (BPA) promotes an increase of insulin biosynthesis through a non-classical estrogen-activated pathway that involves phosphorylation of ERK1/2. The activation of ERalpha by physiological concentrations of E2 may play an important role in the adaptation of the endocrine pancreas to pregnancy. However, if ERalpha is over stimulated by an excess of E2 or the action of an environmental estrogen such as BPA, it will produce an excessive insulin signaling.

Subjects who were not euthyroid were excluded, as were subjects taking thyroid medication, medication for diabetes, and subjects for whom medication data were not available (n = 1122). Homeostasis model assessment for insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) (mU*mmol/liter2) was calculated as fasting insulin (mU/liter) times fasting glucose (mmol/liter) divided by 22.5. The metabolic syndrome was defined according to National Cholesterol Education Program's Adult Treatment Panel III criteria. After adjustment for age and sex, free T4 (FT4) was significantly associated with total cholesterol [standardized beta (beta) = -0.059; P = 0.014], low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (beta = -0.068; P = 0.004), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (beta = 0.100; P < 0.001), and triglycerides (beta = -0.102; P < 0.001).

Excessive cholesterol is removed by the reverse cholesterol transport (RCT) pathway, representing a major antiatherogenic mechanism. In addition to the RCT, other pathways are required for maintaining the whole-body cholesterol homeostasis. Thus, we propose a working model of integrated cholesterol transport, termed the cholesterol transport system (CTS), to describe body cholesterol metabolism. The novel model not only involves the classical view of RCT but also contains other steps, such as cholesterol absorption in the small intestine, low-density lipoprotein uptake by the liver, and transintestinal cholesterol excretion. Extensive studies have shown that dysfunctional CTS is one of the major causes for hypercholesterolemia and atherosclerosis. Currently, several drugs are available to improve the CTS efficiently. There are also several therapeutic approaches that have entered into clinical trials and shown considerable promise for decreasing the risk of CVD. In recent years, a variety of novel findings reveal the molecular mechanisms for the CTS and its role in the development of atherosclerosis, thereby providing novel insights into the understanding of whole-body cholesterol transport and metabolism.

Ghrelin-producing cells constitute a distinct group of endocrine cells dispersed throughout the gastric mucosa and to a lesser extent in the small intestine and the endocrine pancreas. Ghrelin plasma levels rise during fasting and chronic caloric restriction to stimulate food intake and fat storage and to prevent life-threatening falls in blood glucose. Plasma ghrelin levels decrease after a meal is consumed and in conditions of energy surplus (such as obesity). Ghrelin has emerged as a key player in the regulation of appetite and energy homeostasis. Ghrelin achieves these functions through binding the ghrelin receptor GHS-R in appetite-regulating neurons and in peripheral metabolic organs including the endocrine pancreas. Ghrelin levels are negatively correlated with body mass index (BMI) and insulin resistance. In addition, ghrelin secretion is impaired in obesity and insulin resistance. Several studies highlight an important role for ghrelin in glucose homeostasis. Genetic, immunological, and pharmacological blockade of ghrelin signaling resulted in improved glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity. Furthermore, exogenous ghrelin administration was shown to decrease glucose-induced insulin release and increase glucose level in both humans and rodents. GHS-R was shown to be expressed in pancreatic ?-cells and ghrelin suppressed insulin release via a Ca2+-mediated pathway.

Among the classic regulators of lipolysis, adrenergic stimulation and the insulin-mediated control of lipid mobilisation are the best known. Initially, hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL) was thought to be the rate-limiting enzyme of the first lipolytic step, while we now know that adipocyte TAG lipase is the key enzyme for lipolysis initiation. Pivotal, previously unsuspected components have also been identified at the protective interface of the lipid droplet surface and in the signalling pathways that control lipolysis. Perilipin, comparative gene identification-58 (CGI-58) and other proteins of the lipid droplet surface are currently known to be key regulators of the lipolytic machinery, protecting or exposing the TAG core of the droplet to lipases. The neuroendocrine control of lipolysis is prototypically exerted by catecholaminergic stimulation and insulin-induced suppression, both of which affect cyclic AMP levels and hence the protein kinase A-mediated phosphorylation of HSL and perilipin. Interestingly, in recent decades adipose tissue has been shown to secrete a large number of adipokines, which exert direct effects on lipolysis, while adipocytes reportedly express a wide range of receptors for signals involved in lipid mobilisation. Recently recognised mediators of lipolysis include some adipokines, structural membrane proteins, atrial natriuretic peptides, AMP-activated protein kinase and mitogen-activated protein kinase.

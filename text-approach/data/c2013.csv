Antioxidants were exposed individually and as a composite mixture, with and without human albumin to a range of ambient O3 concentrations: 0-1500 ppb using a continually mixed, interfacial exposure setup. We observed the following: (1) UA constituted the most o3-reactive substrate in each of the models examined. Reactivity hierarchies  in each were as follows: UA > AA >> GSH (individual antioxidant), UA > AA > GSH (composite antioxidant), and UA >> AA approximately equal to GSH (composite antioxidant + albumin). Consumption of  GSH as a pure antioxidant solution was associated with a 2:1 stoichiometric conversion of GSH to GSSG. This simplistic relationship was lost in the more complex models. (3) Consumption of antioxidants by O3 occurred without alteration of sample pH. (4) Protein carbonyl formation was observed when albumin alone was exposed to O3. However, in the presence of the composite antioxidant solution no evidence of this oxidative modification was apparent. These data indicate that GSH does not represent an important substrate for O3. In contrast, UA displays high reactivity consistent with its acting as a sacrificial substrate in the ELF. As UA concentrations are highest in the ELF of the proximal airways, its localization, allied to its reactivity, suggesting that it plays important roles, both in conferring protection locally and also by ""scrubbing"" O3, from inhaled air, limiting its penetration to the more sensitive distal lung.",5.2.3,Ozone Reactions and Reaction Products,0,0

Over a 15-year period, 3.2% of males and 4.3% of females reported new doctor diagnoses of asthma. For males, we observed a significant relationship between report of doctor diagnosis of asthma and 20-year mean 8-h average ambient ozone concentration (relative risk (RR) = 2.09 for a 27 ppb increase in ozone concentration, 95% CI = 1.03 to 4.16). We observed no such relationship for females. Other variables significantly related to development of asthma were a history of ever-smoking for males (HR = 237, 95% CI = 1.13 to 4.81), and for females, number of years worked with a smoker (RR  1.21 for a 7-year increment, 95% CI = 1.04 to 1.39), age (RH = 0.61 for a 16-year increment, 95% CI = 0.44 to 0.84), and a history of childhood pneumonia or
bronchitis (RH = 2.96, 95% CI = 1.68 to 5.03). Addition of other pollutants (PM10, SO4, NO2, and SO2) to the models did not diminish the relationship between ozone and asthma for males. These data suggest that long-term exposure to ambient ozone is associated with development of asthma in adult males.",4.3.4.1,Personal Exposure to Ozone and Copollutants,3.2.4.1.1,Epidemiologic Studies

Fifteen (six male; mean age, 31.1 ? 2.1 yr) healthy nonsmokers were exposed to 400 parts per billion (ppb) ozone for 2 h with intermittent exercise. Spirometry, exhaled carbon monoxide (CO) and nitric oxide (NO) levels, measurement of methacholine reactivity, and collection of exhaled air condensate and induced sputum
samples were performed at baseline, preexposure, and at intervals up to 24 h postexposure. Ozone exposure led to significant decreases in spirometry and increased methacholine reactivity and sputum neutrophils and myeloperoxidase (MPO). There were no changes in exhaled NO and CO levels, or exhaled breath nitrite after ozone exposure. There were no differences in any of the parameters after treatment with budesonide compared with placebo, and no differences in the response to ozone

We sought to determine whether mast cell degranulation is induced by in vivo exposure to O3 in mice and whether mast cells play an essential role in the development of pulmonary pathophysiological alterations induced by O3. For this we exposed mast cell-deficient WBB6F1-kit W /kit W-v (kit W /kit W-v ) mice and the congenic normal WBB6F1 (1/1) mice to air or to 1 or 3 parts/million O3 for 4 h and studied them at different intervals from 4 to 72 h later. We found evidence of O3-induced cutaneous, as well as bronchial, mast cell degranulation. Polymorphonuclear cell influx into the pulmonary parenchyma was observed after exposure to 1 part/milllion O3 only in mice that possessed mast cells. Airway hyperresponsiveness to intravenous methacholine measured in vivo under pentobarbital anesthesia was observed in both kit W /kit W-v and 1/1 mice after exposure toO3. Thus, although mast cells are activated in vivo by O3 and participate in O3-induced polymorphonuclear cell infiltration into the pulmonary parenchyma, they do not participate detectably in the development of O3-induced airway hyperresponsiveness in mice.",5.4.2.2,Pre existing Diseases and Conditions,0,0

Platelet-activating factor (PAF) is a lipid mediator released by activated mast cells, macrophages, and epithelial cells and causes pulmonary inflammation and hyperpermeability. We hypothesized that the activation of PAF receptors is central to the development of inflammation and epithelial injury induced by acute O3 exposure in mice. To test this hypothesis, O3-susceptible C57BL/6J mice were treated with a PAF-receptor antagonist, UK-74505, or vehicle either before or immediately after 3-h exposure to O3 (2 parts/million) or filtered air. Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluids were collected 6 and 24 h after exposure. Differential cell counts and protein content of the lavage were used as indicators of inflammation in the airways. O3-induced epithelial injury was assessed by light microscopy, and DNA synthesis in epithelium of terminal bronchioles was estimated by using a bromodeoxyuridine-labeling index. Intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1)expression was also examined in the lung by immunohistochemical localization. O3 caused significant increases in polymorphonuclear leukocytes and protein in the BAL fluid, increased pulmonary epithelial proliferation, and increased epithelial expression of ICAM-1 compared with air-exposed, vehicle-treated control mice. Relative to O3-exposed, vehicle-treated control mice, UK-74505 before exposure significantly (P < 0.05) decreased BAL protein, polymorphonuclear leukocytes, and epithelial cells. O3-induced inflammation was similarly attenuated in mice treated with UK-74505 after exposure. These experiments thus support the hypothesis that O3-induced airways inflammation and epithelial damage in mice are partially mediated by activation of PAF receptors, possibly through modulation of ICAM-1 expression.",5.3.3,Initiation of inflammation,0,0

Two bronchoscopes were inserted through an endotracheal tube in anesthetized, mechanically ventilated, mixed breeddogs and were wedged into sublobar bronchi located in the right and left lower lobes, respectively. Segments were ventilated via the bronchoscope with 5% CO2 in air delivered at 200 ml/min, and an aerosol of 99m Tc-DTPA was generated and delivered through the scope and into the sublobar segment over a 30-s period. Clearance of 99m Tc-DTPA was measured simultaneously from right and left lower lung segments at baseline and 1, 7, and 14 days after a 6-h sublobar exposure to filtered air or 400 parts per billion O3. O3 treatment significantly decreased the clearance halftime (t50)of 99m Tc-DTPA by 50% from the baseline mean of 32.3 to 16.0 min at 1 day postexposure. After 7 days of recovery, t50 was still reduced by 28.8%; however, by 14 days postexposure, clearance of 99m Tc-DTPA had recovered, and the t50 had a mean value of 30.0 min. 99m Tc-DTPA clearance was not altered by exposure to filtered air, and t50 values were comparable to baseline at 1, 7, and 14 days postexposure. These results reveal that a single local exposure to O3 increases transepithelial clearance, but only for epithelia directly exposed to O3, and that 7-14 days of recovery are required before permeability to small-molecular-weight solutes returns to normal.",5.3.4,Alteration of Epithelial Barrier Function,0,0

We have recently reported that long-term inhalation exposure to ozone causes mucous-cell metaplasia (MCM) in the surface epithelium lining the nasal airways of F344 rats. The principal objective of the present study was to determine the persistence of ozone-induced MCM in the nasal epithelium after the end of a chronic exposure. Male F344/N rats were exposed to 0, 0.25, or 0.5 ppm ozone, for 8 h/d, 7 d/wk for 13 wk. Animals were killed 8 h, 4 wk, or 13 wk after the end of the chronic exposure. Ozone-related alterations in the nasal epithelium were qualitatively and quantitatively characterized through histochemistry, image analysis, and morphometric techniques. Some rats were exposed for an additional 8 h to 0.5 ppm ozone at 13 wk after the end of the chronic exposure to determine whether previous ozone exposure results in persistent changes in the sensitivity of nasal epithelium to acute injury. At the end of the chronic exposure, hyperplasia was present in the nasal epithelium of rats exposed to 0.25 and 0.5 ppm ozone. By 13 wk postexposure, this proliferative alteration was still evident only in the rats exposed to 0.5 ppm ozone. Ozone-induced MCM with associated intraepithelial mucosubstances was evident only in the nasal tissues of rats exposed to 0.5 ppm ozone. Though attenuated, these alterations in the nasal mucous apparatus were still detectable at 13 wk after the end of the exposure. At this same time after the chronic exposure, an acute (8 h) exposure to 0.5 ppm ozone induced an additional increase of mucosubstances in the nasal epithelium of rats previously exposed to 0.5 ppm ozone, but not in rats chronically exposed to 0 or 2.5 ppm ozone. The persistent nature of the ozone-induced MCM in rats documented in this report suggests that ozone exposure may have the potential to induce similar long-lasting alterations in the airways of humans.",5.3.7,Airways Remodeling,0,0

The aim of this study was thus to investigate the interaction between passive sensitization and exposure to pollutants in human isolated airways. We have examined (1) the effect of a preexposure to pollutants on the contraction of sensitized bronchi to a specific antigen, and (2) the effect of passive sensitization on the contraction to nonspecific agonists in bronchi preexposed to pollutants. In tissues sensitized by incubation in sera from asthmatic patients, preexposure to 0.3 mM acrolein (an aldehyde) for 10 min or 20 min significantly increased the maximal contractile response to the antigen Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus (D. Pter.) by 20.5 +/- 6.5 and 34.9 +/- 7.4%, respectively. Similarly, preexposure to ozone(1 ppm for 20 min) increased the response to D. pter. by 25.3 +/- 11.3%. On the other hand, passive sensitization increased the contractile response to carbachol or histamine of bronchial rings preexposed to 0.3 mM acrolein for 10 min by 33.5 +/- 6.2% and 32.5 +/- 5.1%, respectively. This study provides a proof of principle in vitro for a combined effect of immunological sensitization and exposure to pollutants, i.e., passive sensitization and exposure to pollutants act in a synergistic manner on human bronchial smooth muscle reactivity in response to both specific antigen and nonspecific agonists.",5.4.2.2,Pre existing Diseases and Conditions,0,0

Thirteen healthy nonsmoking subjects were exposed in a single blinded, crossover control fashion to 0.2 parts per million (ppm) O3 and filtered air for 2 h, using a standard intermittent exercise and rest protocol. Lung function was assessed pre- and immediately post-exposure. Bronchoscopy was performed with endobronchial mucosal biopsies, bronchial wash (BW) and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) 1.5 h after the end of the exposure period. Respiratory tract lining fluid (RTLF) redox status was assessed by measuring a range of antioxidants and oxidative damage markers in BW and BAL fluid samples. There was a significant upregulation after 03 exposure in the expression of vascular endothelial P-selectin (p<0.005) and intercellular adhesion molecule-i (p<0.005). This was associated with a 2-fold increase in submucosal mast cells (p<O.005) in biopsy samples, without evidence of neutrophilic inflammation, and a decrease in HAL fluid macrophage numbers (1.6-fold, p<0.005), with an activation of the remaining macrophage subset (2.5-fold increase in % human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-DR+ cells, p<0.005). In addition, exposure led to a 4.5-fold and 3.1-fold increase of reduced glutathione (GSH) concentrations, in BW and BAL fluid respectively (p<0.05), with alterations in urate and a-tocopherol plasmalRTLF partitioning ratios (p<0.05). Spirometry showed reductions in forced vital capacity (p<0.0S) and forced expiratory volume in one second (p<0.01), with evidence of small airway narrowing using forced expiratory flow values (p<0.005). Evidence was found of O3-induced early adhesion molecule upregulation, increased submucosal mast cell numbers and alterations to the respiratory tract lining fluid redox status. No clear relationship was demonstrable between changes in these early markers and the lung function decrements observed. The results therefore indicate that the initial lung function decrements are not predictive of, or causally related to the O3-induced inflammatory events in normal human subjects.",5.2.3,Ozone Reactions and Reaction Products,0,0

Nasal lavage was performed and blood samples obtained at four time points throughout each exposure: pre-exposure (Pre-E), 1 h into exposure (l h-E), immediately post-exposure (0h-PE) and 1 h post-exposure (l h-PE). Endobronchial mucosal biopsies were obtained at 1.5 h-post exposure (1.5 h-PE). Nasal RTLF neutrophilia was not apparent during, or 1.5 h after, O3 exposure. Furthermore, activation of the pre-existing neutrophil population did not occur. Airway permeability was not altered by this O3 exposure regimen. Sequential lavage resulted in significant washout of RTLF ascorbic acid, reduced glutathione, extracellular superoxide dismutase and myeloperoxidase at l h-E, 0 h-PE and 1.5 h-PE relative to baseline Pre-E values. In contrast, RTLF uric acid (UA), total protein and albumin concentrations did not display washout kinetics. Of the antioxidants examined, only UA was clearly depleted by O3, concentrations, falling by 6.22 ""mu""mol L-1 at l h-E, compared with 1.61 ""mu""mol L-1 (p<0.0l) during control air exposure. The establishment of a new pseudo-steady-state concentration of RTLF UA (70% of Pre-E values) during the second hour of O3 exposure was coincident with a small but significant increase in plasma UA concentration (19.27 (O3) versus 1.95 ""mu""mol L-1(air), p<0.05). These data demonstrate that inhalation of 0.2 parts per million O3 results in the depletion of nasal respiratory tract lining fluid uric acid and that this regional loss of uric acid leads to a small increase in plasma uric acid concentration. Whilst the reaction of uric acid with inspired O3 may confer protection locally, the role of upper airway uric acid as a sink for inhaled O3 is not supported by these findings.",5.2.3,Ozone Reactions and Reaction Products,0,0

A study to characterize 1-hr multi-pollutant exposures was performed in Baltimore, MD, during the summer of 1998 and the winter of 1999, and was conducted over a 15-day period in each of the two seasons. Personal exposures were measured by a trained field technician, who wore a newly developed Roll-Around System (RAS) to measure 1-hr PM2.5 and gaseous (CO, O3, NO2, SO2, volatile organic compounds [VOCs]) exposures. One-hour O3, NO2, and SO2 personal exposures were measured using samplers developed in our laboratory, while short-term PM2.5, CO, and VOCs exposures were measured using currently available monitors. All 1-hr multi-pollutant exposures were measured while the technician performed pre-determined activities, beginning at 7:00 a.m. and ending at 7:00 p.m. of the same day. Activities were scripted to simulate activities performed by older adults (65+ years of age). Corresponding 1-hr ambient pollutant concentrations were obtained from federal or state monitoring networks. In this paper, we discuss the results from our study and present our descriptive analysis of the 1-hr personal particulate and gaseous exposure data. Personal PM2.5, O3, CO, and VOCs exposures showed substantial variability over the 12-hr sampling periods. Multiple pairwise com-parison tests showed that 1-hr personal O3 exposures were significantly lower in indoor microenvironments as compared with outdoor microenvironments. One-hour personal CO exposures measured in vehicles were significantly higher than those measured in other microenvironments. The associations between 1-hr personal exposures and corresponding ambient concentrations differed by pollutant and by microenvironment. For example, the correlation between personal PM2.5 exposures and ambient concentrations was lowest (r s = 0.36, p < 0.05) in the winter for in-door non-residential microenvironments, and was highest (r s = 0.90, p < 0.05) in the winter for in-vehicle microenvironments. For O3, the correlation between personal exposures and ambient levels was weakest in the winter for residential microenvironments (r s = 0.05, p > 0.05), and was strongest in the summer for outdoor near-roadway microenvironments (r s = 0.91, p < 0.05). Implications: Several recent studies have demonstrated associations between short-term ambient air pollutant concentrations and a variety of adverse respiratory and cardiovascular effects. Despite this, few studies have characterized short-term air pollutant exposures, and none of these studies have examined the relationship among short-term personal particulate and gaseous exposures. This paper describes a new personal ""roll-around"" monitor, which was used to measure 1-hr personal PM2.5 , CO, O3, and VOCs exposures simultaneously. In addition, this paper characterizes the magnitude and variability in 1-hr personal particulate and gaseous exposures and examines associations between these exposures and corresponding ambient levels. Results from this study could help to interpret results from epidemiologic studies and to better assess the health impacts of complex mixtures of air pollutant exposures.",4.3.3,Personal-Ambient Concentration Relationships,0,0

In an effort to make the indirect exposure assessment approach more accessible to people in the health and risk assessment fields, this paper provides examples using real data from a) a week-long personal carbon monoxide monitoring survey conducted by the author; and b) the 1992 to 1994 National Human Activity Pattern Survey (NHAPS) for the United States. The indirect approach uses measurements of exposures in specific microenvironments (e.g., homes, bars, offices), validated microenvironmental models (based on the mass balance equation), and human activity pattern data obtained from questionnaires to predict frequency distributions of exposure for entire populations. This approach requires fewer resources than the direct approach to exposure assessment, for which the distribution of monitors to a representative sample of a given population is necessary. In the indirect exposure assessment approach, average microenvironmental concentrations are multiplied by the total time spent in each microenvironment to give total integrated exposure. By assuming that the concentrations encountered in each of 10 location categories are the same for different members of the U.S. population (i.e., the NHAPS respondents), the hypothetical contribution that ETS makes to the average 24-hr respirable suspended particle exposure for Americans working their main job is calculated in this paper to be 18 microg/m3.

Ozone exposure causes acute decrements in pulmonary function, increases airway responsiveness, and changes the breathing pattern. We examined these responses in 19 ozone-responsive (DeltaFEV(1) > 5%) young females exposed to both air and 0.35 ppm ozone. The randomized 75-min exposures included two 30-min exercise periods at V(E) approximately 40 L/min. Responses were measured before, during, and after exposure and at 18 and 42 h postexposure. FVC, FEV(1), and FIV(0.5) decreased (p <.01) immediately postexposure by 13.2%, 19.9%, and 20.8%, respectively, and the airway responsiveness was significantly increased. Raw increased (p <.05), while TGV remained essentially unchanged. At 18 h postexposure, the airways were still hyperresponsive and FEV(1) and FIV(0.5) were still 5% below the preexposure levels. There were no residual effects in any of the variables at 42 h postexposure. During exercise in ozone the tidal volume was decreased (-14%) and respiratory frequency increased (+15%). The changes in airway responsiveness were not related to changes in spirometric measurements. We found no significant differences between postair and postozone mouth occlusion pressure (Pm(0.1)) and the hypercapnic response to CO(2) rebreathing. We conclude that ozone induced typical acute changes in airway responsiveness and that ventilatory (exercise), spirometric (inspiratory and expiratory), and plethysmographic pulmonary function may show some residual effects for up to 18 h after exposure.

During each sampling period, the children recorded time-location-activity information in a diary. Ambient ozone concentration data were obtained from air quality monitoring stations in the study areas. We present ozone concentration data for she ozone season (June-September 1995 and May 1996) and the nonozone season (October 1995-April 1996). During the ozone season, outdoor and indoor concentrations and personal exposure averaged 48.2, 11.8, and 18.8 ppb in Upland and 60.1, 21.4, and 25.4 ppb in the mountain towns, respectively. During the nonoxone season, outdoor and indoor concentrations and personal exposure averaged 21.1, 3.2, and 6.2 ppb in Upland, and 35.7, 2.8, and 5.7 ppb in the mountain towns, respectively.

The sampler measured simultaneous 24-hr integrated personal exposures to PM25, PM10, SO4 2-, O3, NO2, SO2, and exhaust-related VOCs.

Results of this study showed that longitudinal associations between ambient PM2.5 concentrations and corresponding personal exposures tended to be high in the summer (median Spearman's r = 0.74) and low in the winter (median Spearman's r = 0.25). Indoor ventilation was an important determinant of personal PM2.5 exposures and resulting personal-ambient associations. Associations between personal PM25 exposures and corresponding ambient concentrations were strongest for well-ventilated indoor environments and decreased with ventilation. This decrease was attributed to the increasing influence of indoor PM2 5 sources. Evidence for this was provided by SO4 2-measurements, which can be thought of as a tracer for ambient PM25. For SO4 2-, personal-ambient associations were strong even in poorly ventilated indoor environments, suggesting that personal exposures to PM2.5 of ambient origin are strongly associated with corresponding ambient concentrations. The results also indicated that the contribution of indoor PM2.5 sources to personal PM2.5 exposures was lowest when individuals spent the majority of their time in well-ventilated indoor environments.

Results also indicate that the potential for confounding by PM2.5 co-pollutants is limited, despite significant correlations among ambient pollutant concentrations. In contrast to ambient concentrations, PM2.5 exposures were not significantly correlated with personal exposures to PM2.5-10, PM2.5 of non-ambient origin, O3, NO2, and SO2. Since a confounder must be associated with the exposure of interest, these results provide evidence that the effects observed in the PM2.5 epidemiologic studies are unlikely to be due to confounding by the PM2.5 co-pollutants measured in this study.",4.3.3,Personal-Ambient Concentration Relationships,2.2,Exposure Concepts

For many agents of interest, exposures take place over time and in multiple locations; accurately estimating the relevant exposures for an individual participant in epidemiologic studies is often daunting, particularly within the limits set by feasibility, participant burden, and cost. Researchers have taken steps to deal with the consequences of measurement error by limiting the degree of error through a study's design, estimating the degree of error using a nested validation study, and by adjusting for measurement error in statistical analyses. In this paper, we address measurement error in observational studies of air pollution and health. Because measurement error may have substantial implications for interpreting epidemiologic studies on air pollution, particularly the time-series analyses, we developed a systematic conceptual formulation of the problem of measurement error in epidemiologic studies of air pollution and then considered the consequences within this formulation. When possible, we used available relevant data to make simple estimates of measurement error effects. This paper provides an overview of measurement errors in linear regression, distinguishing two extremes of a continuum-Berkson from classical type errors, and the univariate from the multivariate predictor case. We then propose one conceptual framework for the evaluation of measurement errors in the log-linear regression used for time-series studies of particulate air pollution and mortality and identify three main components of error. We present new simple analyses of data on exposures of particulate matter < 10 ""mu""m in aerodynamic diameter from the Particle Total Exposure Assessment Methodology Study.

Because human activities impact the timing, location, and degree of pollutant exposure, they play a key role in explaining exposure variation. This fact has motivated the collection of activity pattern data for their specific use in exposure assessments. The largest of these recent efforts is the National Human Activity Pattern Survey (NHAPS), a 2-year probability-based telephone survey (n=9386) of exposure-related human activities in the United States (U.S.) sponsored by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). The primary purpose of NHAPS was to provide comprehensive and current exposure information over broad geographical and temporal scales, particularly for use in probabilistic population exposure models. NHAPS was conducted on a virtually daily basis from late September 1992 through September 1994 by the University of Maryland's Survey Research Center using a computer-assisted telephone interview instrument (CATI) to collect 24-h retrospective diaries and answers to a number of personal and exposure-related questions from each respondent. The resulting diary records contain beginning and ending times for each distinct combination of location and activity occurring on the diary day (i.e., each microenvironment). Between 340 and 1713 respondents of all ages were interviewed in each of the 10 EPA regions across the 48 contiguous states. Interviews were completed in 63% of the households contacted. NHAPS respondents reported spending an average of 87% of their time in enclosed buildings and about 6% of their time in enclosed vehicles. These proportions are fairly constant across the various regions of the U.S. and Canada and for the California population between the late 1980s, when the California Air Resources Board (CARB) sponsored a state-wide activity pattern study, and the mid-1990s, when NHAPS was conducted. However, the number of people exposed to environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) in California seems to have decreased over the same time period, where exposure is determined by the reported time spent with a smoker. In both California and the entire nation, the most time spent exposed to ETS was reported to take place in residential locations.",4.4.1,Activity Patterns,0,0

To define patterns of acute epithelial injury along intrapulmonary airways, we developed a new analytic approach incorporating labeling of permeable cells, airway microdissection, and laser scanning confocal microscopy, and applied it to isolated perfused rat lungs where ventilation and breathing pattern could be controlled. After exposure to O3 (0, 0.25, 0.5, or 1.0 ppm), lungs were lavaged to assess lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and protein, or infused with the permeability marker ethidium homodimer- 1 (EffiD- 1) via tracheal cannula, gently lavaged, and fixed by airway infusion. The airway tree of the right middle lobe was exposed by microdissection of the axial pathwaf down to the terminal bronchioles; the dissection was incubated with a second nuclear dye, YOPRO- 1, to label all nuclei; and whole mounts were examined by confocal microscopy. Abundance of EthD-l-positive (injured) cells was estimated as the number per epithelial volume using stereology on Z-series of projected images. For ozone concentrations of 1.0 ppm, lavage fluid LDH and total protein did not increase over controls. Exposure produced a concentration-dependent but nonhomogeneous increase in the abundance of EthD-l-labeled cells in proximal and distal conducting airways both in the main pathway, including terminal bronchioles, and in side branches. Overall, the highest EthD-1 labeling occurred in the side branches of the most proximal part of the airway tree at 1 ppm with the adjacent axial pathway airway having approximately one-third the labeling density. Density of EthD-l-labeled cells was lowest in terminal bronchioles at all O3 doses.

This paper discusses the legal and scientific reasons for separating personal exposure to PM into ambient and nonambient components. It then demonstrates by several examples how well-established models and data typically obtained in exposure field studies can be used to estimate both individual and community average expo-sure to ambient-generated PM (ambient PM outdoors plus ambient PM that has infiltrated indoors), indoor-generated PM, and personal activity PM. Ambient concentrations are not highly correlated with personal exposure to nonambient PM or total PM but are highly correlated with personal exposure to ambient-generated PM. Therefore, ambient concentrations may be used in epidemiology as an appropriate surrogate for personal exposure to ambient-generated PM. Suggestions are offered as to how exposure to ambient-generated PM may be obtained and used in epidemiology and risk assessment. Implications: Exposure analysts historically have sought to determine the total personal exposure to PM of all types in all environments. The lack of correlation between this parameter and ambient PM concentration has been considered an impediment to epidemiologic studies seeking to find an association between ambient PM concentrations and health outcomes. For community, time-series epidemiology, it is necessary only that the community average personal exposure to ambient-generated PM be correlated with the ambient PM concentration. If everyone spent the same amount of time outside and in each microenvironment each day, and the air exchange rate and any forced-air ventilation that resulted in particle removal was a constant, and PM concentrations were uniform across the community, a high correlation would be expected between the PM concentration measured by a community-based PM monitor and the personal exposure of each individual to ambient-generated PM. Also, a high correla-tion would be expected between ambient concentration and the exposure surrogate of interest in epidemiology, the community average personal exposure to ambient-generated PM. For short-term panel studies, time-series should be determined for all classes of PM. For cohort studies of long-term effects, consideration must be given to the influence of possible variations in exposures to nonambient-generated PM because of differences among cities in time-location patterns (fractions of time spent outdoors), average air exchange rates, and average concentrations of indoor-generated and personal activity PM.",4.2,General Exposure Concepts,0,0

Ozone is a powerful oxidant and toxic air pollutant. As a gaseous pollutant, its primary target tissue is the lung and breathing slightly elevated concentrations of ozone results in a range of respiratory symptoms. These include decreased lung function and increased airway hyper-reactivity in 10-20% of the healthy population. Moreover, those with conditions such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) generally experience an exacerbation of their symptoms. Together, these observations suggest that certain individuals are particularly susceptible to this oxidant gas. The primary goal of this review is to examine the basis of this increased sensitivity. Ozone is a highly reactive gas that is consumed by reactive processes on reaching the first interface in the lung, the lung lining fluid compartment. Reactions between ozone and antioxidants tend to dominate in this compartment and these are generally thought of as beneficial, or protective interactions. In those instances when ozone reacts with other substrates in lung lining fluid such as protein or lipid, secondary oxidation products arise which transmit the toxic signals to the underlying pulmonary epithelium. The rules that govern the balance between beneficial and detrimental interactions in the lung lining fluid compartment are not well established but these may contribute, in part, to sensitivity. On reaching the lung surface, secondary oxidation products arising from ozone initiate a number of cellular responses. These include cytokine generation, adhesion molecule expression and tight junction modification. Together, these responses lead to the influx of inflammatory cells to the lung in the absence of a pathogenic challenge. Moreover, lung permeability is increased and oedema develops. The nature and extent of these responses are variable and often not related within an individual. Thus, although an improved appreciation of the general mechanism of action of ozone has been attained in recent years, the basis for individual susceptibility is still unclear.",5.3.2,Activation of Neural Reflexes,0,0

Although C, MV, and T all had statistically significant effects on FA (P < 0.0001, P = 0.004, and P = 0.026, respectively), the magnitudes of these effects were small compared with intersubject variability.

Dogs were either untreated or pre-treated with probenecid (an anion-transport inhibitor) and exposed for 6 h to 0.2parts/million O3. Peripheral airway resistance (Rpa) and reactivity (DRpa) were monitored in three sublobar locations before and after exposure to either air or O3. Pulmonary resistance and transepithelial potentialdifference in trachea and bronchus were also recorded. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) was collected before, during, and after exposure. O3 increased Rpa and DRpa only in probenecid-treated dogs and in a location-dependent fashion.

Firstly, directly as a consequence of its oxidising character during exposure, and secondly, indirectly by engendering inflammation. In this study the second pathway was considered by ascertaining the impact of O3 on the redox state of the fluid lining the respiratory tract 6 hours after challenge. METHODS: Nine subjects were exposed in a double blind crossover control trial to air and 200 ppb O3 for 2 hours with an intermittent exercise and rest protocol. Blood samples were obtained and lung function (forced vital capacity (FVC), forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1))   assessed before, immediately after, and 6 hours after exposure. Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL)   was performed 6 hours after challenge. Inflammation was assessed in BAL fluid (total and differential cell counts, plus myeloperoxidase concentrations), and plasma and BAL fluid redox   state were determined by measuring concentrations of antioxidants and markers of oxidative   damage. RESULTS: Neutrophil numbers in BAL fluid increased 2.2-fold (p = 0.07) 6 hours after exposure and this was accompanied by increased myeloperoxidase concentrations in BAL   fluid (p = 0.08). On the other hand, BAL fluid macrophage and lymphocyte numbers decreased   2.5-fold (p = 0.08) and 3.1-fold (p = 0.08), respectively at this time. Of the antioxidants examined, only ascorbate in BAL fluid was affected by O3, falling in all subjects relative to air values (0.1 (0.0-0.3) v 0.3 (0.2-1.2) mumol/l (p = 0.008)). A marginal decrease in plasma ascorbate was also detected at this time (p < 0.05). Although the decrease in macrophage numbers seemed to be causally related to the increase in neutrophils (R = -0.79), myeloperoxidase concentrations (R = -0.93) and ascorbate concentrations (R = 0.6), no clear associations were apparent between ascorbate changes and neutrophils or myeloperoxidase concentration after O3. CONCLUSIONS: Ascorbate in the fluid lining the respiratory tract is   depleted as a consequence of O3 exposure at 6 hours after exposure. This was contemporaneous with, although not quantitatively related to the increase in neutrophil numbers and myeloperoxidase concentrations. Decreased macrophage numbers 6 hours after O3 related to the degree of neutrophilic inflammation with populations conserved where ascorbate   concentration in the fluid lining the respiratory tract were high after exposure. These results imply  that ascorbate has a critical protective role against inflammatory oxidative stress induced by O3.",5.2.3,Ozone Reactions and Reaction Products,0,0

METHODS: Enrolled children recorded peak expiratory flow rates (PEFR) twice daily. We obtained air pollution, meteorological and pollen data. In all, 125 children remained in the final analysis.

The association was stronger in a subgroup of children with bronchial hyperreactivity and a doctor diagnosis of asthma (beta-coefficient = -2.61; P = 0.001). There was no significant association between PEFR and same-day daily daytime maximum ozone concentration. We also demonstrated a dose-response relationship with mean daytime ozone concentration.

Further, in prolonged exposures, the relationship of body size to FEV1.0 response to a given O3 exposure dose has not been systematically examined. In the present study, 30 young adults were exposed on four occasions for 6 h (during a 6.6-h period) to constant 03 levels of zero (filtered air, FA) or 0.12 parts per million (ppm). At the latter concentration, exercise V(E) was varied in exposures to 17, 20, and 23 l min(-1) m(-2) of BSA, respectively, for each individual to achieve an equivalent ventilation rate, EVR). In the FA exposure, EVR was 23 l min(-1) m2. Percent changes in FEV1.0 for the three 0.12 ppm O3 exposures were significantly greater than that for FA, but did not differ significantly from each other. For the 6.6-h exposures, exercise EVR at or in excess of 17 l min(-1) m(-2), SS values were significantly greater than those observed for the FA protocol. Further, SS values at 6.6 h of exposure to 0.12 ppm O3 for the exercise EVR of 23 l min(-1) m(-2) protocol were significantly greater than for the 0.12 ppm O3 exercise EVR of 17 l min(-1) m(-2) protocol. To achieve a widened EVR, two 1-h exposures to 0.30 ppm O3 with continuous exercise (CE) at a level necessitating an EVR of 17 and approximately 34 l min(-1) m(-2), respectively, were completed by each subject. All postexposure pulmonary function and SS responses were significantly greater for the higher 1-h EVR protocol. In all exposures with significant O3-induced changes in FEV1.0 and SS, it was found that the smaller subjects who exercised at the lowest absolute V(E) had significantly smaller responses than did the larger subjects. These results strongly suggest that for the O3 concentrations and exposure durations used in this study, the effect of V(E) on O3-induced FEV1.0 and SS responses is not body-size-dependent.",6.2.1.1,Controlled Human Exposure,3.1.4.1.1,Controlled Human Exposure Studies

The present study was designed to determine the temporal relationships of ozone-induced inflammatory and epithelial responses and their correlation with subsequent MCM in the NTE of rats. Male F344/N rats were exposed to 0.5 ppm ozone, 8 h/day for 1, 2, or 3 days. Two h prior to sacrifice, all the rats were injected intraperitoneally with 5'-bromo-2-deoxyuridine (BrdU) to label epithelial cells undergoing DNA synthesis. Rats exposed to ozone for 1 or 2 days were killed 2 h after the exposure. Rats exposed to ozone for 3 days were killed 2 h or 1, 2, or 4 days after the exposure. Control rats were killed after a 7-day exposure to filtered air. One nasal passage from the anterior nasal cavity of each rat was fixed and processed for light microscopy to morphometrically determine the numeric densities of epithelial cells, neutrophils, and mucous cells, and the amount of intraepithelial mucosubstances in the NTE. The maxilloturbinate from the other nasal passage was processed for analysis of an airway mucin-specific gene (i.e., rMuc-5AC mRNA). Acute ozone exposure induced a rapid increase in rMuc-5AC mRNA levels prior to the onset of MCM, and the increased levels of rMuc-5AC mRNA persisted with MCM. Neutrophilic inflammation coincided with epithelial DNA synthesis and upregulation of rMuc-5AC, but was resolved when MCM first appeared in the NTE. The results of the present study suggest that upregulation of mucin mRNA by acute ozone exposure may be associated with the concurrent neutrophilic inflammation and epithelial hyperplasia in the NTE. Ozone-induced MCM may be dependent on these important pre-metaplastic responses (i.e., mucin mRNA upregulation, neutrophilic inflammation, and epithelial proliferation).",5.3.7,Airways Remodeling,0,0

We examined ozone-induced upper and lower airway inflammatory responses and the concentrations of hydroxylated salicylate metabolites using nasal lavage fluid and induced sputum, in order to identify noninvasive and sensitive biomarkers for ozone exposure and effects. A time course for plasma concentration of 2,3-dihydroxybenzoic acid (2,3-DHBA, a salicylate metabolite and an indicator for hydroxyl radical) in response to 0.12 ppm ozone was also studied. Healthy, young, nonsmoking volunteers were given acetylsalicylic acid (ASA, 975 mg) or placebo orally. Subjects were exposed to ozone (0.12 or 0.4 ppm) or filtered air in an environmental chamber for 2 h, while performing intermittent exercise. Blood was collected hourly over a 4-h period. After exposure, nasal lavage fluid was collected, and sputum was induced using hypertonic saline. Results show that in sputum the percentage of neutrophils was significantly higher after the subjects were exposed to 0.4 ppm ozone (p @lt;.05) than after they were exposed to filtered air or 0.12 ppm ozone. The absolute number and the percentage of macrophages were significantly lower at 0.4 ppm ozone than for filtered air control or 0.12 ppm ozone. The percentage of lymphocytes in sputum was also significantly lower at 0.4 ppm ozone than for filtered air control or 0.12 ppm ozone. The sputum cellular responses to ozone were not significantly altered by ASA treatment. In nasal lavage, cell counts and differentials did not change significantly after exposure to ozone in comparison to filtered air control. The cellular data indicate an acute inflammation developed during ozone exposure in the lower respiratory tract. The concentrations of total protein and interleukin-8 and the activity of N-acetyl-@bgr;-D-glucosaminidase (a lysosomal enzyme) in nasal lavage and sputum did not change significantly following exposure to ozone in comparison to filtered air control. Plasma 2,3-DHBA concentration increased significantly following exposure to 0.12 ppm ozone in an exposure-dependent temporal pattern. Salicylate metabolites in nasal lavage fluid and sputum did not increase significantly following exposure to ozone. There was a marked variation of 2,3-DHBA concentrations in airway fluids.

No effect of NO2 exposure on GPxs concentration was detected. There was an inverse correlation between baseline ELF eGPx protein concentration and the change in PMN 18 h after O3 exposure (p = 0.04).

Thirteen ( n = 13) Asth and nine ( n = 9) Nm volunteers were pretreated with indomethacin or placebo (3 days, 75 mg/day), then exposed for 2 h to 400 ppb ozone or clean air while performing mild intermittent exercise (Vimin = 30 L/min.).

Results showed similar reductions in FVC (Asth = 12%, Nm = 10%) and FEV1 (Asth = 13%, Nm = 11%) in Asth and Nm following ozone. Variables representing small-airways function demonstrated the greatest ozone-induced decline in Asth (FEF75 = 25%).

While direct comparison of pulmonary responses to 6.6-h exposures to 0.08 to 0.12 ppm ozone (O(3)) have demonstrated that chamber and face-mask inhalation methods yield closely similar results, no comparative study of responses to 2-h intermittent exercise (IE) exposures to higher O(3) concentrations have been reported. The present study was designed to achieve three primary objectives: (1) to compare pulmonary function and symptoms effects of a 2-h IE exposure to 0.30 ppm O(3) via chamber and via face mask; (2) to compare the pulmonary effects of 6.6-h chamber exposure to 0.08 ppm O(3) to those observed in 2-h IE 0.30 ppm O(3) exposures via chamber and via face mask; and (3) to examine filtered air (FA) recovery pulmonary and symptoms responses following chamber exposures of 6.6 h to 0.08 ppm O(3) and 2 h to 0.30 ppm O(3).

SHEDS-PM is a probabilistic model that estimates the population distribution of total PM exposures by randomly sampling from various input distributions. A mass balance equation is used to calculate indoor PM concentrations for the residential microenvironment from ambient outdoor PM concentrations and physical factor data (e.g., air exchange, penetration, deposition), as well as emission strengths for indoor PM sources (e.g., smoking, cooking). PM concentrations in nonresidential microenvironments are calculated using equations developed from regression analysis of available indoor and outdoor measurement data for vehicles, offices, schools, stores, and restaurants/bars. Additional model inputs include demographic data for the population being modeled and human activity pattern data from EPA's Consolidated Human Activity Database (CHAD). Model outputs include distributions of daily total PM exposures in various microenvironments (indoors, in vehicles, outdoors), and the contribution from PM of ambient origin to daily total PM exposures in these microenvironments. SHEDS-PM has been applied to the population of Philadelphia using spatially and temporally interpolated ambient PM2.5 measurements from 1992u1993 and 1990 US Census data for each census tract in Philadelphia. The resulting distributions showed substantial variability in daily total PM2.5 exposures for the population of Philadelphia (median=20 Ag/m3; 90th percentile=59 Ag/m3). Variability in human activities, and the presence of indoor-residential sources in particular, contributed to the observed variability in total PM2.5 exposures. The uncertainty in the estimated population distribution for total PM2.5 exposures was highest at the upper end of the distribution and revealed the importance of including estimates of input uncertainty in population exposure models. The distributions of daily microenvironmental PM2.5 exposures (exposures due to time spent in various microenvironments) indicated that indoor-residential PM2.5 exposures (median=13 Ag/m3) had the greatest influence on total PM2.5 exposures compared to the other microenvironments. The distribution of daily exposures to PM2.5 of ambient origin was less variable across the population than the distribution of daily total PM2.5 exposures (median=7 Ag/m3; 90th percentile=18 Ag/m3) and similar to the distribution of ambient outdoor PM2.5 concentrations. This result suggests that human activity patterns did not have as strong an influence on ambient PM2.5 exposures as was observed for exposure to other PM2.5 sources. For most of the simulated population, exposure to PM2.5 of ambient origin contributed a significant percent of the daily total PM2.5 exposures (median=37.5%), especially for the segment of the population without exposure to environmental tobacco smoke in the residence (median=46.4%). Development of the SHEDS-PM model using the Philadelphia PM2.5 case study also provided useful insights into the limitations of currently available data for use in population exposure models. In addition, data needs for improving inputs to the SHEDS-PM model, reducing uncertainty and further refinement of the model structure, were identified.",4.5.2,Residential Air Exchange Rate Modeling,0,0

Among inbred strains of mice, there is a 3-fold difference in total protein (a marker of permeability) recovered in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid after a 72-h exposure to 0.3 ppm O3. To determine the chromosomal locations of susceptibility genes, we per- formed a genome screen using recombinant inbred (RI) strains of mice derived from 03-susceptible C57BL/6J (B6) and O3-resistant C3H/HeJ (Hej) progenitors. Each RI strain was phenotyped for O3-induced hyperpermeability, and linkage was assessed for 558 markers using Map Manager QTb27. A significant quantitative trait locus (QTL) was identified on chromosome 4. The likelihood ratio x2 statistic (16.6) for the peak of the QTL was greater than the significance threshold (16.3) determined empirically by permutation test. This QTL contains a candidate gene, Toll-like receptor 4 (TIr4), that recently has been implicated in innate immunity and endotoxin susceptibility. The amount of the total trait variance explained by the QTL at TIr4, the gene with the highest likelihood ratio statistic in the QTL, was approximately 70%. To test the role of TIr4 in O3-induced hyperpermeability, BAL protein responses to O3 were compared in C3H/Heouj (OuJ) and HeJ mice that differ only at a polymorphism in the coding region of TIr4. Significantly greater protein concentrations (430 +/- 35 ""mu""g/ml) were found in Ouj mice compared with Hej mice (258 +/- 18 ""mu""g/ml) after exposure to O3. Furthermore, reverse transcriptase/polymerase chain reaction analysis demonstrated differential expression of TIr4 message levels between HeJ and Ouj mice after O3 exposure. Together, results indicate that a QTL on mouse chromosome 4 explains a significant portion of the genetic variance in O3-induced hyperpermeability, and support a role for TIr4 as a strong candidate susceptibility gene.",5.3.4,Alteration of Epithelial Barrier Function,0,0

Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BAL) was analyzed for albumin as an indicator of increased permeability, polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs) to assess the inflammatory status, macrophage inflammatory protein-2 (MIP-2, an inflammatory chemokine), and cell adhesion molecules for their role in inflammation and PMN functions. The time-related increase in albumin was matched by a similar significant increase for PMNs, MIP-2, and intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1). However, no marked change occurred for beta-2 integrin (CD-18) and leukotriene B4 (LTB4). The results establish a temporal correlation of epithelial permeability with changes in inflammatory activity and stimuli responsible for PMN recruitment in the lung. The observations of elevated MIP-2 and ICAM-1 levels are consistent with their role in injury and inflammation. An early expression of MIP-2 mRNA in BAL cells, that is, immediately post O3 exposure, and the peak increase in BAL MIP-2 levels 4 h later support the chemotactic role of MIP-2 in PMN recruitment at 4- and 12-h time points.

Blood samples were drawn before and 10, 20, 30, and 40 mm after the intratracheal instillation of HRP. The plasma levels of HRP in guinea pigs exposed for 30 mm to 3 ppm of ozone, but not to 0.5 ppm of ozone, were significantly greater than those in guinea pigs exposed to air. Although the increased plasma HRP levels after exposure to 3 ppm of ozone were unaffected by propranolol or atropine, they were completely inhibited by pretreatment with capsaicin (50 mg/kg sc, injected in two doses). These results suggest that endogenous neuropeptides mediate the ozone-induced increase in the permeability of the tracheal mucosa in guinea pigs in vivo, but neither an adrenergic nor a cholinergic pathway appears to be involved.

The effects of rabbit exposure to ozone (O3) (0.4 ppm for 4 h) on pulmonary mechanical properties and hemodynamics have been investigated on the isolated perfused lung model. Tracheal pressure, airflow, and tidal volume were measured in order to calculate lung resistance (RD and dynamic compliance (Cdyn). Using the arterial/venous/double occlusion method, the total pressure gradient (APt) was partitioned into four components (arterial, pre-, postcapillary and venous). Dose-response curves to acetylcholine (ACh), substance P (SP), and histamine were constructed in lungs isolated from rabbits immediately or 48 h after air or O3 exposure. O3 induced a significant increase in the baseline value of APt, more markedly 48 h after the exposure. Immediately after the exposure, O3 partly inhibited the ACh-, SP-, and histamine-induced decreases in Cdyn and increases in RL. This inhibitory effect was still in part present 48 h after O3 treatment. In the groups studied immediately after exposure, O3 did not significantly modify the ACh-, SP-, and histamine-induced vasoconstriction. Forty-eight hours after exposure, O3 induced a contractile response to ACh and SP in the arterial segment but decreased the response to histamine. We conclude that O3 can induce direct vascular constriction. Directly, but also 48 h after exposure, O3 can inhibit the ACh-, SP-, and histamine-induced changes in lung mechanical properties. Ozone can also induce some changes in the intensity and in the location of the vascular responses to ACh, SP, and histamine.",5.3.9,Impaired Alveolar-Arterial Oxygen Transfer ,0,0

These exposures employed quasi-continuous ventilation rates (VE) of about 40 liters per minute (l/mm). However, typical ambient exposures include changing breathing rates and changing O(3) levels that vary both diurnally and as a function of indoor-outdoor behavioral patterns. The latter can be accomplished more readily by a face mask exposure system than in a chamber exposure system. In the present study, 12 young adult subjects were exposed on seven occasions for 6 h (during a 6.6-h period) to both constant and variable O(3) and breathing rate dosing regimens utilizing a newly devised face mask exposure system. Four protocols entailed constant exercise VE (about 40 l/mm) with either constant O(3) levels at zero or 0.12 ppm, or with acute and obtuse triangular O(3) profiles (averaging about 0.12 ppm over 6 h) typical of Los Angeles and New Jersey summer daylight ambient O(3) patterns, respectively. In addition, pulmonary function and symptoms were also measured hourly for three realistic dosing regimens with variable VE and O(3) levels simulating maximally exposed individuals in recent summer camp and outdoor worker studies where activities and breathing rates were continuously monitored. No significant difference in pulmonary function or subjective symptoms responses were observed between the three constant exercise VE protocols in which mean O(3) concentration was 0.12 ppm but the profile varied from constant to acute and obtuse triangular applications. A protocol which employed a constant level 0.12 ppm O(3) exposure but variable work intensity simulating that of an outdoor construction laborer which resulted in a 9% greater mean VE, tended to result in higher pulmonary function impairment than the three constant exercise VE protocols with mean 0.12 ppm O(3) concentration exposure. Subjective symptom responses were similar for these four protocols. Pulmonary function and subjective symptoms responses for these protocols were all significantly different from those observed for the FA exposure. The two exposures simulating VE patterns observed in a child at summer camp and a postal carrier onfoot did not produce pulmonary function or subjective symptoms responses that were significantly different from those for the FA exposure. This was attributed to low mean VE, which was about half that observed for the other four O(3) exposures. It was concluded that less abrupt triangular O(3) exposure applications than that used in an EPA study do not always produce significantly greater pulmonary function responses than those observed in square-wave O(3) exposures at the same mean concentration.",6.2.1.1,Controlled Human Exposure,3.1.4.1.1,Controlled Human Exposure Studies

Pretreatment of O3-susceptible C57BL/6J mice with a specific inhibitor of total NOS (N(G)-monomethyl-L-arginine) significantly decreased the mean lavageable protein concentration (a marker of lung permeability) induced by O3 (0.3 parts/million for 72 h) compared with vehicle control mice. Furthermore, lavageable protein in C57BL/B6 mice with targeted disruption of Nos2 [Nos2(-/-)] was 50% less than the protein in wild-type [Nos2(+/+)] mice after O3. To determine whether Tlr4 modulates Nos2 mRNA levels, we studied C3H/HeJ (HeJ) and C3H/HeOuJ mice that differ only at a missense mutation in Tlr4 that confers resistance to O3-induced lung hyperpermeability in the HeJ strain. Nos2 and Tlr4 mRNA levels were significantly reduced and correlated in resistant HeJ mice after O3 relative to those in susceptible C3H/HeOuJ mice.

Exposure of humans to ambient levels of ozone (O(3)) causes inflammatory changes within lung tissues. These changes have been reported for the ""initial"" (1- to 3-h) and ""late"" (18- to 20-h) postexposure periods. We hypothesized that at the late period, when protein and cellular markers of inflammation at the airway surface remain abnormal and the integrity of the epithelial barrier is compromised, bronchial reactivity would be increased. To test this, we measured airway responsiveness to cumulative doses of methacholine (MCh) aerosol in healthy subjects 19+/-1 h after a single exposure to O(3) (130 min at ambient levels between 120 and 240 parts/billion and alternate periods of rest and moderate exercise) or filtered air. Exposures were conducted at two temperatures: mild (22 degrees C) and moderate (30 degrees C). At the late period, bronchial reactivity to MCh increased, i.e., interpolated dose of MCh leading to a 50% fall in specific airway conductance (PC(50)) was less after O(3) than after filtered air. PC(50) for O(3) at 22 degrees C was 27 mg/ml (20% less than the PC(50) after filtered air), and for O(3) at 30 degrees C it was 19 mg/ml (70% less than the PC(50) after filtered air). The forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV(1)) at the late time point after O(3) was slightly but significantly reduced (2.3%) from the preexposure level. There was no relationship found between the functional changes observed early after exposure to O(3) and subsequent changes in bronchial reactivity or FEV(1) at the late time point. These results suggest that bronchial reactivity is significantly altered approximately 1 day after O(3); this injury may contribute to the respiratory morbidity that is observed 1-2 days after an episode of ambient air pollution.",5.3.5,Sensitization of Bronchial Smooth Muscle,3.1.4.1.1,Controlled Human Exposure Studies

These responses are often characterized by primary decreases in important indices of cardiac and thermoregulatory function, along with secondary decreases in associated parameters. For example, when rats are exposed to typical experimental concentrations of ozone, they demonstrate robust and consistent decreases in heart rate (HR) ranging from 50-100 bpm, while core body temperature (Tco) often falls 1.5-2.5 degrees C. Other related indices, such as metabolism, minute ventilation, blood pressure, and cardiac output, appear to exhibit similar deficits. The magnitudes of the observed decreases may be modulated by changes in experimental conditions and appear to vary inversely with both ambient temperature and body mass. More recent studies in which both healthy and compromised rats were exposed to either particulate matter or its specific components yielded similar results. The agents studied included representative examples of ambient, combustion, and natural source particles, along with individual or combined exposures to their primary metallic constituents. In addition to the substantial decreases in HR and Tco, similar to those seen with the ozone-exposed rats, these animals also displayed numerous adverse changes in electrocardiographic waveforms and cardiac rhythm, frequently resulting in fatal outcomes. While there is only limited experimental evidence that addresses the underlying mechanism/s of these responses, there is some indication that they may be related to stimulation of pulmonary irritant receptors and that they may be at least partially mediated via the parasympathetic nervous system.",5.3.2,Activation of Neural Reflexes,0,0

Differences of a factor of 2 or greater in plume ozone formation rates and yields as a function of NOx and volatile organic compound concentrations were consistently observed.

The modern global coverage of aircraft flights offers an opportunity to provide such a characterization, and examine the ubiquity of such structures, in space and time. Research aircraft measuring vertical profiles of atmospheric chemical constituents frequently discern quasi-horizontal atmospheric layers with mean thicknesses of the order of 1 km and mean altitudes between 5 and 7 km (refs 10,11,12). These layers can be characterized and categorized by various combinations of ozone, water vapour, carbon monoxide and methane deviations from background profiles. Five commercial aircraft have been recently equipped to measure water vapour and ozone concentrations, and automatically collect vertical profile information on landing and take-off (refs 13,14,15). Here we synthesize measurements from both research and commercial flights and demonstrate the ubiquity in space and time of four layer types (as categorized by their chemical signatures). Up to one-fifth of the lowest 12 km of the atmosphere is occupied by such layers. We suggest that this universality reflects basic characteristics of the atmosphere hitherto unexplored, with potential implications for present understanding of a wide variety of dynamic and chemical atmospheric processes.

By employing published data for airway anatomy, gas-phase dispersion coefficients, and gas-phase mass transfer coefficients while neglecting diffusion limitations in the mucus phase, the single-path model was capable of predicting the uptake distribution for O3 but not the steeper distribution that was observed for Cl2. To simultaneously explain the data for these two gases, it was necessary to increase gas-phase mass transfer coefficients and to include a finite diffusion resistance of O3 within the mucous layer. The O3 reaction rate constants that accounted for this diffusion resistance, 2 I 106 s-1 in the mouth and 8 I 106 s-1 in the nose and lower airways, were much greater than previously reported reactivities of individual substrates found in mucus.",5.2.2.6,Interindividual Variability in Dose,0,0

The airmass transport patterns were estimated from source impact regions derived from forward airmass histories. Daily maximum ozone concentrations were used to define locally and regionally high- (90th percentile) and low- (10th percentile) ozone days. Examination of transport during locally high-ozone days revealed that there is poor transport in the central part of the domain, i.e. from Tennessee to northern Indiana, and in the South from Texas to South Carolina due to stagnating or recirculating air masses. However, high ozone concentrations over the western and northern sections of the domain occurred during strong and persistent southerly and westerly winds, respectively. In addition, on average, high ozone concentration surrounding the central part of the domain were associated with transport from this region. These results support the notion that ozone exceedances in the central and Southeastern US are predominately ""homegrown"" while the western and northern section of the domain are also influenced by regional transport. In contrast, on low-ozone days, the transport was predominantly from outside (e.g., Canada and the Gulf of Mexico) into the Eastern US.

However, because of its high reactivity, ozone cannot penetrate far into the airl lung tissue interface. It has been proposed that ozone reacts with unsaturated fatty acids (UFA) in the epithelial lining fluid (ELF) and cell membranes to generate a cascade of lipid ozonation products (LOP) that mediate ozone-induced toxicity. To test this hypothesis, we exposed cultured human bronchial epithelial cells (BEAS-2B) to LOP (1-100 ""mu""M) produced from the ozonation of 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-Phosphatidylcholine (POPC) and measured the activity of PLA2, PLC, and PLD. The PLA2 isoform responsible for arachidonic acid release (AA) in stimulated cultures was also characterized. Activation of PLA2, PLC, and PLD by three oxidants, hydrogen peroxide (H202), tert-butyl hydroperoxide (t-BOOH) and 2,2'-azobis(2-amidinopropane)dihydrochloride (AAPH) also was measured and compared to that of LOP. The derivatives of ozonized POPC at the sn-2 residue, 9-oxononanoyl (PC-ALD), 9-hydroxy-9-hydroperoxynonanoyl (PC-HHP), and 8-(-5-octyl-1,2,4-trioxolan-3yl-) octanoyl (POPC-OZ) selectively activated PLA2 in a dose-dependent fashion. Cytosolic PLA2 (cPLA2) measured in the cytosolic fraction of stimulated cell lysates was found to be the predominant isoform responsible for AA release. PLC activation was exclusively induced by the hydroxyhydroperoxide derivatives. PC-HHP and the 9-carbon hydroxyhydroperoxide (HHP-C9) increased PLC activity. PLD activity also was induced by LOP generated from POPC. Incubation of cultures with H202 alone did not stimulate PLC; however, in the presence of the aldehyde, nonanal, a 62 +/-2% increase in PLC activity was found, suggesting that the increase in activity was due to the formation of the intermediate HHP-C9. t-BOOH, and AAPH also failed to induce PLA2 activation, but did activate PLC, under conditions of exposure identical to that of LOP. Only t-BOOH activated PLD. These results suggest that biologically relevant concentrations of LOP activate PLA2,PLC, and PLD in the airway epithehial cell, a primary target to ozone exposure.

Low outdoor concentrations resulted in uniformly low indoor concentrations, but high outdoor levels resulted in a range of indoor levels.

Using information collected from interviews performed before and after sampling, we explored relationships between measured indoor O3, home operating characteristics, and ambient O3 reported at the closest regional monitoring station. Indoor O3 levels were largely determined by outdoor O3 levels and the duration of time that windows were kept open. Ozone measured adjacent to study homes predicted indoor levels no better than station ambient values.

During O3 exposure (1 pm, 3 h), minute ventilation ( E) decreased by 64 ? 4% in wild-type, but only 24 ? 5% in p55/p75 TNFR / mice, indicating that despite their reduced O3-induced AHR, the TNFR-deficient mice actually inhaled a greater dose of O3.

Strong correlations among numerous ambient pollutant concentrations, however, have made it difficult to determine the relative contribution of each pollutant to a given health outcome and have led to criticism that health effect estimates for particulate matter may be biased due to confounding. In the current study we used data collected from a multipollutant exposure study conducted in Baltimore, Maryland, during both the summer and winter to address the potential for confounding further. Twenty-four-hour personal exposures and corresponding ambient concentrations to fine particulate matter (PM2.5), ozone, nitrogen dioxide, sulfur dioxide, and carbon monoxide were measured for 56 subjects. Results from correlation and regression analyses showed that personal PM2.5 and gaseous air pollutant exposures were generally not correlated, as only 9 of the 178 individual-specific pairwise correlations were significant. Similarly, ambient concentrations were not associated with their corresponding personal exposures for any of the pollutants, except for PM2.5, which had significant associations during both seasons (p < 0.0001). Ambient gaseous concentrations were, however, strongly associated with personal PM2.5 exposures. The strongest associations were shown between ambient O3 and personal PM2.5 (p < 0.0001 during both seasons). These results indicate that ambient PM2.5 concentrations are suitable surrogates for personal PM2.5 exposures and that ambient gaseous concentrations are surrogates, as opposed to confounders, of PM2.5. These findings suggest that the use of multiple pollutant models in epidemiologic studies of PM2.5 may not be suitable and that health effects attributed to the ambient gases may actually be a result of exposures to PM2.5.",4.3.3,Personal-Ambient Concentration Relationships,0,0

Epidemiology studies show an association between ambient oxidant levels and increased asthma attacks and hospital admissions. Objective: The purpose of our study was to evaluate the response of persons with mild asthma to inhaled allergen after ozone exposure conditions similar to those observed in urban areas of the United States. Methods: Using a double-blind, counter-balanced design, we exposed 9 (5 women and 4 men) subjects with mild atopic asthma (house dust mite sensitive) to clean air and to 0.16 ppm ozone for 7.6 hours; exposures were separated by a minimum of 4 weeks. During exposure, subjects performed light exercise (ventilation =24 L/min) for 50 minutes of each hour, and pul-monary function was evaluated before and after exposures. The morning after exposure, subjects underwent bronchial challenge with inhaled house dust mite allergen (Der-matophagoides farinae). Using a series of doubling allergen concentrations, subjects inhaled 5 breaths of nebulized allergen (0.06 to 500 AU/mL) at 10-minute intervals until a minimum of a 20% decrement in FEV1 was elicited. Results: Compared with the change in FEV1 during air exposure, there was a mean 9.1% ? 2.5% (SEM) decrement in FEV1 observed because of ozone (P < .01). Seven of the 9 subjects required less allergen after ozone exposure than after air exposure; there was a 0.58 mean dose shift in the doubling concentration of allergen attributable to the ozone exposure (P= .03). Conclusion: These findings indicate that exposure of subjects with mild atopic asthma to ozone at levels sufficient to cause modest decrements in lung function also increases the reactivity to allergen.

Different measures were used to quantify the degree of uniformity of PM2.5 concentrations in the urban areas characterized. It was observed that PM2.5 concentrations varied to differing degrees in the urban areas examined. Analyses of several urban areas in the Southeast indicated high correlations between site pairs and spatial uniformity in concentration fields. Considerable spatial variation was found in other regions, especially in the West. Even within urban areas in which all site pairs were highly correlated, a variable degree of heterogeneity in PM2.5 concentrations was found. Thus, even though concentrations at pairs of sites were highly correlated, their concentrations were not necessarily the same. These findings indicate that the potential for exposure misclassification errors in time-series epidemiologic studies exists. 
Implications: Epidemiologic time-series studies typically use daily 24-hr particulate matter concentrations averaged across several monitors in a city or data obtained at a central monitoring site to relate to health outcomes. If 24-hr average concentrations differ significantly across an urban area, exposure misclassification could be an important consideration when an average of ambient monitors is used as a surrogate for personal exposure.

In this study we examined the impact of an environmentally relevant ozone challenge on the antioxidant defenses present at the surface of the lung in two groups known to have profound differences in their antioxidant defense network: healthy control (HG) and mild asthmatic (MA) subjects. We hypothesized that baseline differences in antioxidant concentrations within the respiratory tract lining fluid (RTLF), as well as induced responses, would predict the magnitude of individual responsiveness. We observed a significant loss of ascorbate (ASC) from proximal (-45.1%, p < .01) and distal RTLFs (-11.7%, p < .05) in healthy subjects 6 h after the end of the ozone challenge. This was associated (Rs, -0.7 l,p < .01) with increased glutathione disulphide (GSSG) in these compartments (p = .01 and p < .05). Corresponding responses were not seen in asthmatics, where basal ASC concentrations were significantly lower (p < .01) and associated with elevated concentrations of GSSG (p < .05).

Twenty-four h after the last IN challenge rats were sacrificed; nasal tissues were removed and processed for light microscopic examination and morphometric analysis of numeric densities of inflammatory and epithelial cell populations and volume densities of intraepithelial mucosubstances. A single OVA challenge caused a significant influx of neutrophils and eosinophils into the submucosa of all nasal tissues. Ozone exposure further enhanced the appearance of eosinophils in the maxilloturbinates of OVA-challenged rats but did not increase inflammation in other nasal tissues. After 3 days of ozone/OVA coexposures, the nasal transitional epithelium lining the maxilloturbinates had increased numbers of epithelial cells as well as the appearance of mucus-containing cells in areas normally absent of these secretory cells (i.e., MCM). Multiple challenges with OVA caused increased epithelial mucosubstances in the respiratory epithelium lining the septum without increasing the number of epithelial cells. Multiple exposures to both ozone and OVA caused greater increases in intraepithelial mucosubstances in the septum than those elicited by OVA alone.

This change of behavior occurs at [NO2] ~ 0.23 ppb in our model. Also, the response of the atmosphere to increased CO fluxes undergoes a qualitative change as a function of [NOx]. At low levels of [NOx], an increase in CO fluxes into the atmosphere depletes [OH] and increases [CH4] and [H2], as reported in the literature.

Deposition velocities of H2 and CO were virtually independent of the soil temperature measured in 3? to 10?mm depths and agreed with those measured in the temperate regions. The deposition velocities were inhibited or stimulated by irrigation water depending on the conditions of the individual field sites. H2 production by soil was not observed.

Production rates increased exponentially with soil temperatures, giving activation energies of 57?110 kJ mol?1 and increased linearly with soil organic carbon content. CO production rates followed a diel rhythm parallel to soil surface temperatures. Production generally exceeded CO deposition during the hot hours of the day, so that arid subtropical soils act as a net source of atmospheric CO during this time.

Fifteen healthy volunteers were exposed in random fashion to 0.2 ppm ozone for 4 h on a single day and to 0.2 ppm O3 for 4 h on 4 consecutive days while exercising moderately for 30 min of each hour. Pulmonary function tests were obtained immediately before and after each 4-h exposure. Bronchoscopy was performed 20 h after the completion of each exposure arm to obtain bronchoalveolar lavage(BAL) for measurement of markers of inflammation. Our results show initial progression followed by attenuation of the acute physiologic response to O3 with repeated daily exposures. We found a significant difference in percent change in FEV1 , FVC, and specific airway resistance (SRaw) across the single-day exposure when compared with the change across Day 4 of the 4-d exposure. Bronchial fraction (the first 15 ml of BAL return) and BAL were analyzed for the following end points: total and differential cell counts, total protein, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), fibronectin, interleukin-6 (IL-6), interleukin-8 (IL-8), and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF). In the bronchial fraction the number of polymorphonuclear cells (PMN)s and fibronectin concentration were significantly decreased after 4-d exposure compared with single-day exposure. In BAL, significant decreases in the number of PMNs, fibronectin, and IL-6 were found after 4-d exposure versus single-day exposure. These results suggest that there is attenuation of the O3-induced inflammatory response in both proximal airways and distal lung with repeated daily exposures.",5.4.2.5,Attenuation of Responses,0,0

Relative to FA exposure, O3 exposure induced no statistically significant changes in cardiac index, ventricular performance, pulmonary artery pressure, pulmonary and systemic vascular resistances, ECG, serum cardiac enzymes, plasma catecholamines and atrial natriuretic factor, and SaO2. The overall results did not indicate major acute cardiovascular effects of O3 in either the hypertensive or the control subjects. However, mean preexposure to postexposure changes were significantly (p < 0.02) larger with O3 than with FA for rate-pressure product (1,353 beats/min/mm Hg) and for heart rate (8 beats/min); these responses were not significantly different between the hypertensive and the control subjects. Significant O3 effects were also observed for mean FEV1 (-6%), and AaPO2 (> 10 mm Hg increase), which were not significantly different between the two groups.

J. Hazucha, D. V. Bates, and P. A. Bromberg. J. Appl. Physiol. 67: 1535u1541, 1989). If this were so, pain suppression or inhibition by opioid-receptor agonists should partially or fully reverse O3-induced symptomatic and lung functional responses. The objectives of this study were to determine whether O3-induced pain limits maximal inspiration and whether endogenous opioids contribute to modulation of the effects of inhaled O3 on lung function. The participants in this double-blind crossover study were healthy volunteers (18u59 yr) known to be ??weak' (WR; n =20) and ??strong' O3 responders (SR; n =42). They underwent either two 2-h exposures to air or two 2-h exposures to 0.42 parts/million O3 with moderate intermittent exercise. Immediately after post-O3 spirometry, the WR were randomly given either naloxone (0.15 mg/kg iv) or saline, whereas SR randomly received either sufentanil (0.2 microgram/kg iv) or saline. O3 exposure significantly (P < 0.001) impaired lung function. In SR, sufentanil rapidly, although not completely, reversed both the chest pain and spirometric effects (forced expiratory volume in 1 s; P< 0.0001) compared with saline. Immediate postexposure administration of saline or naloxone had no significant effect on WR. Plasma b-endorphin levels were not related to an individual's O3 responsiveness. Cutaneous pain variables showed a nonsignificant weak association with O3 responsiveness. These observations demonstrate that nociceptive mechanisms play a key role in modulating O3-induced inhibition of inspiration but not in causing lack of spirometric response to O3 exposure in WR.",5.3.2,Activation of Neural Reflexes,0,0

The asthmatics showed allergic airways inflammation at baseline but ozone did not aggravate this at the investigated time point.

Pulmonary function was monitored during the allergen challenge and after the exposure to O3 or air. Six hours later, induced sputum was collected. After 4 weeks, the experiment was repeated with the same subjects. Allergen induced a comparable late airway response in both challenges. O3 exposure induced a significant decrease in FVC, FEV1, and vital capacity, and was associated with a significant increase in total symptom score compared with air exposure. The percentage of eosinophils, but not the percentage of neutrophils, in induced sputum was significantly higher after exposure to O3 than after exposure to air (p = 0.04). These results indicate that O3 exposure after a late airway response elicited by allergen challenge can potentiate the eosinophilic inflammatory response induced by the allergen challenge itself in subjects with mild atopic asthma.

It is yet unknown whether inflammatory and biochemical effects in lower airways of humans, as observed upon single O3 exposure, also show a diminutive response following repeated exposure to O3. The aim of this study was to investigate inflammatory, permeability, and histopathological responses in lungs of rats following repeated daily O3 exposure and to study the time course of attenuation and recovery of these effects using single O3 challenges at various postexposure times. To aid in animal-to-human extrapolation, this study and a previously reported human study (Devlin et al., 1997) were designed with similar protocols. Wistar rats were exposed for 5 consecutive days to 0.4 ppm O3 for 12 h/night. Subsequently, the time course of postexposure recovery was determined by a single challenge of 12 h to 0.4 ppm O3 after a 5-, 10-, 15-, or 20-day recovery period. Broncho-alveolar lavage (BAL) examination and histopathology were performed 12 h after this O3 challenge. To quantify the magnitude of the O3 response, results were compared with a group exposed only once for 12 h to 0.4 ppm O3 and sacrificed simultaneously. The results demonstrate that a single exposure of 0.4 ppm O3 causes marked permeability and inflammatory responses in lower airways of rats, as evidenced by enhanced BAL fluid levels of proteins, fibronectin, interleukin (IL)-6, and inflammatory cells. However, 5 days of exposure to 0.4 ppm O3 for 12 h/night resulted in a complete disappearance of these responses, resulting in BAL fluid values that were not different from those observed in unexposed controls. Postexposure analyses of pulmonary response to O3 challenges demonstrated that these attenuated responses show a gradual recovery. The data indicate that with respect to BAL fluid levels of albumin, IL-6, and number of macrophages and neutrophils, the period for lung tissue to regain its full susceptibility and responsiveness to O3 following a 5-day preexposure period is approximately 15-20 days. Remarkably, the total protein and fibronectin responses in BAL fluid still exhibited an attenuated response to an O3 challenge at 20 days postexposure. Morphometry (number of BrdU-labeled cells in terminal bronchiolar epithelium, and number of alveolar macrophages) showed that after a recovery of 5-10 days following a 5-day preexposure the response to a challenge was identical to that after a single exposure.

Atmospheric states can be diagnosed from observations or simulated by dynamical models (with or without four-dimensional data assimilation, FDDA). In general, diagnostic models are straightforward to operate, but obtaining sufficient observations to analyze regional-scale features is costly, may omit key variables and often lack sufficient spatial or temporal density to describe the fields adequately. Dynamical models, although still imperfect, have improved in recent years and are now widely accepted for many air-quality modeling applications. Examination of the current state of dynamical models used as meteorological pre-processors indicates that useful simulations for real cases are feasible for scales at least as fine as 1 km. Introduction of faster computers and practical FDDA techniques already allow simulations of regional episodes lasting up to 5-10 d with fine resolutions (5 km or less). As technology has improved, however, a need has developed for better parameterizations to represent vital physical processes, such as boundary layer fluxes, deep convection and clouds, at these finer grid scales.

In the past 30 years, these models have evolved from rather crude representations of the physics and chemistry impacting trace species to their current state: comprehensive, but not complete. The evolution has included advancements in not only the level of process descriptions, but also the computational implementation, including numerical methods. As part of the NARSTO Critical Reviews, this article discusses the current strengths and weaknesses of air quality models and the modeling process. Current Eulerian models are found to represent well the primary processes impacting the evolution of trace species in most cases though some exceptions may exist. For example, sub-grid-scale processes, such as concentrated power plant plumes, are treated only approximately. It is not apparent how much such approximations affect their results and the polices based upon those results. A significant weakness has been in how investigators have addressed, and communicated, such uncertainties. Studies find that major uncertainties are due to model inputs, e.g., emissions and meteorology, more so than the model itself. One of the primary weakness identified is in the modeling process, not the models. Evaluation has been limited both due to data constraints. Seldom is there ample observational data to conduct a detailed model intercomparison using consistent data (e.g., the same emissions and meteorology). Further model advancement, and development of greater confidence in the use of models, is hampered by the lack of thorough evaluation and intercomparisons. Model advances are seen in the use of new tools for extending the interpretation of model results, e.g., process and sensitivity analysis, modeling systems to facilitate their use, and extension of model capabilities, e.g., aerosol dynamics capabilities and sub-grid-scale representations. Another possible direction that is the development and widespread use of a community model acting as a platform for multiple groups and agencies to collaborate and progress more rapidly.

Isovolumetric FEF25-75, Vmax50, and Vmax75 were reduced about equally at 25 min after O3 exposure (p &lt; or = 0.02) and showed no recovery at 24 h. FVC and FEV1, although still depressed after 24 h (p &lt; 0.05), showed substantial recovery (p &lt; 0.01). FRC, RV, and VisoV showed no effect of O3 exposure. No gender differences in O3 responsiveness were found. In summary, O3-induced reductions in isovolumetric flow rates, suggestive of small-airway dysfunction, may persist for 24 h following acute exposure to O3, a time-course consistent with inflammation.",5.3.2,Activation of Neural Reflexes,0,0

Pulmonary function and symptom responses,"Folinsbee, LJ; Devlin, RB; Robbins, MK; Biscardi, FH; Abdul-Salaam, S; Koren, HS",1995,"We exposed 15 healthy young adult males to 0.40 ppm ozone for 2h/day on five consecutive days and again 10 or 20 days after these initial exposures. Subjects exercised at a level sufficient to produce a ventilation of appoximately 64 L/ min for 15 min of each 30 min. We measured spirometry, airway resistance, and symptoms before, during, and after each exposure. FVC, FEV(1), and several other spirometric indices showed marked reductions on the first exposure day, increased responses on the second and third day, and lesser responses on subsequent days. Compared to each day's pre-exposure value, FEV(1) decrements (deltaFEV(1)) averaged -18, -30, -21, -7, and -4 percent over the 5 days. Overall decline in FEV(1) compared to air exposures were even larger since the baseline pre-exposure FEV(1) and FVC were reduced on the 2nd-5th days of exposure. Under these exposure conditions, recovery from ozone exposure was incomplete in 24 hours in the most responsive subjects, as indicated by a reduction in baseline FVC and FEV(1) values and, in some cases, the persistence of symptoms. By the fifth exposure day, baseline FVC had returned to pre-participation levels for most subjects, symptoms were absent, and the spirometric response to ozone was minimal. The 5-day average deltaFEV(1) was correlated with each subject's average decline (days 2-5) in baseline FVC (R(2) = 0.64). For exposures conducted 10 or 20 days later, baseline function was at pre-participation levels and FEV(1) responses were similar to the first exposure. FEF(75%), a presumed indicator of small airways function, showed a similar pattern of response as FEV(1) and FVC, but the largest response occurred after the third day and on the fifth day was reduced by less than half that after the first exposure (-17% vs -11%). The exercise breathing pattern showed persistent rapid shallow breathing despite the absence of spirometric responses after 5 exposures. During ozone exposures, the breathing frequency (f(B)) averaged 41, 45, 49, 43, and 42 bpm compared to 33 bpm during air exposures. Elevated f(B) persisted during exposures conducted 10 (43) or 20 days (43) later. Persistence of this breathing pattern even after 10 or 20 days, suggests that this response may be learned and associated with reducing breathing discomfort and coughing during ozone. Respiratory symptoms were correlated with spirometry within individual subjects (R(2) from 0.56 to 0.80) but there was no significant correlation across subjects within a given exposure situation. With a few exceptions, breathing pattern variables, symptoms, and spirometry were not significantly correlated with each other. We conclude that repeated exposure to high ozone dose leads to a fall in spirometry that persists for at least 24 h with attenuation of some responses (spirometry, symptoms) and partial or no attenuation of others (breathing pattern, FEF(75%)).",6.2.1.1,Controlled Human Exposure,0,0

Ozone concentrations were similar in both areas, ranging from 40 to 157 micrograms/m3 (1/2h means) during the exercise tests. The two communities differed with respect to long-term average pollution levels. The mean <B>NO2</B> concentration over the six months study period was 70 micrograms/m3 in Chiasso and 18 micrograms/m3 in rural Aurigeno. Of the eligible children 85% participated and attended 4-6 tests. Parents completed a standardized questionnaire on family background, home characteristics and the child's early and present illness history. A total of 500 acceptable pairs of spirograms and corresponding ozone concentrations (average 3.8 per child) were available for analysis. Regressions of each individual's pre-post differences of FVC, FEV1 and peak flow on ozone concentrations measured during the outdoor exercise indicated that elevated ozone levels significantly reduced peak flow values. Adjustments for temperature and relative humidity increased the magnitude of the peak flow slopes. The average adjusted regression coefficient for delta-peak flow on ozone was -2.28 mL/s/micrograms/m3 (95% CI, -0.57 -3.99).

To assess conditions under which ROG or NO(x) controls would be most effective, we have analyzed predictions from four studies that represent different locations and meteorological conditions, distinct chemical inputs, e.g., with or without significant biogenic emissions, and different air quality models. A consistent association is found between the sensitivity of ozone to reductions in ROG versus NO(x) emissions and the simulated total reactive nitrogen (NO(y)) at the time and place of peak ozone. In the studies examined, ozone was predicted to be reduced most effectively by ROG controls at locations where NO(y) concentrations exceeded a threshold value falling in the range of 10 to 25 ppb, whereas NO(x) controls were predicted to be more effective where NO(y) concentrations were below that threshold. The NO(y) level explains much of the difference in ozone sensitivity at different locations and provides a basis for comparison of predicted sensitivity from different models. In contrast, the morning concentration ratio of ROG to NO(x) that has been used in the past is a less reliable indicator Of 03 sensitivity.

Bronchial C-fibers (BrCs) were the lung afferents most susceptible to ozone, the activity of 10 of 11 BrCs increasing from 0.2 +/- 0.2 to 4.6 +/- 1.3 impulses/s within 1-7 min of ozone exposure. Ten of 15 rapidly adapting receptors (RARs) were stimulated by ozone, their activity increasing from 1.5 +/- 0.4 to 4.7 +/- 0.7 impulses/s. Stimulation of RARs (but not of BrCs) appeared secondary to the ozone-induced reduction of lung compliance because it was abolished by hyperinflation of the lungs. Ozone had little effect on pulmonary C-fibers or slowly adapting pulmonary stretch receptors. Our results suggest that both BrCs and RARs contribute to the tachypnea and bronchoconstriction evoked by acute exposure to ozone when vagal conduction is intact and that BrCs alone are responsible for the vagally mediated tachypnea that survives vagal cooling to 7 degrees C.",5.3.2,Activation of Neural Reflexes,0,0

Exposures to purified air alone served as controls. Responses of subjects were similar to those observed previously: Canadians on the average showed greater clinical and physiological reactivity to exposure than did Californians, who were no more than minimally reactive.

A strong association was observed between the O3 and NO x oxidation product (NO z = NO y ? NO x ) levels. The higher O3 levels were associated with air masses impacted by higher NO x emissions that had been photochemically processed. An analysis of the data indicates that the ultimate O3 production is about 10 molecules of O3 produced for each molecule of NOx emitted. The analysis results also suggest that O3 net production continues until about 70% of the NO x has been converted into NO z . The PAN/HNO3 ratios observed suggest that the air masses in Giles County are composed of higher volatile organic carbon/NO x ratios than the air masses observed at other rural sites in eastern North America.

(2) Does the subject develop resistance or adaptatin to the respiratory effects of ozone? The subjects were exposed for 2 h in an environmental chamber at 35 degrees C and 45% relative humidity to filtered air on day 1, to ozone on days 2 through 4, and to filtered air on day 5.

Three O3 effect measurements (increased BAL protein and neutrophils and decreased BAL macrophages) were also made in subjects or animals exposed in parallel to determine whether there was a correspondence between dose and effect measurements.

BAL cells and centrifugally separable surfactant material were freeze-dried and analyzed by mass spectrometer for excess 18O. Results showed that the exercising humans had four- to fivefold higher 18O concentrations in all of their BAL constituents than did the rats. The humans also had significant increases in all of the effects markers after 0.4 ppm O3, whereas the rats did not. Rats that were exposed to higher concentrations of 18O3 (2.0 ppm) had levels of 18O in BAL that were more comparable to but still lower than those of exercising humans. Changes in all of the effects markers in these rats were comparable or higher than in exercising humans. Therefore, it appears that O3 toxicity in resting rats underestimates effects in exercising humans because rats have a lower than expected dose of O3 to the distal lung.

At 37 degrees C, addition of ozone to the inspired air decreased tidal volume and dynamic lung compliance and increased breathing frequency, total lung resistance, and tracheal smooth muscle tension. Ozone still evoked significant effects when conduction in myelinated vagal axons was blocked selectively by cooling the nerves to 7 degrees C. Ozone-induced effects were largely abolished when nonmyelinated vagal axons were blocked by cooling to 0 degree C, breathing during ozone inhalation at 0 degree C being generally similar to that during air breathing at 0 degree C, except that minute volume and inspiratory flow were higher.

Finally, sodium salicylate (150 mg/kg on Day 10) was shown to be synergistic with ozone (1 ppm in midgestation), in that the combined treatment decreased fetal weight, and to a lesser extent increased the resorption rate.

The first 2 h of exposure included alternating 15-min periods of rest and exercise on a motorized treadmill producing a minute ventilation (VE) of 25 L/min/m2 body surface area (BSA). After exposure, subjects completed a set of pulmonary function tests and a symptom questionnaire. Lung function and symptom responses were expressed as percent change from baseline and analyzed using a nonparametric two factor analysis of variance. Three primary variables were analyzed: FEV1, specific airway resistance (SRaw), and cough. Statistical analysis demonstrated no significant differences in response to O3 among the individual gender-race groups. For the group as a whole, changes in the variables FEV1, SRaw, and cough were first noted at 0.12, 0.18, and 0.18 ppm O3, respectively.

Exposure of animals to 510, 1000, or 1960 ?g/m3 (0.26, 0.51, or 1.0 ppm) of O3 for 72 hr resulted in significantly elevated levels of lavage fluid protein when compared to that of air controls. This effect was not observed in animals exposed to 196 ?g O3/m3 (0.10 ppm). When exposure time was reduced to 3 hr, the O3-induced protein accumulation in lavage fluids was undetectable unless the time of lavage was delayed 10?15 hr following the exposure. Under these conditions, elevated protein content was seen in lung lavage fluids obtained from animals exposed to O3 ranging from 510 to 1470 ?g O3/m3 (0.26-0.75 ppm) and a dose relationship between the amount of protein accumulation in the lung and the concentration of O3 to which the animals were exposed was observed. Vitamin C deficiency did not enhance this O3-induced lesion in guinea pigs. The dose relationship has also been confirmed by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of the lavage fluids.

The rate of appearance of the [3H]histamine in the plasma during inhalation challenge was used to estimate airway permeability. To perturb the airways, conscious sheep were exposed to either 0.5 or 1.0 ppm O3 for 2 hr via an endotracheal tube. Airway responsiveness and airway permeability were measured prior to and 1 day after exposure. In six sheep exposed to 0.5 ppm O3, increased airway responsiveness and airway permeability were observed 1 day after exposure. Four of seven sheep exposed to 1.0 ppm O3 had enhanced airway responsiveness and airway permeability, while the remaining three sheep showed corresponding decreases in airway responsiveness and airway permeability. Since the O3-induced directional changes in airway responsiveness paralleled the directional changes in airway permeability in both the positive and negative directions, it was concluded that changes in airway responsiveness to inhaled histamine following exposure to O3 may be related to concomitant changes in airway permeability to this agent.",5.3.4,Alteration of Epithelial Barrier Function,0,0

Bronchial reactivity was assessed by measuring the rise in specific airway resistance (delta SRaw) produced by inhalation of 10 breaths of histamine aerosol (1.6% solution). In 5 subjects, bronchial reactivity was determined at 9:00 and 11:30 A.M. on 4 consecutive days without exposure to ozone (Group I). In 7 other subjects (Group II), bronchial reactivity was assessed at 9:00 and 11:30 A.M. on 3 consecutive days, and subjects were exposed to 0.2 ppm of ozone from 9:30 to 11:30 A.M. on the third day. Seven additional subjects (Group III) had bronchial reactivity assessed in a similar fashion for 2 days and then again on 3 consecutive days of 2-h exposures to 0.4 ppm of ozone. Pre-exposure bronchial reactivity of the groups was the same, and no change in bronchial reactivity occurred in the group tested repeatedly but not exposed to ozone. An increase in delta SRaw provoked by histamine was noted after the first exposure to 0.4 ppm but not to 0.2 ppm of ozone (p less than 0.025). With 3 repeated 2-h exposures to 0.4 ppm on consecutive days, however, the delta SRaw produced by histamine progressively decreased, returning to pre-exposure values after the third exposure. Our results indicate that the threshold concentration of ozone causing an increase in bronchial reactivity in healthy human subjects is between 0.2 and 0.4 ppm, and that adaptation to this effect of ozone develops with repeated exposures. The threshold concentration of ozone identified in other studies as causing changes in symptoms, lung volumes, or airway resistance was also between 0.2 and 0.4 ppm, and the time course of the development of tolerance to ozone in these other studies was similar to hat observed in our study. We propose that the appearance of symptoms, changes in pulmonary function, and the increase in bronchial reactivity may be caused by a change in the activity of afferent nerve endings in the airway epithelium.",5.3.4,Alteration of Epithelial Barrier Function,0,0

Then animals from each group were sacrificed, and electron microscopic studies on the lung and biochemical examinations on the lung and liver were performed. 1) Vitamin E concentration in serum decreased following ozone exposure in the E-supplemented group, whereas it remained unaffected in the E-depleted group. 2) Both TBA value and % release of lysosomal enzyme (acid phosphatase) of the liver were increased in vitamin E-depleted air-exposed rats, and showed even higher values following ozone exposure. Levels of both components were highest in the vitamin E-depleted ozone-exposed rats, thus demonstrating that there are a marked increase in lipid peroxide and the increased labilization of lysosomes in this instance. 3) Arachidonic acid (20:4) of total lipid, phospholipid and lecithin in the lung tissue showed a tendency to decrease in vitamin E-depleted air-exposed rats. Those in the ozone-exposed animals showed in both groups a tendency to increase in total lipid and lecithin, and to decrease in phospholipid. However, a change in the fatty acid composition following ozone exposure was generally mild. 4) The fatty acid composition of phospholipid in lung washings did not show a remarkable change following ozone exposure in either group, thus suggesting that it has the resistivity to oxidation. 5) Morphological observations on the lung with the scanning and transmission electron microscopes did not reveal any clear differences between the two groups. The defensive effect of vitamin E on ozone toxicity induced by long-term exposure to ozone was not made clear by the morphological or biochemical examination of the lung.

Airway responsiveness and inflammation were assessed in anesthetized dogs before ozone exposure and then 1 h and 1 wk after ozone (2.1 ppm, 2 h). Airway responsiveness increased markedly at 1 h after ozone and returned to control levels 1 wk later in each of 6 dogs, but it did not change after ozone in another 4 dogs. Furthermore, dogs that became hyperresponsive also developed a marked and reversible increase in the number of neutrophils in the epithelium, whereas dogs that did not become hyperresponsive had no change in the number of neutrophils. For the group of dogs, the level of airway responsiveness before and after ozone exposure correlated closely with the number of epithelial neutrophils.

Measurements of lung mechanics, ventilatory response to exercise, and symptoms were obtained before and after exposure. O3 exposure alone resulted in significant changes in specific airway resistance, forced vital capacity (FVC), forced expiratory flow rates, tidal volume (VT), and respiratory rate (f). Atropine pretreatment prevented the significant increase in airway resistance with O3 exposure and partially blocked the decrease in forced expiratory flow rates but did not prevent a significant fall in FVC, changes in f and VT, or the frequency of reported respiratory symptoms after O3. These results suggest that the increase in pulmonary resistance during O3 exposure is mediated by a parasympathetic mechanism and that changes in other measured variables are mediated, at least partially, by mechanisms not dependent on muscarinic cholinergic receptors of the parasympathetic nervous system.",5.3.2,Activation of Neural Reflexes,0,0

Twenty-two 8-11 year old males were exposed in a similar manner to both air and 0.12 ppm O3. Measures of respiratory symptoms and function were made before and after exposure. Adults experienced an increase in the symptom cough and decrements in forced vital capacity and some measures of forced expiratory flow.

The present study defines the effects of ambient concentrations of ozone on the surface epithelium lining respiratory bronchioles and on the underlying bronchiolar interstitium in these same monkeys. Bonnet monkeys were exposed to filtered air or to 0.15 or 0.30 ppm ozone 8 hours/day for 6 or 90 days. At the end of exposures, monkeys were anesthetized and killed by exsanguination. Microdissected bronchiolar airways of infusion-fixed lungs were evaluated morphometrically by light microscopy and quantitatively by scanning and transmission electron microscopy for ozone-induced epithelial changes. Hyperplasia of nonciliated, cuboidal epithelial cells and intraluminal accumulation of macrophages characterized ozone-induced lesions in respiratory bronchioles. There were no significant differences in epithelial thickness or cell numbers among ozone-exposed groups. Ozone-exposed epithelium was composed of 80% cuboidal and 20% squamous cells compared with 40% cuboidal and 60% squamous cells in filtered air controls. In addition, the arithmetic mean thickness of the surface epithelium, a measure of tissue mass per unit area of basal lamina, was significantly increased in all of the ozone-exposed groups. The number of cuboidal epithelial cells per surface area of basal lamina was increased above control values by 780% after 6 days exposure to 0.15 ppm, 777% after 90 days to 0.15 ppm, and 996% after 90 days exposure to 0.30 ppm. There was also a significant ozone-induced increase in the thickness of the bronchiolar interstitium that was due to an increase in both cellular and acellular components. These results demonstrate that exposure to low ambient concentrations of ozone, near the current. National Ambient Air Quality Standard, induces pulmonary lesions in primates. The alterations do not appear to be concentration- or time-dependent, suggesting that the current National Ambient Air Quality Standard may be at or above the threshold for deep lung injury in primates.",5.3.7,Airways Remodeling,0,0

Subjective symptoms increased with O3 concentration. Statistically significant pulmonary function impairment observed at 0.20 ppm O3 suggests that endurance athletes may be more susceptible to the effects of a given O3 concentration than normal young adult males as a result of sustained high mean VE incurred during training and competition. Three subjects were unable to complete both the training and competitive simulations at 0.35 ppm O3.

When the dogs were not treated with indomethacin, ozone caused a marked increase in responsiveness to acetylcholine and a marked increase in the number of neutrophils in the airway epithelium. When the dogs were given indomethacin, responsiveness was no different during treatment than before treatment, but more importantly, responsiveness did not increase significantly after they were exposed to ozone. Interestingly, indomethacin treatment did not affect either the baseline number of epithelial neutrophils before ozone exposure or the increase in the number of neutrophils after exposure.

Sloughing of epithelial tissue, mucous formation and an accumulation of macrophages in the end-airways were more pronounced among ozone-exposed DS animals than in DR-ozone-exposed rats.

Thirty-two subjects were exposed to1 of 5 O3 concentrations (0.12, 0.18, 0.24, 0.30, or 0.40 ppm), and each underwent one or more repeat exposures separated by from 3 wk to 14 months. Magnitudes of change for pulmonary function variables, respiratory rate and tidal volume, and for reported symptoms were compared for the repeated exposures. Changes induced in forced expiratory spirometric measurements were highly reproducible for as long as 10 months and for all tested O3 concentrations of 0.18 ppm or greater. This high degree of reproducibility indicates that the magnitude of response to a single exposure is a precise estimate of that subject's intrinsic O3 responsiveness. We conclude that the previously observed intersubject variability in magnitude of O3-induced effects is the result of large differences in intrinsic responsiveness to O3.",6.2.1.1,Controlled Human Exposure,0,0

During exposures, subjects exercised (minute ventilation, 26.4 +/- 3.0 L/min) for 7.5 min every 30 min; ventilation and gas exchange measured during exercise showed no difference between exposure days. Pulmonary function tests (spirometry, body plethysmography) obtained before and after exposures were unchanged on the air day. On the ozone day the mean airway resistance and specific airway resistance showed the largest (25 and 22%) changes (p = 0.086 and 0.058, respectively). Arterial oxygen saturation (SaO2) obtained in 8 subjects during the last exercise interval showed a mean decrement of 0.95% on the ozone exposure day; this change did not attain significance (p = 0.074). Nevertheless, arterial oxygen desaturation may be a true consequence of low-level ozone exposure in this compromised patient group. As normal subjects undergoing exposures to ozone with slightly higher exercise intensities show a threshold for changes in their respiratory mechanics at approximately 0.3 ppm, our data indicate that persons with COPD are not unduly sensitive to the effects of low-level ozone exposure.",6.2.1.1,Controlled Human Exposure,0,0

The model was applied to human airway morphometric data. Values for the chemical and physical parameters that define the liquid tissue and blood compartments were based on reported experimental data. Simulation results illustrate the variability of results due to an uncertainty in the knowledge of transport parameters, liquid, tissue, and blood compartment thicknesses, and chemical reaction rates. Results were most sensitive to mucous compartment thickness and reaction rate constant and least sensitive to transport and blood parameters.

Twenty-three white males 8 to 11 yr of age were exposed once to clean air and once to 0.12 ppm O3 in random order. Exposures were for 2.5 h and included 2 h of intermittent heavy exercise. Measures of forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) and the symptom cough were determined prior to and after each exposure.

Therefore, it is important to determine if a prolonged exposure to low levels of ozone is also capable of causing cellular and biochemical changes in the lung. Nonsmoking males were randomly exposed to filtered air and either 0.10 ppm ozone or 0.08 ppm ozone for 6.6 h with moderate exercise (40 liters/min). Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) was performed 18 h after each exposure, and cells and fluid were analyzed. The BAL fluid of volunteers exposed to 0.10 ppm ozone had significant increases in neutrophils (PMNs), protein, prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), fibronectin, interleukin-6 (IL-6), and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) compared with BAL fluid from the same volunteers exposed to filtered air. In addition, there was a decrease in the ability of alveolar macrophages to phagocytize yeast via the complement receptor. Exposure to 0.08 ppm ozone resulted in significant increases in PMNs, PGE2, LDH, IL-6, alpha 1-antitrypsin, and decreased phagocytosis via the complement receptor. However, BAL fluid protein and fibronectin were no longer significantly elevated.

Lavage fluid protein (LFP) accumulation 18-20 h after exposure was used as the indicator of O3- and COCl2-induced pulmonary edema. All species had similar basal levels of LFP (250-350 mg/ml) when a volume of saline that approximated the total lung capacity was used to lavage the collapsed lungs. Ozone effects were most marked in guinea pigs, which showed significant effects at 0.2 ppm and above.

Samples of air were collected from the posterior pharynx through the tube and into a rapidly responding O3 analyzer yielding inspiratory and expiratory O3 concentrations in the posterior pharynx. The O3 removal efficiency of the extrathoracic airways was computed with the use of the inspiratory concentration and the chamber concentration, and intrathoracic removal efficiency was computed with the use of the inspiratory and expiratory concentrations. The mean extrathoracic removal efficiency for all measurements was 39.6 +/- 0.7% (SE), and the mean intrathoracic removal efficiency was 91.0 +/- 0.5%. Significantly less O3 was removed both extrathoracically and intrathoracically when subjects breathed at 24 breaths/min compared with 12 breaths/min (P less than 0.001). O3 concentration had no effect on extrathoracic removal efficiency, but there was a significantly greater intrathoracic removal efficiency at 0.4 ppm than at 0.1 ppm (P less than 0.05). Mode of breathing significantly affected extrathoracic removal efficiency, with less O3 removed during nasal breathing than during either mouth breathing or oronasal breathing (P less than 0.01).",5.2.2,Ozone Uptake ,0,0

Quantitative serial section analyses of vascular perfusion-fixed rat lungs were used to determine the anatomic dead space proximal to specific ventilatory units as well as the gas volume of these ventilatory untis. Three reconstructions, each consisting of ventilatory units distal to a specific bronchus, were carried out. The number of ventilatory untis for each reconstruction varied from 26 to 71. The average ventilatory unit volume for the three reconstructions [0.53 .+-. .03 (SE) mm3] was not significantly different from measurments based on random sampling. The distribution of ventilatory unit volume was diverse, with 15% of the population having a volume > 0.3 mm3 and 9% of the population having avolume > 1.0 mm3. For a gas of relatively low reactivity (e.g., oxygen) the predicted oxygen uptake per unit surface area did not vary significantly between ventilatory units. The predicted oxygen uptake was .apprx.92% of the uptake in the absence of gradients in oxygen concentration between ventilatory units. For a highly reactive gas (e.g., ozone), the predicted uptake per unit surface area in the proximal portions of larger ventilatory units was significantly greater than the average uptake.

The subjects were exposed to 0.4 ppm ozone for 1 hr during which time they walked on a treadmill at a speed and inclination sufficient to induce a minute ventilation (VE) of 20 liter/min/m2 body surface area. Prior to and immediately following exposure spirometric and plethysmographic measurements of lung function were made. In addition, 5 min after the beginning of exposure and 5 min before the end of exposure the uptake efficiency of ozone in the upper and lower respiratory tract, spontaneous tidal volume (Vt), and breathing frequency (f) were measured. During exposure subjects wore a noseclip in order to constrain breathing to the oral pathway. Uptake efficiencies in the upper (FURT) and lower (FLRT) respiratory tracts were determined by continuously drawing air from the posterior pharynx into a rapidly responding chemiluminescent ozone analyzer. Linear regression models were constructed to examine the relationships between pulmonary function and breathing pattern responses, and the instantaneous and average values of FLRT and VE. Initial VE and average VE (VE) were found to be significant predictors of FEV1 decrement (p = 0.011 and p = 0.006, respectively). In addition the cross-product term FLRT x VE was a significant predictor of Vt decrement (p = 0.02). These results suggest that delivered dose, as determined primarily by VE, is responsible for some of the intersubject variability of ozone response. The failure of FLRT to play a significant role may be due to the fact that it primarily reflects ozone uptake in the lung periphery distal to anatomical sites where the ozone response may be mediated.",5.2.2,Ozone Uptake ,0,0

The objective of the present study was to determine the effect of alternative respiratory flows between 150 and 1,000 ml/s. Uptake was expressed as the O-3 absorbed during a single breath relative to the amount of O-3 in the inhaled bolus (Lambda). Measurements of Lambda were correlated with the penetration volume of the bolus into the respiratory tract (Vp). Vp in the range of 20-70 ml was considered to indicate upper airways (UA), the Vp interval of 70-180 ml was identified as lower conducting airways (CA), and Vp > 180 ml was associated with the respiratory air spaces (RA). During quiet oral breathing at 250 ml/s, Lambda increased smoothly as Vp increased, with 50% of the inhaled O-3 absorbed in the UAs and the remainder absorbed within the CAs such that no O-3 reached the RAs. The effect of increasing the respiratory flow was to shift the Lambda-Vp distribution distally such that significantly less O-3 was absorbed in the UAs and CAs and some O-3 reached the RAs. For example, at 1,000 ml/s, only 10% of the inhaled O-3 was absorbed in UAs and 65% was absorbed in the CAs such that 25% reached the RAs. Further analysis of these data with a mathematical diffusion model suggested that the reaction between O-3 and biochemical substrates is so fast (i.e., estimated 1st-order rate constant was on the order of 10(6) s(-1)) that O-3 is decomposed close to the gas-mucus interface in the CAs.",5.2.2,Ozone Uptake ,0,0

An ozone (O3) dosimetry model was then used to estimate the regional and local uptake of O3 in the (theoretical) LRT of children and adults. For sedentary or quiet breathing, the LRT distribution of absorbed O3, the percent uptake (84 to 88%) and the centriacinar O3 tissue dose are not very sensitive to age. For maximal work during exercise, predicted LRT uptakes range from 87 to 93%, and the regional percent uptakes are more dependent on age than during quiet breathing.

Comparison of this result to a published value of about 40% nasopharyngeal removal in the resting human, yields the conclusion that the O3 concentration in the rat trachea is about 30% higher than in the the human trachea under similar exposure conditions.",5.2.2.3,Upper Respiratory Tract Ozone Removal and Dose,0,0

NPSH contents were increased markedly in hamsters, mice and rats, but not in guinea pigs. The activities of antioxidative protective enzymes also changed with the exposure. The most characteristic change was the significant increase in glutathione peroxidase (GPx-H2O2) activity in hamsters and rats - species which did not exhibit increases in their TBA reactant levels. The increase in this enzyme activity in mice was significant, but not very large. Furthermore, guinea pigs were genetically deficient in this enzyme, and the increase in glycolytic enzymes for regenerating NADPH was also lowest in guinea pigs. The glutathione S-transferase (GSH-Tase) activity in mice and guinea pigs was decreased by exposure to the combined gases. These results suggest that the increases in lipid peroxide levels in mice and guinea pigs may be due to a lesser ability to regenerate protective reducing substances, such as NPSH and NADPH, than that of hamsters and rats.

We examined the cellular inflammatory responses in the nasal cavity and lower respiratory tract by means of nasal and bronchoalveolar lavage and morphometric quantitation of neutrophils within the nasal mucosa and pulmonary terminal bronchioloalveolar duct regions (i.e., centriacinar). Rats were exposed to 0.0, 0.12, 0.8, or 1.5 ppm ozone for 6 hr and were sacrificed immediately or 3, 18, 42, or 66 hr following exposure. Eighteen hours after exposure, increased numbers of neutrophils, as compared to controls, were recovered from nasal lavage fluid (NLF) of rats exposed to 0.12 ppm ozone. There was no change in the number of neutrophils recovered from bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) at any time after exposure. Rats exposed to 0.8 ppm ozone had more neutrophils in NLF than controls immediately after exposure, but no concomitant increase in BALF neutrophils at that time. However, as the number of neutrophils in BALF increased (maximum at 42 hr), the number of neutrophils recovered from NLF decreased (minimum at 42 hr). Rats exposed to 1.5 ppm ozone had no significant increases in nasal neutrophils in NLF at any time after exposure but had greatly increased numbers of neutrophils in BALF 3, 18, and 42 hr after exposure. The number of neutrophils recovered by nasal and bronchoalveolar lavage accurately reflected the tissue neutrophil response at sites within the nasal cavity and lung that were injured by acute ozone exposure. Our results suggest that at high ozone concentrations (0.8 and 1.5 ppm), the acute nasal inflammatory response is attenuated by a simultaneous, competing, inflammatory response within the centriacinar region of the lung. Analysis of nasal lavage fluid for changes in cellular composition may be a useful indicator of acute exposure to ambient levels of ozone, but at higher ozone levels, the nasal cellular inflammatory response may underestimate the effects of ozone on nasal and pulmonary epithelia.",5.3.3,Initiation of inflammation,0,0

Separate 6.6-h chamber exposures to 0.00, 0.08, 0.10, and 0.12 ppm O3 included six 50-min periods of moderate exercise (E = 39 L/min, HR ? 115 bpm, and O2 = 1.5 L/min).

Over a 3-wk period (June-July 1987) children who were attending a summer camp in the San Bernardino mountains of California performed spirometry up to three times per day during their stay at the camp. A total of 43 children were tested a total of 461 times. Ozone, oxides of nitrogen, sulfur dioxide, temperature, and relative humidity were measured continuously. Daily average measurements of total suspended particulate and the PM10 particulate fraction (less than or equal to 10 microns) were also made. Hourly ozone concentrations at the time of testing varied between 20 and 245 ppb. Regressions of each individual's FEV1 and FVC supported the view that high ozone levels reduced these lung function parameters. The average regression coefficient for FEV1 on ozone was -0.39 ml/ppb (SEM = 0.12) and for FVC -0.44 ml/ppb (SEM = 0.15), both of which were significantly different from zero. Statistical allowance for temperature and humidity increased the magnitude of these slopes. Nitrogen dioxide never exceeded 40 ppb during the time of testing and averaged 13 ppb. Sulfur dioxide's highest measurement was 8 ppb and often was at the limit of detection. Neither NO2 nor SO2 was considered in the statistical modeling. Data were divided based on whether each subject had been exposed to levels of ozone in excess of the National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS) during the several hours previous to being tested. Exposures exceeding the NAAQS indicated a significant negative relationship between ozone and FEV1, FVC, and PEFR. Data for nonexceedance periods did not indicate this negative relationship for any of the three lung function parameters, but it could not be determined if this was due to an absence of an ozone effect or to a combination of the increased variability and decreased size of this data subset. These data indicate that lung function changes on a daily basis relate in a negative fashion to ambient ozone levels. The magnitude of the changes are small and are reversed as ambient ozone decreases.",6.2.1.2,Epidemiology,3.1.4.1.3,Epidemiologic Studies

However, the results of a 6.6-h face-mask exposure to 0.08 ppm O3, compared to some previous chamber exposure study results, revealed several small incongruities that may be due primarily to high individual subject ""noise"" in responses to a relatively low O3 exposure. To resolve these differences, it was the primary purpose of this study to compare chamber exposure responses to those elicited via face-mask exposure to 0.08 ppm O3 for 6.6 h with subjects serving as their own controls. Two types of O3 exposure patterns were used: (1) the usual square-wave profile, and (2) an acute triangular profile, in which O3 concentration was increased each hour from 0.03 ppm to 0.15 ppm during h 4 and then decreased each hour to 0.05 ppm (mean = 0.08 ppm). Thirty young adults (15 of each gender) served as subjects. The two exposure methods (i.e., face mask and chamber) yielded near identical total inhaled O3 doses in both the square-wave and triangular exposure profiles, and produced very similar postexposure pulmonary function, symptoms, and exercise ventilatory pattern responses. However, pulmonary function and symptoms responses became statistically significant from preexposure at the end of h 4 (when [O3] = 0.15 ppm) in the triangular protocols, but not until h 6 in the square-wave protocols.

Rats were exposed for 1, 3, 13, and 78 weeks. Additional groups of rats exposed for 13 or 78 weeks were allowed to recover in filtered clean air for 6 or 17 weeks, respectively. Rats exposed to filtered air for the same lengths of time were used as controls. Samples from proximal alveolar regions and terminal bronchioles were obtained by microdissection. Analysis of the proximal alveolar region revealed a biphasic response. Acute tissue reactions after 1 week of exposure included epithelial inflammation, interstitial edema, interstitial cell hypertrophy, and influx of macrophages. These responses subsided after 3 weeks of exposure. Progressive epithelial and interstitial tissue responses developed with prolonged exposure and included epithelial hyperplasia, fibroblast proliferation, and interstitial matrix accumulation. The epithelial responses involved both type I and type II epithelial cells. Alveolar type I cells increased in number, became thicker, and covered a smaller average surface area. These changes persisted throughout the entire exposure and did not change during the recovery period, indicating the sensitivity of these cells to injury. The main response of type II epithelial cells was cell proliferation. The accumulation of interstitial matrix after chronic exposure consisted of deposition of both increased amounts of basement membrane and collagen fibers. Interstitial matrix accumulation underwent partial recovery during follow-up periods in air; however, the thickening of the basement membrane did not resolve. Analysis of terminal bronchioles showed that short-term exposure to O3 caused a loss of ciliated cells and differentiation of preciliated and Clara cells. The bronchiolar cell population stabilized on continued exposure; however, chronic exposure resulted in structural changes, suggesting injury to both ciliated and Clara cells. We conclude that chronic exposure to low levels of O3 causes epithelial inflammation and interstitial fibrosis in the proximal alveolar region and bronchiolar epithelial cell injury.",5.3.7,Airways Remodeling,0,0

The rats were exposed to either air or 0.8 ppm O3 for 3 or 7 days, or to 0.8 ppm O3 for 3 days followed by a 4-day exposure to air. The effects of the exposures were determined by quantitating the hyperplastic (epithelial nuclei/mm basal lamina) and secretory metaplastic changes (volume densities of acidic and neutral mucosubstances) within the nasal nonciliated cuboidal epithelium (NNCE). There were no significant changes in NNCE cell numeric density, or in the volume density of intraepithelial mucus, compared to air-exposed control rats, in rats exposed to O3 for 3 days and sacrificed 18 h later.

There were no significant differences in NNCE cell hyperplasia or secretory metaplasia between these two experimental groups. Three 6 h/day exposures to 0.8 ppm O3 triggered hyperplastic and metaplastic changes within rat NNCE that were indistinguishable from those produced by seven 6 h/day exposures to the same concentration of O3.

Since regulatory standards and economic valuations typically assume some threshold level, we evaluated the fundamental question of the impact of exposure misclassification on the persistence of underlying personal-level thresholds when personal data are aggregated to the population level in the assessment of exposure-response relationships. As an example, we measured personal exposures to two particle metrics, PM(2.5) and sulfate (SO(4)(2-)), for a sample of lung disease patients and compared these with exposures estimated from ambient measurements. Previous work has shown that ambient:personal correlations for PM(2.5) are much lower than for SO(4)(2-), suggesting that ambient PM(2.5) measurements misclassify exposures to PM(2.5). We then developed a method by which the measured:estimated exposure relationships for these patients were used to simulate personal exposures for a larger population and then to estimate individual-level mortality risks under different threshold assumptions. These individual risks were combined to obtain the population risk of death, thereby exhibiting the prominence (and the value) of the threshold in the relationship between risk and estimated exposure. Our results indicated that for poorly classified exposures (PM(2.5) in this example) population-level thresholds were apparent at lower ambient concentrations than specified common personal thresholds, while for well-classified exposures (e.g., SO(4)(2-)), the apparent thresholds were similar to these underlying personal thresholds. These results demonstrate that surrogate metrics that are not highly correlated with personal exposures obscure the presence of thresholds in epidemiological studies of larger populations, while exposure indicators that are highly correlated with personal exposures can accurately reflect underlying personal thresholds.",4.6,Implications for Epidemiologic Studies,0,0

The distribution of nasal lesions is generally a consequence of regional deposition of the inhaled material, local tissue susceptibility, or a combination of these factors. Nasal uptake and regional deposition are influenced by numerous factors including the physical and chemical properties of the inhaled material, such as water solubility and reactivity; airborne concentration and length of exposure; the presence of other air contaminants such as particulate matter; nasal metabolism, and blood and mucus flow. For certain highly water-soluble or reactive gases, nasal airflow patterns play a major role in determining lesion distribution. Studies of nasal airflow in rats and monkeys, using casting and molding techniques combined with a water-dye model, indicate that nasal airflow patterns are responsible for characteristic differences in the distribution of nasal lesions induced by formaldehyde in these species. Local tissue susceptibility is also a complex issue that may be a consequence of many factors, including physiologic and metabolic characteristics of the diverse cell populations that comprise each of the major epithelial types lining the airways. Identification of the principal factors that influence the distribution and nature of nasal lesions is important when attempting the difficult process of determining potential human risks using data derived from laboratory animals.

For a bilayer the calculations suggest that most of the ozone reacts within a bilayer, but a fraction may exit unreacted. For the lung lining fluid layer (LLFL), the calculations show that ozone cannot cross this layer without reacting where the LLFL is thicker than about 0.1 ?m. However, since the LLFL varies from 20 to 0.1 ?m in thickness with patchy areas in the lower airways that are virtually uncovered, some ozone could reach underlying cells, particularly in the lower airways. For cells (such as alveolar type I epithelial cells), the calculations show that ozone reacts within the cell too rapidly to pass through and exit unreacted from the other side.

These calculations have implications for ozone toxicity. In vivo, the toxicity of ozone is suggested to result from the effects of a cascade of products that are produced in the reactions of ozone with primary target molecules that lie close to the air/tissue boundary. These products, which have a lower reactivity and longer lifetime than ozone itself, can transmit the effects of ozone beyond the air/tissue interface. The variation in thickness of the LLFL may modulate the species causing damage to the cells below it. In the lower airways, where the LLFL is thin and patchy, more cellular damage may be caused by ozone itself; in the upper airways where the LLFL is thicker, secondary products (such as aldehydes and hydrogen peroxide) may cause most of the damage. In vitro studies must be designed in an attempt to model the lung physiology. For example, if cells in culture are studied, and if the cells are exposed to ozone while under a supporting medium solution that contains ozone-reactive substances, then the cells may be damaged by products that are formed in the reactions of ozone with the cell medium rather than by ozone itself.

The association between personal and ambient O3 was highly significant (mixed model slope p < 0.0001). The personal/ambient ratio was not constant, so use of the outdoor monitor would not be appropriate to rank O3 exposure and evaluate health effects between workers.

A comprehensive climatology of stratosphere-troposphere exchange (STE), based on 15 years of ECMWF global atmospheric reanalysis data for the period 1979-1993, has been carried out with a specially tuned version of the Lagrangian particle dispersion model, FLEXPART. The typical amplitudes, timescales, seasonality, and spatial variability of STE revealed in the climatology are described. Mean distributions of STE air masses of various ages relate to aspects of the global circulation, while anomaly patterns, such as the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) and El Nino, influence STE variability. Characteristic differences are seen between shallow STE flows remaining within the tropopause region (TPR) and deep STE transports, which include cases of stratospheric air reaching the lower troposphere. Unlike for shallow STE events, such deep intrusions show a distinct winter maximum. This subsequently impacts on the seasonal cycle of stratospheric ozone in the troposphere, which thus depends on altitude but also on the decay timescale of ozone. A much broader view of STE than has previously been possible is enabled. The inherent scope of STE is far wider than a discussion of cross-tropopause fluxes alone. Indeed, more than 90% of all cross-tropopause flows return within 6 hours. It is thus crucial to distinguish between short-term STE, during which air parcels rapidly recross the tropopause, and deep and/or long-term STE, in which air parcels have subsequently long residence times away from their source.",3.4.1.1,Contributions from the Stratosphere,0,0

A global positioning system and a diary provided location and activity information. Average pollutant levels inside the cars were low compared to ambient air quality standards: carbon monoxide 2.7 ppm, nitrogen dioxide 41.7 Ag/m3, ozone 11.7 ppb, particulate matter smaller 2.5 Am (PM2.5) 24 Ag/m3. Volatile organic compounds inside the cars were in the ppb-range and showed the fingerprint of gasoline. PM2.5 was 24% lower than ambient and roadside levels, probably due to depositions associated with the recirculating air conditioning. Levels of carbon monoxide, aldehydes, hydrocarbons, and some metals (Al, Ca, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Cu, and Sr) were highest in the cars, and roadside levels were higher than ambient levels.

It is therefore hypothesized that mucus provides a major resistance to ozone mass transport in the URT. As part of a larger project to predict health risks of inhaled gases, a previously developed, computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model of the Fischer 344 (F344) rat nasal passage was modified to describe transport of ozone. In this study, mass-transfer resistance in the nasal lining was incorporated into the CFD model for prediction of ozone dosimetry. Static mucus and tissue layers were considered. A boundary condition was developed that incorporates mass-transfer resistance in the nasal lining due to one-dimensional diffusion and first-order reaction in the mucus and tissue phases. Physicochemical parameters for ozone were obtained from the literature. Resistance to mass transfer in the submucosal region (blood phase) was neglected due to high tissue-phase reactivity (i.e., the concentration of inhaled chemical in blood was set to zero). To study the possibility that differences in the thickness and/or quality (variation in physicochemical properties) of mucus coating the transitional and respiratory epithelium account for reported patterns of injury, a simulation was performed into which regional differences in mucus thickness were incorporated. Result suggest that mass-transfer resistance in the
mucus phase is important for describing ozone dosimetry in the URT. In addition, mucus thickness may play a role in determining the pattern of ozone-induced nasal lesions.",5.2.3,Ozone Reactions and Reaction Products,0,0

These effects can be reduced via pretreatment with anti-inflammatory agents. Progesterone, a gonadal steroid, is known to reduce general inflammation in the uterine endometrium. However, it is not known whether fluctuations in blood levels of progesterone, which are experienced during the normal female menstrual cycle, could alter O3 inflammatory-induced pulmonary responses. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that young, adult females are more responsive to O3 inhalation with respect to pulmonary function impairment during their follicular (F) menstrual phase when progesterone levels are lowest than during their mid-luteal (ML) phase when progesterone levels are highest. Nine subjects with normal ovarian function were exposed in random order for 1 hr each to filtered air and to 0.30 ppm O3 in their F and ML menstrual phases. Ozone responsiveness was measured by percent change in pulmonary function from pre- to postexposure. Significant gas concentration effects (filtered air versus O3) were observed for forced vital capacity (FVC), forced expiratory volume in 1 sec (FEV1), and forced expiratory flow between 25 and 75% of FVC (FEF25-75; p &lt; .05). More importantly, the pulmonary function flow rates, FEV1 and FEF25-75, showed a significant menstrual phase and gas concentration interaction effect, with larger decrements observed in the F menstrual phase when progesterone concentrations were significantly lower.

Our hypothesis is that ozone, as a powerful oxidant, will diminish the activity of neutral endopeptidase (NEP) in the airways of humans with resulting increased concentrations of neuropeptides such as substance P (SP). We have exposed seven (two women, five men) healthy, nonsmoking individuals (22 to 30 yr of age) to filtered air and ozone (0.25 ppm) for 1 h in an environmental chamber during heavy exercise. Bronchoscopy with airway lavage (AL) and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) was performed immediately after ozone exposure. The lavage samples were analyzed by enzyme immunoassay for SP and 8-epi-prostaglandin F2 alpha (8-epi-PGF2 alpha) (a marker for oxidative free radical reaction) and by radioimmunoassay for complement fragments. FEV1 had declined 12.4 +/- 1.9% (mean +/- SEM) as a result of ozone exposure. The AL concentration for SP and 8-epi-PGF2 alpha and BAL concentration of C3a after ozone exposure were significantly higher than after the filtered air exposure (P < 0.05). There was a significant correlation between SP and 8-epi-PGF2 alpha concentrations in the AL fluid (r2 = 0.89 and P < 0.05). There were no changes in C5a in either compartment or any of the mediators in the plasma samples. These results extend previous results from animal studies suggesting that ozone's mechanism of action is through an oxidative reaction resulting in a decreased activity of NEP in the airways with a subsequent increase in the concentration and activity of SP.",5.3.2,Activation of Neural Reflexes,0,0

Ozone O3 exposure also causes decreased forced vital capacity (FVC) and forced expiratory volume after 1 s (FEV(1)), associated with cough and substernal pain on inspiration, and small increases in specific airway resistance (SRAW). The spirometric decrements are substantially blunted by pretreatment with indomethacin. Since the O3-induced decrement in FVC is due to involuntary inhibition  of  inspiration,  a role for stimulation of nociceptive respiratory tract afferents has been suggested and cyclo-oxygenase products have been hypothesized to mediate this stimulation. However, the relation (if any) between the O3-induced neutrophilic airways inflammation and decreased inspiratory capacity remains unclear. We studied the effects of pharmacologic  inhibition  of  O3-induced spirometric changes on the inflammatory changes. Each of ten healthy men was exposed twice (5-week interval) to 0.4 ppm O3 for 2 h, including 1 h of intermittent exercise (ventilation 601*min(-1)). One-and-a-half hours prior to and midway during each exposure the subject ingested 800 mg and 200 mg, respectively, of the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug ibuprofen (IBU), or placebo [PLA (sucrose)], in randomized, double-blind fashion. Spirometry and body plethysmography were performed prior to drug administration, and before and after O3 exposure. Immediately following postexposure testing, fiberoptic bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) was performed. Neither IBU nor PLA administration changed pre-exposure lung function. O3 exposure (with PLA) caused a significant 17 percent mean decrement in FEV(1) (P <0.01) and a 56 percent increase in mean SRAW. Following IBU pretreatment, O3 exposure induced a significantly lesser mean decrement in FEV(1) (7 percent) but still a 50 percent increase in mean SRAW. IBU pretreatment significantly decreased post-O3 BAL levels of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) by 60.4 percent (P <0.05) and thromboxane B(2) (TxB(2)) by 25.5 percent (P <0.05). Of the proteins, only interleukin-6 was significantly reduced (45 percent, P <0.05) by IBU as compared to PLA pretreatment. As expected, O3 exposure produced neutrophilia in BALF. There was, however, no effect of IBU on this finding. None of the major cell types in the BALF differed significantly between pretreatments. We found no association between post-exposure changes of BALF components and pulmonary function decrements. We conclude that IBU causes significant inhibition of O3-induced increases in respiratory tract PGE(2) and TxB(2) levels concomitant with a blunting of the spirometric response. This is consistent with the hypothesis that the products of AA metabolism mediate inhibition of inspiration. However, IBU did not alter the modest SRAW response to O3.",5.3.2,Activation of Neural Reflexes,0,0

Five UV-type and two chemiluminescence-type monitors were employed in this study. The results of the study indicate that in systems containing ozone, water vapor and zero air only, the UV-based monitors showed negligible effects due to humidity. On average, the UV monitors were within 0.5 percent of independently determined ozone values judged to be extremely accurate. The chemiluminescence-based monitors showed systematically higher readings than the UV monitors with added water vapor. The effect was found to be linear with water vapor concentration with an average positive deviation of 3.0 percent per percent H2O at 25 degrees C. For these measurement, ozone concentrations ranged from 85 to 320 ppbv and water concentrations from 1 to 3 percent (i.e., dew point temperatures from 9 to 24 degrees C). These results are largely in agreement with previous studies conducted to measure this interference, although the present study extends the range of water concentrations tested. Studies were also performed with a smog chamber with simulated polluted air (containing paraffinic, olefinic and aromatic hydrocarbon precursors) and varying relative humidities. Although the presence of water vapor did not appear to represent a substantial interference in these systems, a positive interference was observed with the UV monitors. This interference was likely a result of the presence of toluene and some of its aromatic photooxidation products (e.g., benzaldehyde), which can be partially removed from the reference stream by the ozone scrubber within the UV monitor. If the compound absorbs radiation at 254 nm, it is detected as ozone. However, when the results are scaled back to ambient concentrations of toluene and NO(x), the effect appears to be very minor (ca. 3 percent under the study conditions). It is concluded that under atmospheric conditions at moderate pollution and relative humidity levels, both types of instruments can give accurate measurements of the ozone concentration.

The SCCTM includes vertical transport by convection, turbulent mixing, a flexible photochemical scheme, and interactive calculations of radiative fluxes and photolysis rates. The model is designed as a chemical and physical core to be used in a completely interactive GCM. At this time it is driven by data from the GEOS Data Assimilation System archived by the Data Assimilation Office at NASA Goddard. We simulated an ozone/aerosol pollution episode in the Baltimore-Washington region and a convective event in the central United States. These physically distinct case studies provide a thorough test for the chemical scheme and physical parameterizations employed in the SCCTM. The ozone episode simulation showed strong sensitivity to aerosol optical depth, with increased average PBL ozone due to the effects of aerosols on photolysis rates. Observed aerosols produced a surface cooling of up to 100 W m -2 and stabilized the atmosphere suppressing convection. In the convective event over Oklahoma a squall line carried pollutants into the free troposphere increasing O3 by up to 35 ppbv and peroxyacetylnitrate by up to 400 pptv.

Subjects were also exposed once to filtered air. Volunteers exercised at a ventilation of similar to 39 L/min for 50 min of each hour during the exposure.

Indeed, nasal turbinate tissue was found to contain uric acid. However, careful analysis of nasal turbinate tissue failed to reveal the presence of xanthine oxidase, the enzyme responsible for uric acid synthesis. These data suggest that uric acid might be taken up secondarily by glands from plasma. This possibility was strengthened by the observation that lowering the plasma urate level with probenecid concomitantly lowered urate secretion.

Early morning ozone mixing ratios measured by the aircraft were similar to 70 parts per billion (ppb), while those measured by surface instrumentation were similar to 25 ppb. Corresponding to growth of the morning turbulent layer, surface ozone values steadily increased with time until they matched the 70 ppb values aloft by midmorning. The mixing ratios of isoprene at altitudes above the surface increased by several orders of magnitude with the onset of turbulence at each measurement altitude. The slope of O-3 as a function of NOy for each of the flight legs was also sensitive to the presence of turbulence. Measurements from nonturbulent flight legs yielded slopes that were considerably steeper than those from measurements made in turbulence. This study shows that the concentration of ozone precursors aloft is clearly dependent on the presence of turbulence, and turbulent mixing could explain the evolution of ozone concentrations at the surface. In general, conclusions regarding pollutant concentrations must account for both chemical and local dynamic processes.",3.2,Physical and Chemical Processes,0,0

The concentration jumps of ozone are on the order of  ? to 3/4 of the days maximum and the level is significantly higher than under normal conditions with stable stratification. The cases are correlated with an increase in wind speed, wind shear and a downward flux of ozone. In the case selected here, the increase in turbulence is caused by the evolution of a low-level jet (LLJ) with the core just above the top of surface inversion. The analysis of wind profile measurements at the aerological stations in north-eastern Germany reveals a spatial extension of the low-level jet of up to 600 km in length and 200 km in width. Thus the significance of the LLJ on the transport capability of the atmosphere is twofold: due to the large spatial extent of the LLJ and the high wind speed at the jet core level air pollutants are transported over hundreds of kilometers during one night. Secondly, due to the strong wind shear between the jet core and the ground pollutants can be mixed to the ground far away from the release area.",3.2,Physical and Chemical Processes,0,0

Three-dimensional air motion sensing instrumentation and fast-response ozone and condensation nuclei analysers on board research aircraft permit the quantitative evaluation of the turbulent flux of chemical constituents across the tropopause. The observations reveal that tropopause folds are mixing regions whose chemical characteristics lie somewhere in between those of the troposphere and the stratosphere. The temporal changes of ozone and condensation nuclei brought about through the vertical flux divergence of these quantities suggest that turbulent mixing processes are of first-order importance as a mechanism for stratospheric-tropospheric exchange in the vicinity of jet stream-frontal zone-associated topopause folds.,3.4.1.1,Contributions from the Stratosphere,0,0

Rhesus monkeys were exposed to a regimen of HDMA and/or ozone or filtered air for 6 mo. To detect structural changes in the BMZ, we measured immunoreactivity of collagen I. To detect functional changes in the BMZ, we measured perlecan and fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF-2). We also measured components of the FGF-2 ternary signaling complex [fibroblast growth factor receptor-1 (FGFR-1) and syndecan-4]. The width of the BMZ was irregular in the ozone groups, suggesting atypical development of the BMZ. Perlecan was also absent from the BMZ. In the absence of perlecan, FGF-2 was not bound to the BMZ. However, FGF-2 immunoreactivity was present in basal cells, the lateral intercellular space (LIS), and attenuated fibroblasts. FGFR-1 immunoreactivity was downregulated, and syndecan-4 immunoreactivity was upregulated in the basal cells. This suggests that FGF-2 in basal cells and LIS may be bound to the syndecan-4. We conclude that ozone and HDMA plus ozone effected incorporation of perlecan into the BMZ, resulting in atypical development of the BMZ. These changes are associated with specific alterations in the regulation of FGF-2, FGFR-1, and syndecan-4 in the airway epithelial-mesenchymal trophic unit, which may be associated with the developmental problems of lungs associated with exposure to ozone.",5.4.2.4,Lifestage,0,0

The Fifth-Generation Pennsylvania State University/National Center for Atmospheric Research Mesoscale Model (MM5) is utilized coupled on-line with a simple sulfur chemistry mechanism. Our numerical simulations show that there are three regions where significant binary homogeneous nucleation occurs. One region is in convective outflow where high anthropogenic SO2 concentration transported upward and low air temperature in the free troposphere (FT) favor the binary homogeneous nucleation of sulfuric acid gas and water vapor. The second region is near the top of marine boundary layer (MBL) clouds. The third region is in the clear FT at 500-600 hPa. In the three regions, significant nucleation events are all connected with relative humidity (RH) higher than 60%. For the northwest Atlantic we found that homogeneous nucleation generally occurs from the late morning through the afternoon on the northwest side of our simulation domain where anthropogenic SO2 concentration is high enough to produce sufficient sulfuric acid gas through the oxidation by OH radical. Significant nucleation does not necessarily happen in regions with very low preexisting particle surface area in our simulated cases. Our simulated total aerosol number concentrations in regions with significant new particle formation are generally consistent with field measurements. Nucleation rates are enhanced by NH3 especially in the MEL. Sensitivity tests show that a grid of 10 km (and time step of 30 s) yielded significantly higher nucleation as compared with a grid size of 30 km (and time step of 90 s).

Two approaches are examined. A mass balance approach accounts for mixing effects within the boundary layer and is used to calculate effective boundary layer removal rates for NOx and SO and to estimate net OPE. Net OPE is more directly comparable to photochemical model results than previous measurement-based estimates. Derived net production efficiencies from mass balance range from 1 to 3 molecules of ozone produced per molecule of NOx emitted. A concentration ratio approach provides an estimate of removal rates of primary emissions relative to a tracer species. This approach can be combined with emissions ratio information to provide upper limit estimates of OPE that range from 2 to 7.

This background is defined as those concentrations that would exist in the absence of North American emissions. Lefohn et al. [2001] have argued that frequent occurrences of O3 concentrations above 50-60 ppbv at remote northern U.S. sites in spring are of stratospheric origin, challenging the EPA background estimate and implying that the current O3 standard (84 ppbv, 8-hour average) may be unattainable. We show that a 3-D global model of tropospheric chemistry reproduces much of the observed variability in U.S. surface O3 concentrations, including the springtime high-O3 events, with only a minor stratospheric contribution (always <20 ppbv). We conclude that the previous interpretations of a stratospheric source for these events underestimated the role of regional and hemispheric pollution. While stratospheric intrusions might occasionally elevate surface O3 at high-altitude sites, our results indicate that these events are rare and would not compromise the O3 air quality standard. We find that the O3 background is generally 15-35 ppbv, with some incidences of 40-50 ppbv in the west in spring at high-elevation sites (>2 km). It declines from spring to summer and further decreases during O3 pollution episodes. The 40 ppbv background assumed by EPA thus actually underestimates the risk associated with O3 during polluted conditions. A better definition would represent background as a function of season, altitude, and total surface O3 concentration. Natural O3 levels are typically 10-25 ppbv and never exceed 40 ppbv. International controls to reduce the hemispheric pollution background would facilitate compliance with an AOT40-type standard (cumulative exposure to O3 above 40 ppbv) in the United States.",3.2.2,Gas Phase Reactions Leading to O3 Formation,1.8.1,Modeling Strategies Applied to Estimate U.S. Background (USB) Ozone

This model is used to investigate the sensitivity of tropospheric ozone with respect to (1) changes in the anthropogenic emission of nitrogen oxides and nonmethane hydrocarbons, (2) increases in methane concentrations, (3) variations in the stratospheric source of ozone, (4) changes in solar radiation resulting from stratospheric ozone depletion, and (5) increases in tropospheric temperatures. Model results indicate that local increases in NOX emissions have caused most of the increases seen in lower tropospheric ozone over Europe and Japan. Increases in methane are responsible for roughly one fifth of the anthropogenically induced increase in tropospheric ozone at northern midlatitudes. However, changes in ozone precursors do not adequately explain either the spatial differences in observed ozone trends across midlatitudes or the observed decreases in ozone over Canada throughout the troposphere. We argue that ozone depletion in the lowermost stratosphere is likely to have reduced the stratospheric source by as much as 30% from the early 1970s to the mid 1990s. Model simulations that account for such a reduction along with reported changes in anthropogenic emissions show steep declines of ozone in the upper troposphere and variable increases in the lower troposphere that are more consistent with observations. Differential temperature trends in summer between North America and Europe may account for at least some of the remaining spatial variation in tropospheric ozone trends.

Correlations among O3, potential temperature (theta), the scattering Angstrom exponent (alpha), and relative humidity (RH) suggest that high concentrations of O3 and relatively large, internally mixed sulfate and black carbon (BC) particles were produced in the LFT. Conversely, the PBL contained less O3 and more externally mixed, primary sulfate and BC particles than the LFT.

A high-O3 episode occurring in late September was associated with only 0.34 ppbv H202, indicative of hydrocarbon-limited conditions. A seasonal transition in photochemical regime over the eastern United States in September would be expected from theory; the production rate of odd hydrogen radicals decreases by a factor of 2 over the course of the month, due to decreasing UV radiation and humidity, allowing 11NO3 production to become the dominant sink for odd hydrogen in the boundary layer and resulting in hydrocarbon- limited conditions for O3 production.

The previously identified NOx-VOC transition values for indicators appear to be valid for moderately polluted conditions with 80-150 ppb O3.

We further examined these indicators in a three-dimensional grid model. We proposed several new indicators including [H2O2]/([O3]+[NO2]), [O3]/[NOx], and a measure using the OH rate constant weighted concentrations of NO2 and hydrocarbons. Our analysis also supports the use of several indicators previously proposed by other researchers, including [O3]/[HNO3] and [H2O2]/[HNO3]. We found that [HCHO]/[NO2] was more useful than the previously proposed [HCHO]/[NOx]. We found that the indicators easily distinguished extremely NOx-limited or extremely radical-limited regimes but did not reliably distinguish conditions closer to the transition between these two regimes. We propose that a combined analysis using photochemical model simulations and a large set of indicators of both [O3] sensitivity and local odd oxygen production (P(Ox)) sensitivity to VOC and NOx provides the most complete and useful description of [O3] sensitivity. Time series of the indicators, at least from mid-morning to late afternoon, provide useful information about the evolution of [O3] sensitivity during the day. Values of the indicators change depending on the [O3] level due in part to the effects of miscellaneous OH and HO2 termination reactions and to the effects of the composition of the HC mixture on P(Ox).

52413,,,,Ozone as a function of local wind speed and direction: Evidence of local and regional transport,"Husar, RB; Renard, WP",1998,"Atmospheric conditions can exert a powerful influence on the distribution of pollutant concentrations in space and time. Low wind speeds lead to the buildup of high local pollutant concentrations. Strong ventilation with high wind speeds prevents the local build-up near the sources, but contributes to long-range transport and regional ozone particularly during directionally persistent wind conditions. In this work, the dependence of ozone concentration on transport is analyzed by classifying the existing ozone concentration data into wind direction and wind speed bins, followed by concentration averaging in each bin. Given a ten year (1986--1995) sampling record, the dependence of ozone on wind direction and wind speed has been extracted statistically from the climatological records. It was found that for southern urban areas, where episodes are caused by local stagnation, ozone levels decline rapidly with increasing wind speed. In northern cities, more heavily influenced by transport, ozone levels decrease much less rapidly, with increasing wind speeds. Tropospheric background levels of ozone are found at nearly all of the borders of the OTAG domain, with the exception of the Windsor-Quebec corridor. The wind directional analysis indicates that high ozone concentrations in excess of the tropospheric background originate from within the OTAG region. Furthermore, the high ozone concentration regions roughly coincide with the pattern of anthropogenic precursor emissions as modified by atmospheric dispersion. Consequently, it can be inferred that most of the excess ozone concentrations observed within the domain result from anthropogenic emissions within the domain and they are controllable by measures within the OTAG domain.",3.2,Physical and Chemical Processes,0,0

A residence time criterion serves to distinguish between short- (<1-2 days) and long-lasting exchange events. The adopted approach enables identification of a range of novel aspects of extratropical cross-tropopause transport which are of primary importance when assessing its chemical impact. For the considered year the annual cycle of the hemispherically integrated net cross-tropopause mass flux compares well with estimates from previous studies. The part of STE and TSE which occurs with equal amplitude in both directions (referred to as ""symmetric two-way exchange') has only a weak annual cycle and, for short residence times, a larger amplitude than the net exchange. The meridional distribution of the net flux reveals an upward branch in the subtropics, pronounced downward exchange in the midlatitudes and weak upward fluxes in the Arctic region. Detailed geographical distributions show significant zonal asymmetries with maximum exchange in the Atlantic and Pacific storm track regions. It is further shown that STE (TSE) events occur typically below (slightly above) the climatological tropopause position. Deep exchange (that is, rapid vertical transport between the stratosphere and the lower troposphere) is strongest during winter and confined to the midlatitude regions of baroclinic wave activity.

OBJECTIVE: To examine simultaneous effects of ozone and PM2.5 at levels below EPA standards on daily respiratory symptoms and rescue medication use among children with asthma. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Daily respiratory symptoms and medication use were examined prospectively for 271 children younger than 12 years with physician-diagnosed, active asthma residing in southern New England. Exposure to ambient concentrations of ozone and PM2.5 from April 1 through September 30, 2001, was assessed using ozone (peak 1-hour and 8-hour) and 24-hour PM2.5. Logistic regression analyses using generalized estimating equations were performed separately for maintenance medication users (n = 130) and nonusers (n = 141). Associations between pollutants (adjusted for temperature, controlling for same- and previous-day levels) and respiratory symptoms and use of rescue medication were evaluated. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Respiratory symptoms and rescue medication use recorded on calendars by subjects' mothers. RESULTS: Mean (SD) levels were 59 (19) ppb (1-hour average) and 51 (16) ppb (8-hour average) for ozone and 13 (8) microg/m3 for PM2.5. In copollutant models, ozone level but not PM2.5 was significantly associated with respiratory symptoms and rescue medication use among children using maintenance medication; a 50-ppb increase in 1-hour ozone was associated with increased likelihood of wheeze (by 35%) and chest tightness (by 47%). The highest levels of ozone (1-hour or 8-hour averages) were associated with increased shortness of breath and rescue medication use.

Average diurnal variations of about 32% of the mean were observed over the tropical Indian Ocean. We simulated these observations with the Model of Chemistry in Clouds and Aerosols, a photochemical box model with detailed aerosol chemistry. The model was constrained with photolysis rates, humidity, aerosol concentrations, NO, CO, and O-3 specified by shipboard observations and ozonesondes. Conventional homogeneous chemistry, where ozone photolysis to O(D-1) and HOx chemistry dominate ozone destruction, can account for a diurnal variation of only about 12%. On wet sea-salt aerosols (at humidities above the deliquescence point), absorption of HOBr leads to release of BrCl and Br-2, which photolyze to produce Br atoms that may provide an additional photochemical ozone sink. After 8 days of simulation, these Br atoms reach a peak concentration of 1.2 x 10(7) cm(-3) at noon and destroy ozone through a catalytic cycle involving BrO and HOBr. Reactive Br lost to HBr can be absorbed into the aerosol phase and reactivated. The model predicts a diurnal variation in O-3 of 22% with aerosol-derived Br reaction explaining much, but not all, of the observed photochemical loss.

In contrast, the combined cyclic inhalation of ozone and HDMA by HDMA sensitized infants monkeys resulted in a marked increase in serum IgE, serum histamine, and airways eosinophilia. Furthermore, combined cyclic inhalation of ozone and HDMA resulted in even greater alterations in airway structure and content that were associated with a significant elevation in baseline airways resistance and reactivity. These results suggest that ozone can amplify the allergic and structural remodeling effects of HDMA sensitization and inhalation.",5.4.2.4,Lifestage,0,0

We report the detection of an unidentified absorber in the 279 to 289 nm spectral region, which is used by many commercial DOAS systems for the measurement of atmospheric ozone on short absorption paths. Tests were performed to ensure that this absorber is not an artifact of the analysis procedure. The presence of the unidentified absorber can have serious consequences on ozone concentrations obtained with the DOAS technique when primary pollutant concentrations are high, while it is hardly noticeable under clean conditions. It is argued that either the absorber may be specific to New Zealand emissions, possibly due to the wide spreaduse of wood fires for domestic heating, or that its influence is generally overlooked because interest in ambient ozone usually concentrates on summer smog conditions, where primary pollutant concentrations are generally lower than during winter.

Regardless of the method chosen, the results demonstrate that pollutants such as O3 and PM2.5 have the potential to affect regions having spatial scales of several hundred kilometers.

The ability of MM5 to simulate the key temporal and spatial features embedded in the time series of observations of temperature, wind speed, and moisture is assessed using spectral decomposition methods. Also, mixing heights estimated from the MM5 outputs are compared with those derived from observations at a few locations where data with high temporal resolution are available in the Northeast. In addition, the uncertainties associated with the estimation of the evolution of the boundary layer during the morning time are examined. The results indicate that nighttime mixing heights averaged <200 m, rising to 1 km by 10 EST, and to about 2.5 km in the afternoon. Ventilation coefficients followed a similar diurnal pattern, increasing from 500 m2/s at night to 15,000 m2/s in the afternoon; the increase due to the growing mixing height and increasing surface wind speeds. Spatial variability of these parameters was relatively small (coefficient of variation = 0.25) at night and in the afternoon when conditions were quasi-stationary, but increased (to 0.5) during morning and evening hours when mixing heights and wind speeds were changing rapidly. Analyses of surface ozone observations from about 400 sites throughout the eastern United States indicate that days with numerous stations reporting surface ozone concentrations in excess of 80 ppb (i.e., ""high ozone"" days) generally had less daytime cloud cover, lower surface wind speeds, higher mixing heights, and lower ventilation coefficients than did comparable ""low ozone"" days. Such meteorological features are consistent with a synoptic anticyclone centered over the mid-south region (Kentucky, Tennessee). Low ozone days were characterized by more disturbed weather conditions (low pressure systems, fronts, greater cloud cover, and precipitation events). Ozone observations at two elevated platforms (~400 m agl) in Garner, NC, and Chicago, IL, indicated that ozone concentrations aloft were about 40% larger on ""high ozone"" days than on ""low ozone"" days. On average, high levels of ozone persist aloft for about 2 to 3 days. Strong vertical mixing in the daytime can bring this pool of upper-level ozone downward to augment surface ozone production. Since ozone can be transported downwind several hundred kilometers from its source region over this time scale, depending on upper-level winds, effective ozone control strategies must take into consideration spatial scales ranging from local to regional, and time scales of the order of several days.",3.2,Physical and Chemical Processes,0,0

Recent studies demonstrated that interfacial phospholipid films appreciably inhibited NO2 absorption. Because surface active phospholipids are present on alveolar and airway interfaces, we investigated the effects of interfacial films on O3 reactive absorption and acute cell injury. Compressed films of dipalmitoyl-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DPPC) and rat lung lavage lipids significantly reduced O3 reactive absorption by ascorbic acid (AH2), reduced glutathione, and uric acid. Conversely, unsaturated PC films did not inhibit O3 absorption. We evaluated O3-ediated cell injury using a human lung fibroblast cell culture system, an intermittent tilting exposure regimen to produce a thin covering layer, and nuclear fluorochrome permeability. Exposure produced negligible injury in cells covered with MEM. However, addition of AH2 produced appreciable (> 50%) cell injury. Film spreading of DPPC monolayers necessitated the use of untilted regimens. Induction of acute cell injury in untilted cultures required both AH2 plus very high O3 concentrations. Addition of DPPC films significantly reduced cell injury. We conclude that acute cell injury likely results from O3 reaction with ELF substrates. Furthermore, interfacial films of surface active, saturated phospholipids reduce the local dose of O3-derived reaction products. Finally, since O3 local dose and tissue damage likely correlate, we propose interfacial phospholipids may modulate intrapulmonary distribution of inhaled O3 and the extent of site-specific cell injury.",5.2.3,Ozone Reactions and Reaction Products,0,0

The specific goal of this study was to demonstrate an approach for using physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) modeling to compare inhalation dosimetry in the adult and the child of both males and females. Three categories of gases were considered: rapidly and irreversibly reactive in the respiratory tract (ozone), relatively water-soluble and nonreactive (isopropanol), and relatively water-insoluble and nonreactive (styrene, vinyl chloride, and perchloroethylene). The nonreactive chemicals were also selected because they are metabolized in the respiratory tract. The age-related changes observed for the estimated dose metrics were a function of the physiochemical properties of the inhaled vapor and their interactions in the body. Blood concentrations estimated for all vapors, either poorly metabolized (e.g., PERC), moderately metabolized (e.g., ST), or highly metabolized vapors (e.g., IPA and VC), varied less than a factor of two between infants and adults. These changes, moreover, were confined to the first year after birth, a relatively short window compared to the total lifespan of the individual. In contrast, circulating metabolite concentrations estimated in the blood, as well as amounts metabolized in the liver and lung, appeared to be a strong function of age, due to their dependence on the maturity of the pertinent metabolic enzyme systems.",5.2.2.6,Interindividual Variability in Dose,0,0

The aim of this study was to test in inbred strains of mice whether the lung susceptibility to O3 correlates with the transepithelial leakage of CC16, with the mRNA and protein levels of CC16, and possibly with specific isoforms of the protein in the respiratory tract. Five strains of mouse with increasing sensitivity to O3 (C3H, AKR, SJL, CBA, and C57Bl) were exposed to 1.8 ppm O3 for 3 h and examined at 0 and 6 h postexposure. The most sensitive (C57Bl) and resistant (C3H) mice were also continuously exposed to 0.11 ppm O3 for up to 3 days. Lung injury was evaluated by measuring in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) the levels of total protein, albumin, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and inflammatory cells. The patterns of proteins in BALF were also analyzed by two-dimensional electrophoresis (2-DE). Exposure to 1.8 or 0.11 ppm O3 caused a transient elevation of CC16 in serum that was maximal immediately after exposure and closely correlated with the extent of lung injury evaluated by BALF markers. The epithelial damage assessed on the basis of serum CC16 or BALF markers showed an inverse relation with the preexposure levels of CC16 in BALF. Since preexposure levels of CC16 mRNA were similar between the strains and since lung epithelium damage was also negatively correlated with preexposure levels of albumin in BALF, these findings identify basal lung epithelium permeability as a determinant of susceptibility to O3. The 2-DE mapping of proteins in BALF of these two strains revealed the existence of two distinct isoforms of CC16 with pI values of 4.9 and 5.2. The most acidic form was significantly less concentrated in the C57Bl strain, the most sensitive to O3, a difference that might be related to the higher permeability of the lung epithelium or to some post-transcriptional variations. In conclusion, these results suggest that the permeability of the lung epithelial barrier may be an important determinant of the lung susceptibility to O3, controlling the intrapulmonary levels of CC16 and possibly of other antioxidant/inflammatory proteins.",5.4.2.1,Gene environment Interactions ,0,0

Thirty-six children from two Nashville area communities (Inglewood and Hendersonville) participated in the O3 sampling program, and 99 children provided additional timeactivity information by telephone interview. By design, this study coincided with the 1994 Nashville/Middle Tennessee Ozone Study conducted by the Southern Oxidants Study, which provided enhanced continuous ambient O3 monitoring across the Nashville area. Passive sampling estimated weekly average outdoor O3 concentrations from 0.011 to 0.030 ppm in the urban Inglewood community and from 0.015 to 0.042 ppm in suburban Hendersonville. The maximum 1- and 8-hr ambient concentrations encountered at the Hendersonville continuous monitor exceeded the levels of the 1- and 8-hr metrics for the O3 National Ambient Air Quality Standard. Weekly average personal O3 exposures ranged from 0.0013 to 0.0064 ppm (7-31% of outdoor levels). Personal O3 exposures reflected the proportional amount of time spent in indoor and outdoor environments. Air-conditioned homes displayed very low indoor O3 concentrations, and homes using open windows and fans for ventilation displayed much higher concentrations.
Implications: This study demonstrates the usefulness of passive O3 sampling technology in measuring long-term outdoor/indoor/personal exposures. The test subjects did well in following simple directions concerning accurate exposure assessment and in keeping time-activity diaries. Personal O3 exposure, in between the extremes of higher outdoor and lower indoor exposures, is a function of time spent outdoors. Clearly, those children spending more time outdoors are subject to higher O3 exposures than are their more housebound peers. Continuous State and Local Air Monitoring System O3 monitoring results substantially overestimate weeklong indoor and personal O3 exposure.

Methods--In this prospective study, we recruited 1759 children (average age, 10 years) from schools in 12 southern California communities and measured lung function annually for eight years. The rate of attrition was approximately 10 percent per year. The communities represented a wide range of ambient exposures to ozone, acid vapor, nitrogen dioxide, and particulate matter. Linear regression was used to examine the relationship of air pollution to the forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) and other spirometric measures. Results--Over the eight-year period, deficits in the growth of FEV1 were associated with exposure to nitrogen dioxide (P=0.005), acid vapor (P=0.004), particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter of less than 2.5 Am (PM2.5) (P=0.04), and elemental carbon (P=0.007), even after adjustment for several potential confounders and effect modifiers.

The second hypothesis was that differences in breathing pattern and lung anatomy induce differences in ozone uptake. Sixty healthy nonsmokers participated in three exposure protocols during which their minute ventilation was 30 L/min, corresponding to moderate exercise. For the intermittent bolus exposure to ozone (BO3*), we measured the penetration volume at which 50% of the bolus was taken up (VP50%). Before and after continuous clean air exposure (Ca) and continuous ozone exposure (CO3: 0.25 ppm ozone), we measured forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1), calculated as the percent change after exposure relative to start of exposure [%FEV1]). We also measured the cross-sectional area of the peripheral lung (Ap) for carbon dioxide (CO2) diffusion, calculated as the percent change after exposure relative to start of exposure (%Ap). After the CO3 session, we also measured ozone uptake (as ozone uptake rate) and fractional ozone uptake efficiency. Uptake efficiency ranged from 0.70 to 0.98 among all subjects. It was inversely correlated with breathing frequency (P = 0.000) but was not correlated with conducting airways volume (P = 0.333). VP50% ranged from 67 to 135 mL among all subjects and was directly correlated with conducting airways volume (P = 0.000). These results indicate that overall ozone uptake was related to breathing frequency but not to airway size, whereas internal distribution of ozone shifted distally as airway size increased. Values of %FEV1 (mean +/- SD: -13.71 +/- 12.99) and %Ap (-7.80 +/- 9.34) were both significantly more negative (P = 0.000) in the CO3 session than in the Ca (control) session (-0.055 +/- 4.57 and 0.40 +/- 11.03, respectively). Ozone uptake rate correlated with individual %Ap (P = 0.008) but not with individual %FEV1 (P = 0.575). Nor were individual %Ap or %FEV1 correlated with VP50%.

Photochemical model calculations capture 66% of the variance of observed HOx concentrations. Two master variables are found to determine the variance of the 24 h average HOx concentrations: the primary HOx production rate, P(HOx), and the concentration of nitrogen oxide radicals (NOx=NO+NO2). We use these two variables as a coordinate system to diagnose the photochemistry of the upper troposphere and map the different chemical regimes. Primary HOx production is dominated by the O(1D)+H2O reaction when [H2O]>100 ppmv, and by photolysis of acetone (and possibly other convected HOx precursors) under drier conditions. For the principally northern midlatitude conditions sampled by the aircraft missions, the HOx yield from acetone photolysis ranges from 2 to 3. Methane oxidation amplifies the primary HOx source by a factor of 1.1-1.9.

The number of ozone molecules produced per HOy molecule consumed ranges from 4 to 12, such that ozone production rates vary between 0.3 and 5 ppbv d-1 in the upper troposphere. Three chemical regimes (NOx-limited, transition, NOx-saturated) are identified to describe the dependence of HOx concentrations and ozone production rates on the two master variables P(HOx) and [NOx]. Simplified analytical expressions are derived to express these dependences as power laws for each regime. By applying an eigenlifetime analysis to the HOx-NOx-O3 chemical system, we find that the decay of a perturbation to HOy in the upper troposphere (as from deep convection) is represented by four dominant modes with the longest time scale being factors of 2-3 times longer than the steady-state lifetime of HOy.",3.2.4,Temperature and Chemical Precursor Relationships,0,0

A biological basis for these responses has been provided by findings from animal and human laboratory-based studies, where transient decrements in lung function, increased hyperreactivity, and airway inflammation have all been demonstrated after exposure to environmentally relevant concentrations of ozone. Although the database for ozone-induced health effects is considerable, a number of issues remain unresolved. The relationship between inhaled ozone dose and the magnitude of the resultant pulmonary response has been limited to a consideration of transient lung function decrements, as these measurements are noninvasive and easy to perform. Similar analyses addressing the relationship between ozone dose and acute pulmonary inflammation and tissue injury have not been performed. Here, the available database is more limited, and issues related to variation in study design, airway sampling, and the endpoints studied have made a similar approach more problematic. Establishing these relationships is vital in determining threshold doses of ozone below which adverse responses are negligible in the healthy population. As the magnitude of lung function decrements is not simplistically related to epithelial injury or inflammation, one cannot rely on estimates derived from these modeling studies to determine threshold values for these other biologically important endpoints. 
Here, we describe the first attempt to model the ozone doseuinflammatory response based on a metaanalysis of data from published human chamber studies, where airway responses were assessed using bronchoscopy-based lavage. Analyses of inflammatory responses were based on the percentage of neutrophils recovered by bronchoscopy-based lavage in response to a set ozone dose, expressed as a function of concentration (mg/m3), VE (L/minute/m2 body surface area), and exposure time (minutes) - CVT (mg/m2 body surface area). Analysis of altered permeability responses was more complex and relied on the fold increase in lavage total protein between the ozone and air exposures. This metaanalysis included data from 21 publications containing 23 exposures, with responses stratified into those measured early (0-6 hours) or late (18-24 hours) postexposure. 
We observed evidence of a relatively simple linear relationship between ozone dose (CVT) and neutrophilia in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid samples (r2 = 0.44, p < 0.01 at 0-6 hours, and r2 = 0.51, p < 0.01 at 18-24 hours), with the regressions cutting the upper 95% confidence interval of the control neutrophil level (postair) at CVT values of 645 (408-883) mg/m2, intercept with 95% confidence intervals at 0 to 6 hours, and 810 (491-1,130) mg/m2 at 18 to 24 hours. Simple linear relationships were also observed between ozone dose and protein leak into the airways over the early- and late-acute response time points. Together, these data highlight an underlying association between ozone dose and airway responses and indicate that an appropriately designed large-scale exposure study could investigate the question of an ozone threshold level for such endpoints. Some of the results of these studies have been reported previously in the form of an abstract.",6.2.1.1,Controlled Human Exposure,0,0

In the present study, we investigated the effect of inhalation of O(3) on levels of F(2)-isoprostanes in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) and on levels of antioxidants in the BALF and plasma of hamsters. Because antioxidants, including urate, ascorbate, GSH, and vitamin E, defend the lungs by reacting with oxidizing agents, we expected to find a decrease in antioxidant levels after O(3) exposure. Similarly, we expected an increase in the levels of F(2)-isoprostanes, which are lipid peroxidation products. Exposure to 1.0 or 3.0 parts/million (ppm) O(3) for 6 h resulted in an increase in BALF neutrophil numbers, an indicator of acute inflammation, as well as elevation of BALF F(2)-isoprostanes. The higher dose of O(3) caused an increase in the BALF level of urate and a decrease in the plasma level of ascorbate, but 1.0 ppm O(3) had no effect on BALF or plasma antioxidant levels. Exposure to 0.12 ppm O(3) had no effect on BALF neutrophils or F(2)-isoprostanes nor on BALF and plasma antioxidants. We also investigated the effect of O(3) exposure of hamsters during exercise on F(2)-isoprostane and antioxidant levels. We found that exposure to 1.0 ppm O(3) during 1 h of exercise on a laddermill increased BALF levels of F(2)-isoprostanes but had no effect on BALF neutrophils or on BALF and plasma antioxidants.

Twenty-one healthy and 15 asthmatic subjects participated in the study. One hour after the two exposures to 250 ppb ozone we observed a mean increase in sputum neutrophils of 17.9 and 17.9% in healthy and of 20.3 and 15.2% in asthmatic subjects (p < 0.05 each). Twenty-four hours after exposure, the respective values were 11.9 and 14.8%, and 9.1 and 16.1% (p < 0.05 each).

Secondary motions were observed at all flow rates, their form depending upon direction of flow. Depending upon the curvature of the junction, flow separation with sluggish reversed flow could be observed in daughter tubes during inspiration. Inspiratory flow velocity profiles are highly asymmetric. In the plane of the junction, peak velocities swing to the inner walls. During expiration velocity profiles normal to the junction plane become flat while profiles in the plane develop an axial peak.

We conducted a panel study in 43 mail carriers by measuring their peak expiratory flow rates (PEFRs) twice daily for 6 weeks in 2001. The daily exposure of each mail carrier to O3, particulate matter < 10 microm in aerodynamic diameter (PM10), and nitrogen dioxide was estimated by one air monitoring station in the center of the mail carrier's delivery area. Hourly concentrations of air pollutants during their exposure periods were 6-96 ppb for O3, 11-249 microg/m3 for PM10, and 14-92 ppb for NO2. Linear mixed-effects models were used to estimate the association between air pollution exposures and PEFR after adjusting for subject's sex, age, and disease status and for temperature and humidity. We found that night PEFR and the deviation in night PEFR were significantly decreased in association with 8-hr O3 exposures with a lag 0-2 days and by daily maximum O3 exposures with a lag of 0-1 day in our multipollutant models. By contrast, neither PM10 nor NO2 was associated with a PEFR reduction. Daily 8-hr mean concentrations of O3 had greater reduction effects on PEFR than did daily maximum concentrations. For a 10-ppb increase in the 8-hr average O3 concentration, the night PEFR was decreased by 0.54% for a 0-day lag, 0.69% for a 1-day lag, and 0.52% for a 2-day lag.

Exposures consisted of seven 50-min periods of light exercise (V-E = 14.2 and 15.3 l/min/m(2) for ASTH and NONA, respectively), each followed by 10 min rest. A 35-min lunch period followed the third exercise.

ASTH who had the larger Os-induced decrements had lower baseline FEV(1)/FVC and lower baseline %predicted FEV(1).

Although the subgroups of the population that are most susceptible to O3 have not been identified, recent work in our laboratory suggested that methacholine responsiveness might be an important determinant of susceptibility to O3. PATIENTS AND METHODS: To test the hypothesis that methacholine responsiveness is correlated with FEV1 response after O3 exposure, we conducted methacholine challenge tests and O3 (0.20 ppm) and filtered air exposures for 4 h with moderate exercise on 66 healthy individuals. RESULTS: Repeated measures analysis of variance demonstrated significant changes in FEV1 (-0.82 +/- 0.63 L), FVC (-0.69 +/- 0.48 L), and specific airway resistance (SRaw) (+1.5 +/- 1.1 L x cm H2O/L/s) across the O3 exposure that persisted after adjusting for responses to air. Baseline PC100 (the concentration of methacholine that caused a doubling of the baseline SRaw) was weakly associated with O3-induced increases in SRaw (F1.54 = 2.85, p = 0.09), but not O3-induced declines in FEV1 or FVC. There was a weak association (r = -0.29) between O3- induced responses for SRaw and FEV1. The FEV1 responses for O3 were weakly associated with the symptoms of cough (r = -0.37), wheeze (r = - 0.29), chest pain on deep inspiration (r = -0.31), and shortness of breath (r = -0.37), but not with chest discomfort or sputum production. CONCLUSIONS: Although we were unable to find support for our hypothesis, we found, somewhat surprisingly, that respiratory symptoms were weakly associated or unassociated with FEV1 responses after O3 exposure. This finding implies that individuals may experience adverse effects, ie, respiratory symptoms, without large declines in lung function. Conversely, individuals may suffer large declines in lung function without prominent symptoms and, therefore, may remain in an unhealthy environment despite evidence of toxicity.",6.2.1.1,Controlled Human Exposure,3.1.4.1.1,Controlled Human Exposure Studies

Design: A prospective, crossover study of five atopic asthmatic and five normal subjects randomly exposed to ozone and filtered purified air (FPA) for 6 h, consisting of 30-min alternating periods of rest and moderate exercise. The two exposures were separated by at least 30 days. 

Setting: A controlled exposure in a stainless steel chamber. 

Patients: Five atopic asthmatic and five normal subjects between 18 and 45 years of age. Treatment with medications was withheld from asthmatics prior to the exposures. All subjects were nonsmokers. 

Interventions: Symptoms were assessed throughout the exposures. Pulmonary function was measured at baseline, hourly throughout an exposure, and after an exposure. Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) was performed 18 h after the completion of an exposure. The BAL fluid (BALF) was analyzed for cell count and differential; the cell-free supernatant was analyzed for albumin, tumor necrosis factor (TNF), interleukin 1 (IL-1), interleukin 6 (IL-6), and interleukin 8 (IL-8). 

Results: There were statistically significant increases in IL-8 levels, as well as percent polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMNs) and PMNs per milliliter of lavage in asthmatics exposed to ozone as compared with the same asthmatics exposed to FPA and the same normal subjects exposed to ozone and FPA. Interleukin 6 was also significantly increased in asthmatics exposed to ozone. The BALF albumin, TNF, and IL-1 levels were not significantly different among the four groups. There were no differences between asthmatics and healthy controls exposed to ozone or FPA in baseline to postexposure FEV1 FVC, FEV1/FVC, and sRaw. 

Conclusions: We conclude that asthmatics exposed to ozone develop a significant BALF neutrophilia and increased levels of the cytokines, IL-8 and IL-6. These BALF findings occur even though the level of ozone exposure was not significant enough to reduce pulmonary function.

75987,7835752,WOS:A1994PK69900009,,Mechanisms of radical formation from reactions of ozone with target molecules in the lung,"Pryor, WA",1994,"Ozone is known to cause radicals to be formed in biological systems: for example, it initiates lipid peroxidation and vitamin E protects in vitro model systems, cells, and animals against the effects of ozone. Ozone is not itself a radical, and we have asked: With what molecules does ozone react in the lung and how are radicals produced? Ozone reacts by two quite different mechanisms to produce radicals; one involves an ozone-olefin reaction and the other a reaction with electron donors such as glutathione (GSH). The first mechanism splits an R radical out of an olefin with the structure R-CH = CH2. The R then reacts with dioxygen to become a peroxyl radical (ROO), and both carbon- and oxygen-centered radicals can be detected by the electron spin resonance spin trap method. From the effects of temperature, metal chelators, and water, it is concluded that ozone reacts by the Criegee ozonation pathway to give the classical 1,2,3-trioxolane, which then undergoes O--O bond homolysis to form a diradical. This diradical then either undergoes beta-scission to split out the R radical or forms the more usual carbonyl oxide and a carbonyl compound. (See Figure 3 in the text). The low yield of Criegee ozonide that is generally obtained probably is due in part to the reactions forming radicals from the 1,2,3-trioxolane that compete with production of the Criegee ozonide. The second mechanism for radical production involves the reaction of ozone with electron donors. If the electron donor is, for example, GSH or its ion (GS-), this reaction produces the thiyl radical GS. and 0.3-. The ozone radical anion then reacts with a proton to form the hydroxyl radical and dioxygen: O3.- + H+--&gt;HO. and O2. Using 5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline-N-oxide, the spin adduct of the hydroxyl radical is detected. Similar reactions are observed with catechol.",5.2.3,Ozone Reactions and Reaction Products,0,0

Forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1.0) and forced expiratory flow rate between 25% and 75% of vital capacity (FEF25-75%) were calculated from FVC. Residual volume (RV) was calculated from FRC.

There were no significant differences among responses to the three O3 exposures. The decrements in measured pulmonary functions were smaller than typically observed in young males exposed to similar inhaled doses of O3. The data suggest possible saturation of the pulmonary response mechanism at a low degree of functional impairment in older men.

In this study, the effect of exposure to 0.4 ppm ozone on nasal inflammation in 11 allergic asthmatics sensitive to Dermatophygoides farinae was examined. This study was designed such that the effect of ozone exposure on the late-phase reaction to allergen was emphasized, using eosinophil influx and changes in eosinophil cationic protein as principal endpoints. By employing a ""split-nose"" design, in which allergen was applied to only one side of the nose while saline was applied to the contralateral side, both the effect of ozone on nasal inflammation due to allergen challenge as well as its direct action on non-allergen-challenged nasal tissues was examined.

Model studies using human red blood cell membranes,"Uppu, RM; Cueto, R; Squadrito, GL; Pryor, WA",1995,"#We exposed human red blood cell (RBC) membranes to low levels of ozone and measured the oxidative damage that occurs to the proteins and the unsaturated lipids that are present. Oxidative damage to proteins causes significant decreases in the content of thiol groups, the fluorescence of protein-tryptophan residues, and the activity of membrane-bound acetylcholinesterase. Oxidative damage to lipids causes changes in some of the unsaturated fatty acids (UFA) in the lipid fraction of these RBC membranes. Significant amounts of hexanal, heptanal, and nonanal are formed from the ozonation of UFA. Although no decrease in the amount of oleate is detected, it does undergo ozonation to yield nonanal; thus, as would be expected, product appearance is a more sensitive measure of ozonation than is substrate disappearance. These results imply that both proteins and unsaturated lipids undergo simultaneous and competitive ozonation in human RBC membranes when ozone is the limiting reactant. The ratios of reaction of ozone with different targets can be predicted in reasonably good agreement with the observed values using calculations (W. A. Pryer and R. M. Uppu (1993) J. Biol.

Reactions near the ELF gas/liquid interface likely provide the driving force for O3 absorption (""reactive absorption"") and constrain O3 diffusion to the underlying epithelium. To investigate the potential mechanisms wherein O3/ELF interactions may induce cellular damage, we utilized a red cell membrane (RCM) model intermittently covered by an aqueous film to mimic the lung surface compartmentation, and evaluated exposure-mediated loss of acetylcholinesterase activity (AChE) and TBARS accumulation. In the absence of aqueous reactants, O3 exposure induced no detectable changes in AChE or TBARS. AH2 and GSH preferentially induced oxidative damage in a dose-dependent fashion. AH2-mediated RCM oxidation was not inhibited by superoxide dismutase, catalase, mannitol, or Fe chelators. O3 reaction with UA, Trolox, or albumin produced no RCM oxidation but oxidation occurred when AH2 was combined with UA or albumin. Rat bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) also induced RCM oxidation. However, in vivo O3 exposure dampened the extent of BALF-mediated RCM oxidation. Although we cannot completely rule out O3 diffusion to the RCM, product(s) derived from O3 + AH2/GSH reactions (possibly O3*- or 1O2) likely initiated RCM oxidation and may suggest that in vivo, such secondary species account for O3 permeation through the ELF leading to cellular perturbations.",5.2.3,Ozone Reactions and Reaction Products,0,0

Because of the chemical reactivity of ozone, it likely reacts with target molecules in pulmonary surfactant, a lipid-rich material that lines the epithelial cells in the airways. Phospholipids containing unsaturated fatty acyl groups and cholesterol would be susceptible to attack by ozone, which may lead to the formation of cytotoxic products. Whereas free radicalderived oxidized cholesterol products have been frequently studied for their cytotoxic effects, ozonized cholesterol products have not been studied, although they could reasonably play a role in the toxicity of ozone. The reaction of ozone with cholesterol yielded a complex series of products including 3beta-hydroxy-5-oxo-5,6-secocholestan-6-al, 5-hydroperoxy-B-homo-6-oxa-cholestan-3beta,7a-diol, and 5beta,6beta-epoxycholesterol. Mass spectrometry and radioactive monitoring were used to identify the major cholesterol-derived product during the reaction of 2 ppm ozone in surfactant as 5beta,6beta-epoxycholesterol, which is only a minor product during ozonolysis of cholesterol in solution. A dose-dependent formation of 5beta,6beta-epoxycholesterol was also seen during direct exposure of intact cultured human bronchial epithelial cells (16-HBE) to ozone. Studies of the metabolism of this epoxide in lung epithelial cells yielded small amounts of the expected metabolite, cholestan-3beta,5alpha,6beta-triol, and more abundant levels of an unexpected metabolite, cholestan-6-oxo-3beta,5alpha-diol. Both 5beta,6beta-epoxycholesterol and cholestan-6-oxo-3beta,5alpha-diol were shown to be cytotoxic to cultured 16-HBE cells.

Aerosol penetration indexes, i.e., ratio of particle deposition in central lung regions to that in peripheral lung regions, and particle retention 24 h postinhalation (an index of aerosol deposition within alveoli and slowly clearing bronchioles) indicated that particle filtration efficiency had increased for tracheobronchial and parenchymal lung regions.

Spirometry was performed at the end, 25 min and 24 h after exposure, bronchoscopy at 24 h after exposure.

The percentage reduction in (isoV) FEF25-75 at 25 min and 24 h after administration of O3 correlated closely with the rise in fibrinogen concentrations in BALF, a marker of altered vascular permeability. Rp, a measurement dominated by very small or peripheral airways, was unaffected in 7 of 8 subjects. The absence of change in Rp might have reflected insufficient penetration of O3 into these airways to produce or sustain an effect for 24 h; alternatively, the bronchoscopic procedure which included atropine and lidocaine pretreatment may have reversed an O3 effect. An unexpected finding was the significant association between baseline Rp (after FA) and the magnitude of the spirometric response to O3.

Differences between the various modes are discussed. The fractions of fine and coarse particles collected in specific size ranges, such as total suspended particulate matter (TSP), PM10, PM2.5, and PM(10-2.5), are shown. Correlations of 24-h concentrations of PM2.5, PM10, and PM(10-2.5) at the same site show that, in Philadelphia and St. Louis, PM2.5 is highly correlated with PM10 but poorly correlated with PM (10-2.5). Among sites distributed across these urban areas, the site-to-site correlations of 24-h PM concentrations are high for PM2.5 but not for PM(10-2.5). This indicates that a PM measurement at a central monitor can serve as a better indicator of the community-wide concentration of fine particles than of coarse particles. The fraction of ambient outdoor particles found suspended indoors is greater for fine particles than for coarse particles because of the difference in indoor lifetimes. Consideration of these relationships leads to the hypothesis that the statistical associations found between daily PM indicators and health outcomes may be the result of variations in the fine particle component of the atmospheric aerosol, not of variations in the coarse component. As a result, epidemiologic studies using PM10 or TSP may provide more useful information on the acute health effects of fine particles than coarse particles. Fine and coarse particles are separate classes of pollutants and should be measured separately in research and epidemiologic studies.

We hypothesized that lung injury from continuous 1-week O3 exposure would also be increased under conditions of AH2  deficiency because of (1) a diminished antioxidant pool to counteract the oxidant challenge, (2) impaired reparation of tissue injury, and/or (3) altered antioxidant redox homeostasis. Female Hartley guinea pigs (260?330 g) were made AH2 deficient by providing a diet similar to guinea pig chow, but having no AH2. The dietary regimen was started 1 week prior to exposure and was continued during exposure to O3 (0, 0.2, 0.4, or 0.8 ppm, 23 hr/day, 7 days) as well as 1 week post-exposure. Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) and tissue AH2 were measured in subgroups at the beginning of exposure (1 week on the AH2-deflcient diet), at its termination and 1 week post-exposure. AH2 measured in ear tissue punches proved to be an easy and effective monitor for AH2 deficiency. One week on the AH2-deficient diet caused a 70?80% drop in ear, lung and liver AH2, while AH2 in BAL was decreased by 90%. Immediately after the exposure, total BAL protein and albumin (markers of lung permeability) were increased (?50%) at 0.8 ppm with no difference between the dietary groups. O3 caused an increase in total BAL cells and neutrophils in a concentration-dependent manner with only a slight augmentation due to diet. Exposure to O3 caused an increase in lung and BAL AH2 in normal guinea pigs. Glutathione and uric acid were also increased in the lung and BAL after O3 exposure (40?570%) in both dietary groups, and the levels remained elevated during the recovery period. Lung ?-tocopherol was not changed due to O3. A significant overall diet-related decrease was seen in AH2-deficient guinea pigs, immediately after the exposure and recovery.

Air pollution was found to be significantly and consistently correlated with acute asthma exacerbations, chest symptoms, and lung function decrements.

Effects were found to be roughly monotonic as a function of O3 concentration. Regression of morning (8:00 A.M.) to afternoon (5:00 P.M.) peak flow change on O3 indicated pulmonary function reductions similar to those previously reported for more active children without asthma.

Based on these relative risk estimates, a rise in the 1-h daily maximal O3 from 84 ppb to 160 ppb was associated in this group with an increase from 20 to 28 (+/- 2) in the expected number of unscheduled medications administered/day, and from 29 to 41 (+/- 3) in the expected total number of chest symptoms/day.

The buildings were naturally ventilated by opening the windows, or mechanically ventilated, and showed various air permeabilities. Ozone, nitrogen oxides (NO and NO2), and airborne particle (particle counts within 15 size intervals ranging from 0.3 to 15 m) concentrations were continuously monitored indoors and outdoors for two 2-week periods. The indoor humidity, temperature, CO2 concentration (an indicator of occupancy), window openings and building permeability were also measured. The temporal profiles of indoor and outdoor concentrations show ozone and nitrogen oxides behave differently: NO and NO2 indoor/outdoor concentration ratios (I/O) were found to vary in a range from 0.5 to 1, and from 0.88 to 1, respectively, but no correlation with building permeability was observed. On the contrary, I/O ratios of ozone vary in a range from 0 to 0.45 and seem to be strongly influenced by the building air-tightness: the more airtight the building envelope, the lower the ratio. Occupancy, through re-suspension of previously deposited particles and possible particle generation, strongly influences the indoor concentration level of airborne particles. However, this influence decreases with particle size, reflecting the way deposition velocities vary as a function of size. The influence of particle size on deposition and penetration across the building envelope is also discussed by analyzing the I/O ratios measured when the buildings were unoccupied, by comparing the indoor concentrations measured when the buildings were occupied and when they were not (O/U ratios), and by referring to previously published studies focussing on this topic. Except one case, I/O were found to vary in the range from 0.03 to 1.79. All O/U are greater than one and increase up to 100 with particle size.

The study presented here provides data on compared outdoor and indoor concentration levels in school buildings, as well as information on the parameters influencing the relationship between outdoor and indoor air quality.

Therefore, inhalation studies that are designed to examine the toxicity of coexposures to two or more airborne toxicants may be more relevant for assessing human health risks than those studies that investigate the toxic effects of only one airborne toxicant at a time. Furthermore, airborne biogenic substances such as pollens, bacteria, fungi, and microbial toxins often coexist with common air pollutants in the ambient air, and when inhaled may also cause specific adverse effects on the respiratory tract. One such biogenic substance, bacterial endotoxin, is a potent stimulus of airway inflammation and is commonly found in domestic, agricultural, and industrial settings. Little is known about the interaction of exposures to biogenic substances and common air pollutants, such as ozone or airborne particulate matter. In the last few years, we have performed a series of in vivo studies using laboratory rodents that examined how airway surface epithelial cells are altered by coexposure to ozone and a biogenic substance, either bacterial endotoxin or a commonly used experimental aeroallergen (ovalbumin). Results from these studies indicate that the ozone-induced epithelial and inflammatory responses in laboratory rodents may be markedly enhanced by coexposure to an inhaled biogenic substance. Conversely, the adverse airway alterations caused by exposure to biogenic substances may be enhanced by coexposure to ozone. The results from these initial studies have also suggested some of the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying the phenotypic epithelial alterations induced by these coexposures.

Ozone is a major constituent of air pollution in the summer. Epidemiological studies have demonstrated that there is an increase in hospital admissions for respiratory diseases 1 day after peak levels of ambient ozone. This may be due to an increase in the responsiveness of the airways to bronchoconstrictor stimuli. 2. In the present study we therefore studied the effect of a controlled exposure to ozone on the maximal degree of airway narrowing to a non-specific bronchoconstrictor, methacholine, 12 h after exposure. Both non-asthmatic and mild-asthmatic volunteers were exposed to ozone. 3. The study had a single blind design. Experimental exposures were to filtered air, 0.40 ppm ozone and filtered air respectively, at 1-week intervals. The duration of each exposure was 2 h with alternating periods of 15 min rest and exercise. At 12 h after exposure, methacholine inhalation challenge tests and sputum induction were performed. 4. Twelve hours after exposure to ozone there was a significant increase in the maximal degree of airway narrowing to methacholine (P < 0.02) compared with exposure to air, in non-asthmatic as well as asthmatic subjects. These physiological changes were accompanied by a significant rise in the percentage of neutrophils in induced sputum (P < 0.02). All changes had returned to baseline values 1 week after exposure to ozone. 5. Exposure to ozone causes a transient increase in the maximal degree of airway narrowing to methacholine in both non-asthmatic and asthmatic subjects. These laboratory results, obtained using relatively high ozone exposure in carefully selected subjects, might provide an explanation for the temporal relationship between ambient ozone levels and hospital admissions for asthma.",6.2.1.1,Controlled Human Exposure,0,0

The emissions of several polar volatile organic compounds(VOCs) including organic acids and carbonyls (aldehydes and ketones) were measured while a glass tube coated with latex paint was exposed to clean air and ozone. Four different commercial brands of latex paint were tested. Formic and acetic acids were not found to be generated via ozone reactions; however, both were found to off-gas from the latex paints, and the off-gasing increased with increasing relative humidity. The off-gasing rates are large enough, particularly for acetic acid, to impact residential concentrations significantly. Formaldehyde was found to be produced by reactions related to the ozone concentration. There was some evidence that acetaldehyde and acetone may also be produced by processes related to the ozone concentration. A steady-state model is presented that is used to extrapolate the chamber results to a representative indoor environment The model is based on an experimentally derived parameter termed the VOC formation factor, which is defined as the number of VOC molecules of a particular species formed via an ozone reaction divided by the total number of ozone molecules sticking to the surface.

Indoor carbonyl concentrations were similar between the summer and winter, with the total mean winter concentration being 31.7 ppb and the total mean summer concentration being 36.6 ppb. However, the average air exchange rate was 0.9 hr(-1) during the winter and 2.6 hr(-1) during the summer. Therefore, the estimated carbonyl emission rates were significantly higher during the summer. Indoor organic acid concentrations were about twice as high during the summer as during the winter. For formic acid, the indoor winter mean was 9.8 ppb, and the summer indoor mean was 17.8 ppb. For acetic acid, the indoor winter mean was 15.5 ppb, and the summer indoor mean was 28.7 ppb. The concentrations of the polar VOCs were found to be significantly correlated with one another.

The definition of this effect depends upon the study design, disease model parameterization, and the type of analysis. Further limitations are imposed by the nature of exposure and our ability to measure it. We define a plausible exposure model for air pollutants that are relatively nonreactive and discuss how exposure varies. We discuss plausible disease models and show how their parameterizations are affected by different exposure partitions and by different study designs. We then discuss a measurement model conditional on ambient concentrations and incorporate this into the disease model. We use simulation studies to show the impact of a range of exposure model assumptions on estimation of the health effect in the ecologic time series design. This design only uses information from the time-varying ambient source exposure. When ambient and nonambient sources are independent, exposure variation due to nonambient source exposures behaves like Berkson measurement error and does not bias the effect estimates. Variation in the population attenuation of ambient concentrations over time does bias the estimates with the bias being either positive or negative depending upon the association of this parameter with ambient pollution. It is not realistic to substitute measured average personal exposures into time series studies because so much of the variation in personal exposures comes from nonambient sources that do not contribute information in the time series design. We conclude that general statements about the implications of measurement error need to be conditioned on the health effect study design and the health effect parameter to be estimated.",4.6,Implications for Epidemiologic Studies,2.6,Interpreting Exposure Measurement Error for Use in Epidemiology Studies

The former studies, focusing on the pulmonary effects of O3 and associated pollutants on children under natural conditions of exposure, are potentially of great importance to understanding the public health impact of ambient O3. However, a thorough assessment of the results of these studies has been hampered by differences in the analysis and reporting of data across the various studies. We obtained data sets from six summer camp studies carried out by three separate investigative groups, including two New Jersey studies performed by New York University, two studies in Ontario carried out by Health and Welfare Canada, and two studies in southern California. The data consisted of sequential, daily measurements of forced expiratory volume in 1 sec (FEV1), peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR), and 1-hr O3 concentration in the hour preceding lung function measurements for each child. We analyzed the relationships between lung  function  and  O3  using  linear  regression models that fit subject-specific intercepts and a single, pooled O3 slope. These models were fit for each of the six studies separately and for all studies combined. All of the study-specific slopes of FEV1 on O3 were negative (i.e., increased O3 associated with decreased FEV1); five of six were statistically significant. Analysis of the combined six-study data set yielded a slope of -0.50 ml FEV1/ppb O3 (p<0.0001). Addition of time-trend variables to the combined-data analysis diminished, but did not eliminate, the FEV1-O3 relationship. Study-specific slopes for PEFR on O3 were more variable. Combined over studies, no significant relationship was observed between PEFR and O3. However, this negative finding appeared to be partially confounded by time trends in PEFR. The results of this reanalysis provide  strong evidence that children exposed to O3 under natural conditions experience decreases in FEV1 of the kind demonstrated in laboratory studies, and raise concern that other acute respiratory effects observed in those studies (e.g., pulmonary inflammation) may also occur in young people exposed to ambient O3.",6.2.1.2,Epidemiology,0,0

This work suggests that for estimating acute effects, ambient concentration measurements are quite adequate in time-series studies. In addition, time-series studies have ample power relative to panel studies, in spite of the ecologic nature of their design. Panel studies have the benefit of being able to use all the information from personal exposures in the analysis, but they are much more costly and difficult to conduct.

These changes have been reported for the ""initial"" (1- to 3-h) and ""late"" (18- to 20-h) postexposure periods. We hypothesized that at the late period when protein and cellular markers of inflammation in bronchoalveolar  lavage  remain abnormal, permeability of respiratory epithelia would be altered. To test this, we measured by gamma-camera imagery the clearance kinetics in healthy subjects (n = 9) of 99mTc-labeled solute [diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (DTPA)] that was deposited by aerosol onto epithelial surfaces 19 +/- 1 h after a single exposure to ozone (O3; 130 min at ambient levels between 150 and 350 parts per billion and alternate periods of rest and moderate exercise) or filtered air. At the late period, the lung clearance of 99mTc-DTPA over a 120-min period was significantly increased, i.e., 0.732%/min for O3 exposures compared with 0.661%/min for filtered-air exposures (P < 0.05). Regional analysis demonstrated that 99mTc-DTPA clearance from the periphery (excluding the lung hilum) and lung apexes were significantly increased by O3 but changes in clearance for the base of the lung were not significant. The forced expiratory volume in 1 s at the late time after O3 was slightly but significantly reduced (-2.1%) from preexposure levels. There was no relationship between the functional changes observed acutely after exposure to O3 and subsequent changes in 99mTc-DTPA clearance or forced expiratory volume in 1 s observed at the late period. These results suggest that epithelial permeability of the lung is altered 18-20 h post-O3; this injury is regional, and the lung base appears to have a different time course of response or is in an adapted state with respect to O3 exposure.",5.3.4,Alteration of Epithelial Barrier Function,0,0

The study focused on a 2-week episode, 11-24 July 1999, and employed the new integrated and mechanistically consistent source-to-dose modeling framework of MENTOR/SHEDS (Modeling Environment for Total Risk studies/Stochastic Human Exposure and Dose Simulation). The MENTOR/SHEDS application presented here consists of four components involved in estimating population exposure/dose: (1) calculation of ambient outdoor concentrations using emission-based photochemical modeling, (2) spatiotemporal interpolation for developing census-tract level outdoor concentration fields, (3) calculation of microenvironmental concentrations that match activity patterns of the individuals in the population of each census tract in the study area, and (4) population-based dosimetry modeling. It was found that the 50th percentiles of calculated microenvironmental concentrations of PM2.5 and O3 were significantly correlated with census-tract level outdoor concentrations, respectively. However, while the 95th percentiles of O3 microenvironmental concentrations were strongly correlated with outdoor concentrations, this was not the case for PM2.5. By further examining the modeled estimates of the 24-h aggregated PM2.5 and O3 doses, it was found that indoor PM2.5 sources dominated the contributions to the total PM2.5 doses for the upper 5 percentiles, Environmental Tobacco Smoking (ETS) being the most significant source while O3 doses due to time spent outdoors dominated the contributions to the total O3 doses for the upper 5 percentiles. The MENTOR/SHEDS system presented in this study is capable of estimating intake dose based on activity level and inhalation rate, thus completing the source-to-dose modeling sequence. The MENTOR/SHEDS system also utilizes a consistent basis of source characterization, exposure factors, and human activity patterns in conducting population exposure assessment of multiple co-occurring air pollutants, and this constitutes a primary distinction from previous studies of population exposure assessment, where different exposure factors and activity patterns would be used for different pollutants. Future work will focus on incorporating the effects of commuting patterns on population exposure/dose assessments as well as on extending the MENTOR/SHEDS applications to seasonal/annual studies and to other areas in the U.S.",4.5.3,Microenvironment-Based Models,2.3.2.5,Microenvironmental Modeling

Accumulating evidence indicates that the FEM is prone to bias under the hot, humid, and stagnant conditions conducive to high O3 formation. This bias may lead to overreporting hourly O3 concentrations by as much as 20-40 ppb.

Epithelial lining fluid obtained as bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid, was taken from 16 male subjects and the antioxidant concentrations determined for each subject. BAL fluid samples from nine of these subjects were then exposed, using an interfacial exposure system, to a range (50-1000 ppb) of ozone concentrations.

Considerable intersubject variation was however observed. The individual rates of consumption for each antioxidant were significantly correlated with the respective initial antioxidant concentration.

A dosimetry model was used to simulate the uptake of reactive gases in the respiratory tracts of rats and humans. The PAR dose was chosen because this region is the site of the most severe lesions in laboratory animals exposed to reactive gases, such as O-3 and NO2. PAR dose ratios can be used to establish exposure concentrations that yield the same PAR dose in different species, thereby facilitating extrapolation of animal toxicological results to humans. The influence of V-TB(FRC) and expansion was explored using different breathing frequencies, tidal volumes, and TB region mass transfer coefficients. For TB region expansion, results for uniform expansion of all lower respiratory tract airways and airspaces were compared to results obtained when the TB region did not expand. TB region expansion decreased both predicted fractional uptake and PAR dose, with the decreases being greater for the rat than the human. For example, reductions in predicted fractional uptake due to TB region expansion ranged from 7% to 43% for the rat, but were less than 8% in humans; PAR doses in the rat were reduced by 23% to 67% and in the human by 0.5% to 24%, but generally by less than 8%. The effect of uniform expansion relative to no expansion was to reduce the predicted PAR dose ratio by up to 67%. For the effect of V-TB(FRC), results for V-TB(FRC) that were two standard deviations (25D) less than or greater than mean V-TB(FRC) were compared to dosimetry predictions for the mean. Doses were predicted to be up to 57%, smaller and up to 197% larger than doses associated with the mean V-TB(FRC). Accounting for uncertainty in both rat and human V-TB(FRC), PAR dose ratios were predicted to be as small as 74% less than or as large as 307% more than the dose ratio estimated for the mean V-TB(FRC), depending on the expansion mode and other parameters. Our analyses yield the following general conclusions: (1) A better understanding and characterization of the role of TB region expansion (particularly for the rat) and volume is critically important for an improved understanding of respiratory-tract dosimetry of reactive gases and for decreasing uncertainties in inter- and intraspecies extrapolations of dose associated with toxicological effects. (2) Extrapolations based on dose at toxicologically relevant sites (the PAR in this investigation) can differ significantly from those based on exposure concentration or total uptake. (3) Human subjects who aear similar outwardly may have very different PAR doses and consequently potentially different responses to the same exposure.

In contrast, the asthmatic subjects showed significantly greater (p < 0.05) O3-induced increases in several inflammatory endpoints (percent neutrophils and total protein concentration) in BAL as compared with normal subjects who underwent bronchoscopy (n = 20). Our results indicate that asthmatic persons may be at risk of developing more severe O3-induced respiratory tract injury/inflammation than normal persons, and may help explain the increased asthma morbidity associated with O3 pollution episodes observed in epidemiologic studies.",5.4.2.2,Pre existing Diseases and Conditions,0,0

Because the National Ambient Air Quality Standard for ozone (O3) is intended to protect the most sensitive individuals in the general population, it is necessary to identify sources of intersubject variation in the exposure-dose-response cascade. We hypothesize that differences in lung anatomy can modulate exposure-dose relationships between individuals, and this results in differences between their responsiveness to O3 at a fixed exposure condition. During quiet breathing, the conducting airways remove the majority of inhaled O3, so the volume of this region should have an important impact on O3 dose distribution. Employing the bolus inhalation method, we measured the distribution of O3 absorption with respect to penetration volume (VP), and using the Fowler single-breath N2 washout method, we determined the dead space volume (VD) in the lungs of 10 men and 10 women at a fixed respiratory flow of 250 ml/s. On average, the women absorbed O3 at smaller VP than the men, and the women had smaller VD than the men. When expressed in terms of VP/ VD, the absorption distribution of the men and women was indistinguishable. Moreover, an interpretation of the O3 distribution in terms of an intrinsic mass transfer parameter (Ka) indicated that differences between the O3 dosimetry in all subjects, whether men or women, could be explained by a unique correlation with anatomic dead space: Ka (in s-1) = 610 VD-1.05 (in ml). Application of this result to measurements of O3 exposure response indicated that previously reported gender differences may be due to a failure in properly accounting for tissue surface within the conducting airways.",5.2.2,Ozone Uptake ,0,0

The magnitude of alveolar protein transudation induced by ozone was not different between age groups, but the interindividual variability of protein changes was higher in senescent (24-mo-old) rats. By comparison to juvenile (2-mo-old) and adult (9-mo-old) rats, senescent animals had higher increases of interleukin-6 (up to 10-fold higher) and N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase (NAGA; 2-fold higher) in lung lavage after ozone. Ascorbic acid was lower in lungs of senescent rats (one-half of juvenile values), and acute ozone exposure brought a further decrease in lung ascorbate. Whereas alveolar protein transudation was attenuated after ozone exposure on 4 days, persistent elevation of NAGA in senescent rats suggested only partial adaptation. Injection of endotoxin did not modify the patterns of effects. Incorporation of sup 1sup 8O-ozone into macrophages and surfactant was not different between age groups, indicating that the magnified biological responses in senescent rats were not dominated by differences in internal dose of ozone. The results indicate that senescent rats respond differently than juvenile and adult rats to lung injury.",5.2.3,Ozone Reactions and Reaction Products,0,0

To address this, we studied 12 asthmatic subjects aged 9 to 16 yr, who recorded daily asthma symptoms (functional levels 0 to 5) and as-needed inhaler use during September and October 1993 in San Diego, California. Outdoor aeroallergens, O-3, and fine particle concentrations were measured at a central outdoor site, and personal 12-h daytime exposures to O-3 were measured daily. Personal O-3 differed greatly between subjects and was 27% of mean outdoor O-3. In random-effects autoregressionmodels controlling for weekend days and fungal spores, personal O-3 was associated with asthma severity: for a 90th percentile increase in O-3 (25 ppb), symptom scores increased by 25% (95% CI: 0 to 49%) and inhaler use increased by 26% (95% CI: 3 to 48%) over their averages. Outdoor 12-h O-3, but not 1-h maximum O-3, was associated with inhaler use (p lt 0.03). Fungal spores were significantly associated with symptoms (scores increased by 0.1 to 0.3/1,000 spores/m-3) and inhaler use (0.1 to 0.4 puffs/1,000 spores/m-3)across speciated groups.

Glutathione was measured in well-defined subcompartments of the lung of both rats and monkeys to compare alterations occurring in both target(distal trachea and terminal bronchiole) and nontarget areas (lobarbronchus, major daughter, minor daughter bronchus, and parenchyma) of the lung in species that differ in sensitivity to ozone exposure (rat is less susceptible than monkey). Glutathione concentrations were decreased intrachea of rats exposed to 0.4 ppm ozone for 2 h and increased in lobar bronchus and distal bronchiole after 2 h exposure at 1 ppm. In monkey, glutathione levels in most subcompartments were not altered by either 0.4or 1.0 ppm ozone exposure for 2 h. The exceptions were the major daughter subcompartment (200% of control at 0.4 ppm exposure) and the distal bronchiole (55% of control at 1 ppm exposure). Ninety day ozone exposures(6 h/day times 5 days/week) in rats produced an elevation in glutathione (164% of control value) only in distal bronchiole at the 1 ppm exposure level. In a similar manner, glutathione levels in the distal bronchiole of monkeys exposed for 90 days to 1 ppm O-3 were 165% of the corresponding control values. These results suggest the following: glutathione levels in target and nontarget areas of the lung and insusceptible versus less susceptible species are not the primary determinant in the differences observed in ozone toxicity; the response of lung subcompartments to short-term ozone exposure varied depending on airway subcompartment and species; increased glutathione levels may be one reason for adaptation of some airway epithelial cells from rats and monkeys exposed to O-3 for long periods; and use of well-defined segments of the lung provides a means of assessing changes in target areas of the lung without dilution from nontarget areas.",5.5.1,Interspecies Dosimetry,0,0

Healthy men (n = 10) were evaluated over 3 consecutive days (130 min/day) of chamber exposure to O3 and filtered air (FA); subjects alternated between rest and light treadmill exercise during exposures. For O3, the level was varied at 20-min intervals, i.e., 250, 350, 450, 450, 350, and 250 parts/billion, and concluded with 10 min at 250 parts/billion. ST was quantitated by high-performance  liquid  chromatography  techniques, and T-lymphocyte blastogenesis was measured in cell cultures of peripheral blood monocytes by  comparing  [3H]thymidine  incorporation  in  mitogen-stimulated (concanavalin A) and nonstimulated cells. After the third day of O3 at 20 h postexposure, ST levels were reduced significantly compared with the FA control subjects (down 14%; -0.96 mumol/l). Mitogen-activated T lymphocytes exhibited a 61% increase in blastogenic activity after 3 days of O3 exposure, significant compared with the proliferative activity of activated T lymphocytes collected after FA or before O3. Acute airway function was impaired by O3, e.g., on day 1, the forced vital capacity and forced expiratory volume in 1 s were decreased 8% (-0.92 liter) and 14% (-0.86 l/s), respectively, from preexposure values, and full recovery was delayed beyond 24 h.

Rabbits were exposed for 7 h to either room temperature-humidified filtered air (n = 7) or 0.2 ppm O3 in humidified room air (n = 5). Tracheal PD was recorded 3 h after exposure. Whole lung resistance (RL) and reactivity were partitioned into their central (RC) and peripheral  (RP)  components using a retrograde catheter and forced oscillation. Changes in RL, RC, and RP in response to NaCl (0.9%) and ACh (100 mM) aerosol challenges were measured before and after vagotomy. Exposure to O3 decreased tracheal PD from -29 +/- 0.6 mV in air-exposed rabbits to -15 +/- 2 mV in O3-exposed rabbits (p < or = 0.0001). Exposure to O3 did not alter RL, RC, or RP. However, the ACh-induced increase in RL in O3-exposed rabbits (140%) was twice that recorded in the air-exposed group (p < or = 0.01). While changes in RP dominated the whole lung response to ACh in air-exposed rabbits, changes in RC were most prominent in the O3-exposed group. Bilateral vagotomy did not alter airway reactivity in control rabbits but did enhance peripheral lung reactivity in O3-exposed rabbits. We conclude that exposure to 0.2 ppm O3 for 7 h affects tracheal epithelial function in rabbits and increases central airway reactivity via vagal mechanisms without altering baseline RL, RC, or RP.",5.3.5,Sensitization of Bronchial Smooth Muscle,0,0

In the secretions lining the human nasal cavity uric acid has been shown to be the only low molecular weight antioxidant present in abundance. Because this uric acid originates in the plasma, it is possible that factors affecting the levels of plasma uric acid will also alter the levels recovered in lavage fluids. Lavage fluid from 15 men (20-68 years) and 11 women (20-59 years) were collected using a modified Foley catheter which allowed each subject to suly a basal lavage (saline removed immediately after instillation) and an 'accrued' lavage (saline left in situ for 5 min) from each nasal cavity. Lavage fluids were assayed for protein, lysozyme acid uric acid. The levels of protein and lysozyme in the recovered fluids were found not to be affected by subject age or gender. Uric acid, however, was found to have a weak negative (r(2) = -0.685 basal and -0.62 accrued) correlation with age in women, but no such correlation was noted in men. Also, the levels of uric acid in women (1.3 +/- 0.3 mu M/L basal and 4.5 +/- 0.6 mu M/L accrued) were found to be lower than those seen in men (3.1 +/- 0.6 mu M/L basal and 8.4 +/- 1.3 mu M/L accrued) (p = 0.0681 and 0.0394 respectively). It is concluded that women have lower levels of uric acid in lavage fluids than men, with subject age also possibly affecting lavage uric acid.

Of particular interest was ascorbic acid (AA), an antioxidant reported to be protective against O3 injury and found to be increased in O3-adapted rats. Adaptation was induced by exposure to 0.25 ppm O3, 12 hr/day for 6 or 14 weeks and evaluated with a challenge test, one that reexposed rats to 1.0 ppm O3 and measured attenuation in the O3 effect on frequency of breathing. Pulmonary function was assessed 1 day postexposure and adaptation and BALF were evaluated 1, 3, and 7 days postexposure. Results showed that forced vital capacity increased over time but decreased due to exposure and that the 14-week, O3-exposed rats had an increase in forced expiratory flow rate. All of the O3-exposed rats that were tested demonstrated adaptation on Postexposure Days 1, 3, and 7, but it was diminished on Day 7. Adaptation was also more pronounced in rats exposed for 14 weeks. Except for AA, BALF levels of total protein, potassium, lysozyme, uric acid, and alpha-tocopherol were unaffected by O3 exposure. Lactic acid dehydrogenase, alkaline phosphatase, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, and total glutathione were also assayed but were always below detectable limits. Ascorbic acid concentrations were elevated on Days 1, 3, and 7, showing postexposure patterns similar to those found for adaptation.

Studies in the USA have reported adverse effects on lung function among children but no comparable studies have been published in the UK. This study investigates the relationship between daily changes in ambient air pollution and short term variations in lung function in a panel of school children. METHODS: One hundred and fifty four children aged 7-11 attending a primary school adjacent to a major motorway in Surrey, south-east England, were studied. Bellows spirometry was performed daily on 31 schooldays between 6 June and 21 July 1994. Levels of ozone, nitrogen dioxide, and particulates of less than 10 microns in diameter (PM10) were measured continuously at the school and the pollen count was measured six miles away. Relationships between daily changes in forced expiratory volume in 0.75 seconds (FEV0.75), forced vital capacity (FVC), the FEV0.75/FVC ratio and pollutants were analysed using separate autoregressive models for each child. A weighted average of the resulting slopes was then calculated. RESULTS: There was a significant inverse relationship between daily mean PM10 levels lagged one day and FVC, with a reduction in lung function of 1% (95% CI 0.3% to 2%) across the whole range of PM10 levels (20-150 micrograms/m3). The effect on FEV0.75 was similar (-0.5%) but was not significant when weighted by 1/SE2 (95% CI -1.2% to 0.2%). There was no effect of PM10 levels on the FEV0.75/FVC ratio. No significant association was seen between FEV0.75, FVC, or the FEV0.75/FVC ratio and either ozone or nitrogen dioxide levels. There was no evidence that wheezy children were more affected than healthy children. Pollen levels on the previous day had no effect on lung function and did not change the air pollution results. CONCLUSIONS: There is a very small, but statistically significant, adverse effect of airborne respirable particulate matter, measured as PM10, on lung function in this study group.

Forestry workers and clerks had significantly higher airway resistances on ozone days, although having been exposed to the lowest ozone concentrations of all groups. Thus, on days with moderately elevated levels of ozone in the environment it is assumed that ozone itself has a minor influence on pulmonary responses compared to that of other constituents of the air in certain locations like in forests or indoors on these days.

Observations suggest that strong diurnal variations in surface-ozone mixing ratios are associated with elevated layers of ozone and other trace gases. The elevated layers were also associated with strong gradients of NOx both vertically, across the mixed layer, and horizontally, between urban and rural regions, providing evidence for the dominant role of localized anthropogenic NOx emissions over North America on ozone production in urban regions.

Absorbed fraction decreased, but sigma2 increased during O3 exposure, and the differences in deltalambda and in deltasigma2 between breathing air and exposure to either 0.12 ppm or 0.36 ppm O3 were significant.

Morning forced vital capacity (FVC) decreased significantly with increase in PM or NO2 measured over the preceding 24 hours. Morning-to-afternoon change of forced expired volume in one second (FEV1) became significantly more negative with increase in PM, NO2, or O3 on the same day. Predicted FVC or FEV1 loss on highest- vs lowest-pollution days was < 2%. Daily symptoms showed no association with current or prior 24-hour pollution, but increased with decreasing temperature. Parents' questionnaire responses suggested excess asthma and allergy in children from one polluted community while children in the other polluted community reported more symptoms, relative to the cleaner  community. We conclude that Los Angeles area children may experience slight lung function changes in association with day-to-day air quality changes, reasonably similar to responses seen by others in less polluted areas. Although short-term pollution effects appear small, they should be assessed in longitudinal lung function studies when possible, to allow maximally accurate measurement of longer-term function changes.",4.3.3,Personal-Ambient Concentration Relationships,0,0

Several cell types and their soluble mediators, including interleukin-1 (IL-1) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), are involved in the evolution of these responses. In this study, we have compared the effects of the combination of anti-IL-1 alpha and anti-TNF-alpha on in vitro and in vivo responses to inhaled O3. Male, Sprague-Dawley rats were exposed, nose-only, to 0.8 ppm O3 for 3 h and the in vitro and in vivo parameters were measured 8-12 h following exposure. The in vitro studies revealed that the adherence of inflammatory cells, primarily macrophages, harvested from the lungs of O3-exposed rats to cultured lung epithelial cells (ARL-14) was significantly greater than the adherence of macrophages from air-exposed controls. Furthermore, this adherence was significantly reduced in antibody-treated cells as compared to cells treated with preimmune rabbit serum. In vivo, elevations were found in the percentage of neutrophils in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF), transport of 99mTc-diethylenetriaminepentaacetate (DTPA) across the tracheal epithelium, and concentrations of total protein and albumin in BALF following O3 exposure. However, these effects were not significantly altered by treatment with the anti-IL-1 alpha/anti-TNF-alpha combination. Therefore, it was concluded that O3 affects the early stages of the inflammatory response, particularly with respect to macrophage activation and adherence to epithelial cells, and that this early response may be mediated by IL-1 alpha and/or TNF-alpha. The results also suggest that the in vivo effects of O3 are controlled by complex mechanisms involving factors other than IL-1 alpha and TNF-alpha, even though these cytokines are capable of modifying macrophage function as revealed by the in vitro adherence studies.",5.3.3,Initiation of inflammation,0,0

Follow-up O3 exposures were performed 4 and 7 d after the most recent consecutive exposure. All exposures were performed in an environmental chamber at 31 degrees C and 35% relative humidity. The subjects performed moderate exercise (mean ventilation rate of 32 l/min) for 15 min of each half-hour. Responses were measured with spirometry and symptom evaluations before and after each exposure, and a bronchial reactivity test (methacholine challenge) was conducted after each exposure. All response measurements showed clinically and statistically significant day-to-day variation. Symptom and forced-expiratory-volume-in-1-s responses were similarly large on the 1st and 2nd O3 exposure days, after which they diminished progressively, approaching filtered air response levels by the 5th consecutive O3 day. This tolerance was partially lost 4 and 7 d later. Bronchial reactivity peaked after the first O3 exposure and remained somewhat elevated after all subsequent O3 exposures, relative to its control level following filtered-air exposures. Individual responses varied widely; more severe initial responses to O3 predicted less rapid attenuation. We concluded that asthmatics can develop tolerance to frequent high-level O3 exposures in much the same manner as normal subjects, although the process may be slower and less fully effective in asthmatics.",6.2.1.1,Controlled Human Exposure,0,0

These three aldehydes primarily result from the Criegee ozonation of specific mono- or polyunsaturated fatty acids that are present in significant amounts in the rat lung; e.g., palmitoleic acid gives heptanal, oleic gives nonanal, and linoleic and arachidonic can give hexanal. Hexanal also is produced in the ozone-initiated autoxidation of any n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acid, and thus is a measure of generalized oxidative stress. (Monounsaturated fatty acids do not undergo appreciable autoxidation.) This detection and quantitation of aldehydes directly demonstrates for the first time that unsaturated fatty acids undergo Criegee ozonation in the lung when ozone is inhaled. Exposure to ozone alone produced smaller apparent yields of the three aldehydes than did exposure to ozone plus 5% CO2. Hexanal, heptanal, and nonanal can be detected in BAL of rats 5 hr after the end of the ozone exposure, but after more than 5 hr only hexanal can be found, probably from ozone-induced autoxidation of n-6 PUFA that continues after ozone exposure. The measured amounts  of  aldehydes  are  low,  and that, coupled with inherent biovariability, suggests that aldehydes may not be useful as quantitative dosimeters. However, they can be useful biomarkers, since some of these aldehydes (e.g., nonanal) are produced in ozone-specific pathways and aldehydes are the most easily detected among the lipid ozonation products (LOP). Furthermore, our identification of these aldehydes by BAL, coupled with our recognition that ozone itself cannot penetrate far enough into the lung to cause many of the effects associated with the inhalation of ozone, suggests that these aldehydes, as well as other types of LOP (such as hydroxyhydroperoxides and Criegee ozonides), may act as signal transduction molecules, activating lipases and causing the release of inflammatory molecules by a variety of pathways not yet entirely elucidated.",5.2.3,Ozone Reactions and Reaction Products,0,0

To determine whether differences in the delivered dose of O3 to the lung could help explain these differences, C3 and B6 mice were exposed to 18O-labeled ozone (18O3), and the resulting 18O concentrations in pulmonary tissues were monitored as an indicator of O3 delivered dose. Body core temperatures (Tco) of similarly treated mice were measured during O3 exposures (using surgically implanted temperature probes) in an effort to correlate lung O3 dose to changes in basal metabolism. Immediately after exposure to 18O3, C3 mice had 46% less 18O (per mg dry wt) in lungs and 61% less in tracheas than B6 mice. Nasal 18O tended to be lower in the C3 mice, but these differences were not significant. Although both strains responded to the O3 exposure with significant decreases in Tco, C3 mice had a 70% greater mean temperature x time product decrease during the exposure than B6 mice. These results suggest that the strain differences in O3 susceptibility may be due to differences in O3 dose to the lung, which may be related to differences in the ability of the mice to lower their Tco in response to O3 exposure.",5.5.2,Interspecies Homology of Response,0,0

In some lungs (9 or 10 each group), increasing doses of methacholine followed by capsaicin were injected into the pulmonary artery. In separate lungs (n = 5, each group), lung Substance P content by EIA and NK1 receptor characteristics by radioligand binding were measured. Analyses were performed by two-way ANOVA with a significant interaction indicative of C-fibers playing a role in ozone responses. Ozone increased R(L) and decreased C(dyn), effects which were apparently not dependent on C-fibers. Ozone increased responsiveness to methacholine, an effect which was reduced by depletion of C-fibers. Ozone increased and C-fiber depletion decreased lung responses to capsaicin. C-fiber depletion but not ozone decreased lung substance P content. C-fiber depletion increased the affinity but did not change the number of NK1 receptors, while ozone had no effect.

Broncho-alveolar lavage (BAL) was performed and protein content and differential  cell  counts were determined. RESULTS: Ozone increased bronchial responsiveness at 3 h but not at 24 h, while OA alone had no effect. At 3 h after ozone, OA induced further, but non-significant increases in bronchial responsiveness to ACh, but at 24 h after ozone, there was enhanced responsiveness. Neutrophil counts in BAL fluid increased at 3 and 24 h after exposure to ozone alone, but there were no further increases with ozone followed by OA exposure.

In 1992 and 1993, three groups of individuals were selected for personal monitoring of ozone exposure, based on prior expectations of their activity patterns. The first group spent a majority of the work day indoors or commuting, the second group spent more time outdoors and the third group spent the entire personal monitoring period outdoors. Time-activity data were collected for the first two groups and differences in personal ozone exposures were found to be associated with the fraction of time a person spent outdoors. Similarly, differences among groups in the mean ozone exposure were associated with time spent outdoors. These results and other exposure information were used to design a study of the health impacts of summer ambient air pollution that was conducted during the time period of the Pacific'93 field campaign. Aerosol acidity levels in the Fraser Valley were observed to be very low in 1992 so the health study focused on the effects of ozone exposure. The subjects were adult farm workers (26 male, 32 female; mean age 44.4, range 10-69) who spent the entire working day outdoors (a subset of group 3 above). Lung function measurements were made twice daily on each subject, once before and once after their work shift, from 23 June-26 August 1993. Ambient O3 concentrations were measured continuously at several nearby locations. In a regression model including individual lung function level, date, temperature and daily maximum O3, a statistically significant (p < 0.001) negative association was observed between ozone and lung function. This association between ozone and reduced lung function was still apparent the following day, suggesting a persistent ozone effect.

It is not known whether repeated exposure of humans to ozone also results in attenuation of the inflammatory response. In this study, 16 healthy young adult males were exposed to air and 0.4 ppm ozone for 2 h/day on 5 consecutive days, and again a single time 10 or 20 days after the initial 5-day ozone exposure. Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) was performed after 5 days of ozone exposure, after 5 days of air exposure, and a third time after the 10- or 20-day follow-up ozone exposure. Ozone-induced increases in percent polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs) and BALF levels of IL-6, PGE , elastase, and fibronectin were diminished after 5 days of expo2 sure.

However, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), elastase, IL-8, BALF total protein, 1-antitrypsin, and percent epithelial cells were not diminished. Reversal of ozone-induced attenuation was complex. Some mediators (PMNs, IL-6, PGE , fibronectin, recovery of viable cells) showed at least partial, if not complete, reversal within 10-20 days, while others (total protein, 1-antitrypsin) did not return to the normal response to ozone even after 20 days. We conclude from this study that increases in many cellular and biochemical mediators indicative of inflammation seen after a single exposure of humans to ozone are attenuated after 5 consecutive days of exposure. This attenuation is similar to attenuation of symptoms and lung function reported previously.

Kriging, a geostatistical interpolation technique, was used for the interpolation of hourly ozone data from 38 air quality monitoring stations operating within the study area, to derive concentration fields for the entire domain. The Urban Airshed Model(UAM-IV), a comprehensive photochemical grid-based model, was then used to calculate the same concentrations from emissions and meteorology inputs. Concentration fields, thus developed were linked with corresponding population data to calculate potential population exposure estimates to outdoor ozone (E(p,o)). The adequacy of kriging as an interpolation technique was evaluated by comparing E(p,o) estimates derived via photochemical UAM modeling with those calculated by using concentrations obtained from kriging UAM-calculated values at the locations of the monitoring stations. In general, UAM was found to predict higher E(p,o)compared to those derived by kriging observations. In order to test the robustness of the interpolation methodology with respect to assumptions of statistical correlation, two different semivariogram models, spherical and exponential, were used for kriging.

Each subject was exposed to 0.24 ppm O3 and to clean air (control) in an environmentally controlled chamber at 24 degrees C and 40% relative humidity. Exposures were randomized, they occurred 1 wk apart, and they lasted 4 h. During each half-hour interval, light exercise occurred (i.e., average ventilation 20 l/min) for 15 min. During both control and O3 exposures, group mean symptom intensity and specific airway resistance (SRaw) increased, whereas forced expiratory performance decreased. The healthy subgroup's mean arterial oxygen saturation (SaO2) rose slightly, and the COPD subgroup's mean SaO2 declined slightly, during exercise. Group mean forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1.0) declined significantly in O3 exposures, compared with controls (p approximately .01).

The authors computed the change in absorption resulting from exposure (delta lambda) by comparing the amount of each ozone bolus that was absorbed with a corresponding value obtained prior to exposure. Results indicated that ozone exposure caused delta lambda to decrease relative to air exposure (p < .01), whereas both nitrogen dioxide and sulfur dioxide exposures caused an increase in delta lambda that was not significantly different from air exposure. This resulted, at least in part, to an artifact caused by preexposure to ozone boluses.

There was a significant decrease in SP immunoreactivity following ozone exposure (median [interquartile range]: 0.6 [0.05 to 1.2] versus 0.15 [0.08 to 0.18], p < 0.05). A significant inverse correlation was observed between SP immunoreactivity and: (1) percent PMNs and ciliated epithelial cells in the BALF; and (2) percent change in FEV1 following exposure to ozone. These findings indicate that short-term exposure to 0.2 ppm ozone causes epithelial shedding and stimulates subepithelial sensory nerves to release SP into the airways. The release of SP could contribute to bronchoconstriction  and  subsequent neutrophil infiltration into the airways.",5.3.2,Activation of Neural Reflexes,0,0

Twenty-two asthmatics ages 9-46 years were followed for 8 weeks (9 May-3 July 1994) in a semirural Southern California community around the air inversion base elevation (1,200 ft). Daily diary responses included asthma symptom severity (6 levels), morning and evening peak expiratory flow rates (PEFR), and as-needed beta-agonist inhaler use.

Higher temperatures were strongly protective, probably due to air conditioning use and diminished indoor allergens during hot, dry periods.

OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to determine whether exposure to 0.16 ppm ozone induces eosinophilic inflammation in the lower airways of asthmatic subjects. METHODS: Eight asthmatic subjects sensitive to mites were exposed to 0.16 ppm ozone and clean air on separate occasions no less than 4 weeks apart in a double-blind, randomized fashion followed by bronchoscopy 18 hours later.

In Phase I, we measured the preexposure methacholine responsiveness of 86 normal subjects and then exposed these subjects to 0.2 ppm O3 for 4 hours with moderate exercise. Preexposure methacholine responsiveness was weakly correlated with O3-induced increases in specific airway resistance (sRaw) but not O3- induced declines in forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) or forced vital capacity (FVC). In addition, 03-induced lower respiratory symptoms were not well correlated with O3-induced changes in lung function. In Phase II, we exposed 23 normal subjects to O3, following an identical protocol to that of Phase I, and then performed bronchoscopy with proximal airway lavage (PAL), bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL), and bronchial biopsy at 18 hours after exposure. Ozone-induced increases in percentage of neutrophils and total protein concentration were observed in both bronchial fraction and BAL fluids; increased percentage of neutrophils also was observed in PAL fluid. These increases were correlated with O3-induced increases in sRaw, but not with O3-induced declines in FEV1 or FVG. Ozone also appeared to increase expression of intercellular adhesion molecule-i, an important mediator of neutrophil recruitment, in bronchial mucosa. In Phase III, we exposed a group of 19 asthmatic subjects to O3, following a protocol identical to that of Phase II. We then compared the lower respiratory symptom and lung function responses of the asthmatic subjects to those of the 81 normal subjects who participated in Phase I, Phase II, or both. The changes in the PAL and BAL fluids of the asthmatic subjects were compared with those of the normal subjects who participated in Phase II. Although both the asthmatic and nonasthmatic subjects showed significant O3-induced changes in lower respiratory symptoms, FEV1, FVC, and sRaw, no significant differences were found between the groups. For sRaw, however, a nonsignificant trend toward a greater O3-induced increase was noted for the asthmatic subjects. In contrast, the O3-induced increases in percentage of neutrophils and total protein concentration in BAL fluid were significantly greater for the asthmatic subjects than for the nonasthmatic subjects.

Exposure to ozone at levels near the National Ambient Air Quality Standard causes respiratory symptoms, changes in lung function, and airway inflammation. Although ozone-induced changes in lung function have been well characterized in healthy individuals, the relationship between airway inflammation and changes in pulmonary function have not been prospectively examined. The purpose of this study was to determine whether individuals who differ in lung function responsiveness to ozone also differ in susceptibility to airway inflammation and injury. A secondary goal was to determine whether ozone exposure induces airway inflammation in smokers, a population known to have airway inflammation and an increased burden of toxic oxygen species.  Healthy nonsmokers (n = 56) and smokers (n = 34) were exposed to 0.22 parts per million (ppm)* ozone for 4 hours, with intermittent exercise, for the purpose of selecting ozone ""responders"" (decrement in forced expiratory volume in 1 second [FEV1] > 15%) and ""nonresponders"" (decrement in FEV1 <5%). Selected subjects then were exposed twice to ozone (0.22 ppm for 4 hours with exercise) and once to air (with the same exposure protocol), each pair of exposures separated by at least 3 weeks, in a randomized, double-blind fashion. Nasal lavage (NL) and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) were performed immediately after one ozone exposure and 18 hours after the other, and either immediately or 18 hours after the air exposure. Indicators of airway effects in lavage fluid included changes in inflammatory cells, proinflammatory cytokines, protein markers of epithelial injury and repair, and generation of toxic oxygen species.  In the classification exposure, fewer smokers than non-smokers were responsive to ozone (11.8% vs. 28.6%, respectively); an insufficient number of smoker-responders were identified to study as a separate group. In the BAL study, all groups developed a similar degree of airway inflammation, consisting of increases in interleukins 6 and 8 (maximal immediately after exposure), and increases in polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs), lymphocytes, and mast cells (maximal 18 hours after exposure). The increase in PMNs was inversely correlated with age (p = 0.013), but gender, nonspecific airway responsiveness, and allergy history were not predictive of inflammation. Alveolar macrophage production of toxic oxygen species decreased after ozone exposure in nonsmokers; however, not in smokers. Findings from nasal lavage did not mirror lower airway inflammatory responses in these studies. We conclude that, in response to ozone exposure, smokers experienced smaller decrements in lung function and fewer symptoms than nonsmokers; however, the intensity of the airway inflammatory response was independent of smoking status or airway responsiveness to ozone. Furthermore, the burden of toxic oxygen species following ozone exposure was greater for smokers than for nonsmokers. Subjects were young, healthy, and able to sustain exercise; the results may not be representative of nonsmokers or smokers in general. Nevertheless, the findings indicate that measuring symptoms and spirometric changes is not sufficient to assess the potential risks associated with ozone exposure.",5.3.3,Initiation of inflammation,0,0

Despite much research, the mechanisms of ozone- and oxidant-induced cellular injury are still uncertain. Ozone and secondary free radicals have been reported to cause the formation of aldehydes in biological fluids. One of the most toxic aldehydes formed during oxidant-induced lipid peroxidation is 4-hydroxynonenal (HNE). HNE reacts primarily with Cys, Lys, and His amino acids, altering protein function and forming protein adducts. The purpose of this study was to determine whether HNE could account for the acute effects of ozone on lung cells. Human subjects were exposed to 0.4 parts/million ozone or air for 1 h with exercise (each subject served as his/her own control). Six hours after ozone exposure, cells obtained by airway lavage were examined for apoptotic cell injury, and cells from bronchoalveolar lavage were examined for apoptosis, presence of HNE adducts, and expression of stress proteins. Significant apoptosis was evident in airway lung cells after ozone exposure. Western analysis demonstrated an increase in a 32-kDa HNE protein adduct and a number of stress proteins, viz., 72-kDa heat shock protein and ferritin, in alveolar macrophages (AM) after ozone exposure. All of these effects could be replicated by in vitro exposure of AM to HNE. Consequently, the in vitro results and demonstration of HNE protein adducts after ozone exposure are consistent with a potential role for HNE in the cellular toxic effects of ozone.",5.2.3,Ozone Reactions and Reaction Products,0,0

Since pulmonary injury produced by oxidant air pollutants like ozone is highly focal, involving primarily the trachea and centriacinar areas of the lung, measurements of alterations in antioxidant enzyme activities in whole lung may substantially underestimate changes occurring in target areas of the respiratory tract. We have applied a technique for preparation of lung specimens from well-defined anatomic locations to determine whether the focal injury associated with ozone exposure is related to an uneven distribution of antioxidant enzyme activity in the respiratory tract. Our study compared enzyme activities in rat and monkey, species which differ considerably in sensitivity to ozone-induced injury (monkey > rat). The activities of glutathione S-transferase varied less than twofold between different airway subcompartments for both the rat and monkey. Pulmonary veins had approximately 50% of the activity of airways in both species. Glutathione peroxidase activity was slightly higher in proximal compared to distal airways of the rat but was evenly distributed at all airway levels in the monkey. In both species, activity in pulmonary veins was lower than that in airways. The activity of superoxide dismutase was similar in rat and monkey and marked differences were not observed in the various subcompartments studied. Similarly, catalase activity was relatively evenly distributed in rat airways but, in the monkey, the distal bronchiole and lobar bronchus had marginally higher activity than the trachea. We conclude that: (1) measurement of antioxidant enzyme activities in anatomic subcompartments within the lung is feasible using microdissected specimens, (2) antioxidant enzyme activity can vary in different subcompartments of the lung of the same species. (3) the pattern of variation in enzyme activity differs by the enzyme and by species, and (4) species and subcompartment differences in ozone injury are not due primarily to differences in the distribution of antioxidant enzyme activity.",5.5.1,Interspecies Dosimetry,0,0

Data from regional monitoring stations established ambient hourly ozone concentrations. Personal ozone samplers correlated poorly with outdoor abmient monitors. Higher personal ozone exposures were associated generally with increased inhaler use, outdoor time, and physical activity. Children with asthma spent more time outdoors and were more active in the spring on high-ozone days and had the most trouble breathing, the most wheezing, and the most inhaler use on these days. Relationships between ozone and pulmonary function were erratic and difficult to reconcile with existing knowledge about the acute respiratory effects of air pollution.

Although a number of mechanisms have been proposed to account for this response, none appear to be fully explanatory. We examined the role interleukin (IL)-6 may play in the induction of adaptation to O3-induced pulmonary injury. A statistically significant 29-fold increase in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid IL-6 levels was observed in rats exposed to 0.5 ppm O3 during nighttime hours when compared with daytime hours even though similar kinetics of inflammation were induced by each exposure. Animals receiving an initial nighttime O3 exposure showed a lesser degree of inflammation following a subsequent O3 exposure when compared with animals which received an initial daytime exposure. Rats pretreated with IL-6 both intratracheally and intraperitoneally and subsequently exposed to O3 showed a lesser degree of cellular inflammation when compared with respective controls. Pretreatment of rats with anti-IL-6-receptor antibodies (ra) prior to the nighttime O3 exposure completely abrogated the O3-induced cellular adaptive response without effecting the inflammatory response induced by the initial nighttime O3 exposure. In fact, administration of anti-IL-6ra augmented the neutrophil influx following the second O3 exposure. Anti-IL-6ra treatment did not alter the pulmonary edema adaptive response, suggesting that the O3-induced cellular and edema adaptive responses are regulated by different mechanisms.

O3 reaction with egg PC occurred when AFT2 concentrations were reduced. 2) Aldehydes were produced in low yield during lung and BALF exposures in a time- and O3 concentration-dependent manner. 3) Diminishing BALF AH2 content lowered O3 uptake but increased aldehyde yields. Conversely, AH2 addition to egg PC increased O3 uptake but reduced aldehyde yields. Estimations of bioactive ozonation and autoxidation product accumulation within the ELF suggested possible nanomolar to low micromolar concentrations. The use of reaction products as metrics of O3 exposure may have intrinsic sensitivity and specificity limitations. Moreover, due to the heterogenous nature of O3 reactions within the ELF, dose-response relationships may not be linear with respect to O3 absorption.",5.2.3,Ozone Reactions and Reaction Products,0,0

To evaluate whether acute effects of ozone on lung functions could be attenuated by antioxidant vitamin supplementation, we conducted a randomized trial using a double-blind crossover design. Street workers (n = 47) of Mexico City were randomly assigned to take daily a supplement (75 mg vitamin E, 650 mg vitamin C, 15 mg beta carotene) or a placebo and were followed from March to August 1996. Pulmonary function tests were done twice a week at the end of the workday. During the followup, the mean 1-h maximum ozone level was 123 ppb (SD 5 40). During the first phase, ozone levels were inversely associated with FVC (beta = 21.60 ml/ppb), FEV1 (beta = 22.11 ml/ppb), and FEF25u75 (beta = 24.92 ml/ppb) (p < 0.05) in the placebo group but not in the supplement group. The difference between the two groups was significant for FVC, FEV1 , and FEF25u75 (p < 0.01).

We measured peak expiratory flow in the morning on the children's arrival at school and in the afternoon before their departure from school. Separately for morning and afternoon, we normalized each child's daily measurement of peak flow by subtracting his or her mean peak flow from the daily measurement. Child-specific deviations were averaged to obtain a morning and afternoon mean deviation (APEF) for each day. Mean 24-hour O3 level was 52 parts per billion (ppb; maximum 103 ppb); mean 24-hour PM2.5 and PM10 were 30 microg/m3 (maximum 69 microg/m3) and 49 microg/m3 (maximum 87 microg/m3), respectively. We adjusted moving average and polynomial distributed lag multiple regression analyses of APEF vs pollution for minimum daily temperature, trend, and season. We examined effects of PM2.5, PM10, and O3, on deltaPEF separately and in joint models. The models indicated a role for both particles and O3 in the reduction of peak expiratory flow, with shorter lags between exposure and reduction in peak expiratory flow for O3 than for particle exposure (0-4 vs 4-7 days). The joint effect of 7 days of exposure to the interquartile range of PM2.5 (17 microg/m3) and O3 (25 ppb) predicted a 7.1% (95% confidence interval = 11.0-3.9) reduction in morning peak expiratory flow. Pollutant exposure also predicted higher rates of phlegm; colinearity between pollutants limited the potential to distinguish the relative contribution of individual pollutants.

To test whether this variability is related to the local dose of ozone at the tissue site or to local concentrations of glutathione, we exposed adult male rhesus monkeys for 2 h to filtered air or to 0.4 or 1.0 ppm ozone generated from 18O2. Following exposure, lungs were split into lobes and specimens were selected by microdissection so that measurements could be made on airway tissue of similar branching history, including trachea, proximal (generation one or two) and distal (generation six or seven) intrapulmonary bronchi, and proximal respiratory bronchioles. One half of the lung was lavaged for analysis of extracellular components. In monkeys exposed to filtered air, the concentration of reduced glutathione (GSH) varied throughout the airway tree, with the proximal intrapulmonary bronchus having the lowest concentration and the parenchyma having the highest concentration. Exposure to 1.0 ppm ozone significantly reduced GSH only in the respiratory bronchiole, whereas exposure to 0.4 ppm increased GSH only in the proximal intrapulmonary bronchus. Local ozone dose (measured as excess 18O) varied by as much as a factor of three in different airways of monkeys exposed to 1.0 ppm, with respiratory bronchioles having the highest concentration and the parenchyma the lowest concentration. In monkeys exposed to 0.4 ppm, the ozone dose was 60% to 70% less than in the same site in monkeys exposed to 1.0 ppm. Epithelial disruption was present to some degree in all airway sites, but not in the parenchyma, in animals exposed to 1.0 ppm ozone. The mass of mucous and ciliated cells decreased in all airways, and necrotic and inflammatory cells increased. At 0.4 ppm, epithelial injury was minimal, except in the respiratory bronchiole, where cell loss and necrosis occurred, and was 50% that found in monkeys exposed to 1.0 ppm ozone.

The major aim of the present study was to determine whether these differences in response intensity could be accounted for by the O3 dose to the lower region of the lung. The relative O3 dose to the lower lung of groups of pregnant, lactating, and virgin female rats was estimated by measuring the incorporation of the 18O isotope into low-speed (cells) and high-speed (surfactant) pellets of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid immediately after acute exposure to 0.5-1.1 parts/million 18O3. The polymorphonuclear leukocyte (PMN) and protein inflammatory responses were established 20 h after acute exposure of identical physiological groups to 0.5-1.1 parts/million 16O3 (common isotope). A single regression of PMN inflammation data against surfactant 18O concentration for all physiological groups gave a linear relationship, indicating direct proportionality of PMN inflammation with this estimate of relative dose to the lower lung regardless of physiological status. This implies that the chemical species that react with surfactant molecules, i.e., O3 or its metabolites, are the same as or proportional to those chemical species responsible for initiating PMN inflammation. Additional experiments showed that lung tissue ascorbic acid concentration was significantly lower in pregnant and lactating rats than in virgin female rats. Although a causative relationship cannot be assumed, the deficit in tissue ascorbic acid concentration in pregnant and lactating rats compared with virgin female rats is consistent with their greater responsiveness and higher relative surfactant O3 dose.",5.2.3,Ozone Reactions and Reaction Products,0,0

In contrast, many of the ambient gas concentrations were reasonable surrogates of personal PM2.5 exposures. 

METHODS: Personal multipollutant exposures and corresponding ambient air pollution concentrations were measured for 43 subjects living in Boston, MA. The cohort consisted of 20 healthy senior citizens and 23 schoolchildren. Simultaneous 24-hour integrated PM2.5, O3, NO2, and SO2 personal exposures and ambient concentrations were measured. All PM2.5 samples were also analyzed for SO4 (sulfate). We analyzed personal exposure and ambient concentration data using correlation and mixed model regression analyses to examine relationships among (1) ambient PM2.5 concentrations and corresponding ambient gas concentrations; (2) ambient PM2.5 and gas concentrations and their respective personal exposures; (3) ambient gas concentrations and corresponding personal PM2.5 exposures; and (4) personal PM2.5 exposures and corresponding personal gas exposures. 

RESULTS: We found substantial correlations between ambient PM2.5 concentrations and corresponding personal exposures over the course of time. Additionally, our results support the earlier finding that summertime gaseous pollutant concentrations may be better surrogates of personal PM2.5 exposures (especially personal exposures to PM2.5 of ambient origin) than they are surrogates of personal exposures to the gases themselves.

Of 224 children contained in the original data set, 160 children were found to have longitudinal measurements of O3 concentrations in at least six months of 12 months of the study period. Data for these children were randomly split into two equal sets: one for model development and the other for model validation. Mixed models with various variance-covariance structures were developed to evaluate statistically important predictors for chronic personal ozone exposures. Model predictions were then validated against the field measurements using an empirical best-linear unbiased prediction technique. The results of model fitting showed that the most important predictors for personal ozone exposure include indoor O3 concentration, central ambient O3 concentration, outdoor O3 concentration, season, gender, outdoor time, house fan usage, and the presence of a gas range in the house. Hierarchical models of personal O3 concentrations indicate the following levels of explanatory power for each of the predictive models: indoor and outdoor O3 concentrations plus questionnaire variables, central and indoor O3 concentrations plus questionnaire variables, indoor O3 concentrations plus questionnaire variables, central O3 concentrations plus questionnaire variables, and questionnaire data alone on time activity and housing characteristics. These results provide important information on key predictors of chronic human exposures to ambient O3 for children and offer insights into how to reliably and cost-effectively predict personal O3 exposures in the future.

Fischer-344 rats were exposed to particles (0, 5, 50 mg/m3 EHC-93), ozone (0, 0.4, 0.8 ppm), or combinations of particles and ozone for 4 h. Changes in gene expression were measured using real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction immediately after exposure and following 24 h recovery in clean air. Both pollutants individually increased preproET-1, endothelin converting enzyme-1, and endothelial nitric oxide synthase mRNA levels in the lungs shortly after exposure, consistent with the concomitant increase in plasma of the 21 amino acid ET-1[1-21] peptide measured by HPLC-fluorescence. PreproET-1 mRNA remained elevated 24 h after exposure to particles but not after ozone, in line with previously documented changes of the peptide in plasma. Both pollutants transiently increased endothelin-B receptor mRNA expression, while ozone decreased endothelin-A receptor mRNA levels. Coexposure to particles plus ozone increased lung preproET-1 mRNA but not plasma ET-1[1-21], suggesting alternative processing or degradation of endothelins. This coincided with an increase in the lungs of matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2), an enzyme that cleaves bigET-1 to ET-1[1-32].

One probe, the [O3] response surface probe [O3]/[NOX], is used here as a chemical filter to select NOX-limited hours in the observations and the simulations. Other probes used here are the fraction NOZ/NOY, a measure of chemical aging, and a measure of the production efficiency of O3 per NOX converted, [O3] to [NOZ]. The key ambient measurements for all three probes are accurate [NO2] and a reliable estimate of total NOY. Good agreement is shown between models and observations in cases where local photochemical production dominates and where model emissions inputs are thought to be mostly complete.

Ideally, such maps would be based on a dense network of monitoring stations, but this does not exist. Instead, there are two main sources of information for dry deposition levels in the United States: one is pollution measurements at a sparse set of about 50 monitoring stations called CASTNet, and the other is the output of the regional scale air quality models, called Models-3. A related problem is the evaluation of these numerical models for air quality applications, which is crucial for control strategy selection. We develop formal methods for combining sources of information with different spatial resolutions and for the evaluation of numerical models. We specify a simple model for both the Models-3 output and the CASTNet observations in terms of the unobserved ground truth, and we estimate the model in a Bayesian way. This provides improved spatial prediction via the posterior distribution of the ground truth, allows us to validate Models-3 via the posterior predictive distribution of the CASTNet observations, and enables us to remove the bias in the Models-3 output. We apply our methods to data on SO2 concentrations, and we obtain high-resolution SO2 distributions by combining observed data with model output.

Little diurnal variation was identified in the CO, SO2, and Angstrom exponent profiles, although the Angstrom exponent profiles decreased with altitude. Boundary layer O-3 was greater in the afternoon, while lower free tropospheric O-3 was invariant at similar to 55 ppbv. The single scattering albedo increased from morning to afternoon (0.93 +/- 0.01-0.94 +/- 0.01); however, both profiles decreased with altitude. A cluster analysis of back trajectories in conjunction with the vertical profile data was used to identify source regions and characteristic transport patterns during summertime pollution episodes. When the greatest trajectory density lay over the northern Ohio River Valley, the result was large O-3 values, large SO2/CO ratios, highly scattering particles, and large aerosol optical depths. Maximum trajectory density over the southern Ohio River Valley resulted in little pollution. The greatest afternoon O-3 values occurred during periods of stagnation. North-northwesterly and northerly flow brought the least pollution overall. The contribution of regional transport to afternoon boundary layer O-3 was quantified. When the greatest cluster trajectory density lay over the Ohio River Valley (similar to 59% of the profiles), transport accounted for 69-82% of the afternoon boundary layer O-3. Under stagnant conditions (similar to 27% of the profiles), transport only accounted for 58% of the afternoon boundary layer O-3.

Reactions were performed with endocyclic (-pinene and 3-carene) and exocyclic (-pinene and sabinene) alkenes in dry and humid air and in the presence of the OH radical scavengers: cyclohexane, 1-propanol, and formaldehyde. A thermal desorption particle beam mass spectrometer was used to probe the identity and volatility of SOA components, and an iodometric-spectrophotometric method was used to quantify organic peroxides. Thermal desorption profiles and mass spectra showed that the most volatile SOA components had vapor pressures similar to pinic acid and that much of the SOA consisted of less volatile species that were probably oligomeric compounds. Peroxide analyses indicated that the SOA was predominantly organic peroxides, providing evidence that the oligomers were mostly peroxyhemiacetals formed by heterogeneous reactions of hydroperoxides and aldehydes. For example, it was estimated that organic peroxides contributed ~47 and ~85% of the SOA mass formed in the - and -pinene reactions, respectively. Reactions performed with different OH radical scavengers indicated that most of the hydroperoxides were formed through the hydroperoxide channel rather than by reactions of stabilized Criegee intermediates. The effect of the OH radical scavenger on the SOA yield was also investigated, and the results were consistent with results of recent experiments and model simulations that support a mechanism based on changes in the [HO2]/[RO2] ratios.

Simulated aerosol mass concentrations compared reasonably well with the measured SOA data after absorptive partitioning coefficients were increased by a factor of between 20 and 80, although the simulated onset of SOA growth was delayed with respect to the experiments. A simplified representation of peroxyhemiacetal adduct formation, from the reaction of organic hydroperoxides with aldehydes in the condensed organic phase, was included in the mechanism and this reduced the required scaling of partitioning coefficients and reduced the time-lag in simulated SOA growth. These observations, and the dependence of SOA formation efficiency upon the initial NO concentration, strongly imply the significant occurrence of association reactions in the condensed organic phase and the important role of organic hydroperoxides in SOA formation.

The present study was designed to compare the pulmonary function and symptoms of breathing discomfort responses to a 6.6-h square-wave 0.08-ppm O3 chamber exposure to those observed in a triangular O3 exposure profile (mean of 0.08 ppm), as well as to both a 0.06-ppm square-wave and triangular mean 0.06-ppm exposure, and to those observed during a triangular mean 0.04-ppm exposure and to a filtered air (FA) square-wave exposure. Thirty young adults (15 of each gender) served as subjects, each completing all exposures. While the 6.6-h postexposure responses to the acute triangular exposure to a mean O3 concentration of 0.08 ppm did not differ significantly from those observed in the square-wave exposure, forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV)1.0 and total symptoms severity (TSS) were significantly different from preexposure at 4.6 h (when O3 concentration was 0.15 ppm) in the triangular exposure, but not until 6.6 h in the square-wave exposure. Thus, significant pulmonary function and symptoms responses were observed over a longer period in the triangular exposure protocol at a mean O3 concentration of 0.08 ppm. These results support previous evidence that O3 concentration has a greater singular effect in the total inhaled O3 dose than do VE and exposure duration. Subtracting pulmonary function effects consequent to O3 exposure to existent 8-h average background levels (e.g., ~0.04 ppm, rather than those observed in FA exposures) from those observed at higher concentrations (e.g., ~0.08 ppm) represents a means of focusing the regulatory effort on effects that can be controlled. The greatest pulmonary function and symptoms responses observed for a 0.04-ppm triangular exposure were nearly the same as those for the FA square-wave exposure. Thus, results of the present study show that calculating the net pulmonary function effect of exposure to 0.08 ppm with ocorrectiono for FA response, or for that incurred for 0.04 ppm O3, does not result in any statistically significant difference.",6.2.1.1,Controlled Human Exposure,3.1.4.1.1,Controlled Human Exposure Studies

The impact of Asian emissions is explored in terms of both episodic enhancements and contribution to background concentrations. We find that variability in CO concentrations at the ground site was largely driven by North American emissions, and that individual Asian plumes did not cause any observable pollution enhancement episodes at Trinidad Head. Despite this, model simulations suggest that Asian emissions were responsible for 33% of the CO observed at Trinidad Head, providing a larger mean contribution than direct emissions from any other region of the globe.

These are preliminary experiments in a new project to study the health effects of particulate matter and associated gaseous copollutants. Briefly, two matched outdoor chambers capable of using real sunlight were utilized to generate two test atmospheres for simultaneous exposures to cultured lung cells. One chamber was used to produce a photochemically active system, which ran from sunrise to sunset, producing O3and the associated secondary products. A few hours after sunset, NO was added to titrate and remove completely the O3, forming NO2. In the second chamber, an equal amount of NO2and the same amount of the 55-component hydrocarbon mixture used to setup the photochemical system in the first side were injected. A549 cells, from an alveolar type II-like cell line grown on membranous support, were exposed to the photochemical mixture or theooriginaloNO2/hydrocarbon mixture for 5 h and analyzed for inflammatory response (IL-8 mRNA levels) 4 h postexposure. In addition, a variation of this experiment was conducted to compare the photochemical system producing O3and NO2, with a simple mixture of only the O3and NO2. Our data suggest that the photochemically altered mixtures that produced secondary products induced about two- to threefold more IL-8 mRNA than the mixture of NO2and hydrocarbons or O3. These results indicate that secondary products generated through the photochemical reactions of NOxand hydrocarbons may significantly contribute to the inflammatory responses induced by exposure to urban smog. From previous experience with relevant experiments, we know that many of these gaseous organic products would contribute to the formation of significant secondary organic particle mass in the presence of seed particles (including road dust or combustion products). In the absence of such particles, these gaseous products remained mostly as gases.

Temporal patterns differ for these two engine types that are used predominantly for passenger travel and goods movement, respectively. Rapid growth in diesel fuel use and decreasing NOx emission rates from gasoline engines have led to altered emission profiles. During the 1990s, on-road use of diesel fuel grew 3 times faster than gasoline. Over the same time period, the NOx emission rate from gasoline engines in California was reduced by a factor of ~2, while the NOx emission rate from diesel engines decreased only slightly. Diesel engines therefore grew in both relative and absolute terms as a source of NOx, accounting for about half of all on-road NOx emissions as of 2000. Diesel truck emissions decrease by 60-80% on weekends. Counterintuitive responses to these emission changes are seen in measured concentrations of ozone. In contrast, elemental carbon (EC) concentrations decrease on weekends as expected. Weekly and diurnal patterns in diesel truck activity contribute to variability in the ratio of organic carbon (OC) to EC in primary source emissions, and this could be a source of bias in assessments of the importance of secondary organic aerosol.",3.2.1,Sources of Precursors Involved in O3 Formation,0,0

BD and its 2-methyl analog, isoprene (ISO), are chemically similar but have very different toxicities, with ISO showing no significant carcinogenesis. Once released into the atmosphere, reactions with species induced by sunlight and nitrogen oxides convert BD and ISO into several photochemical reaction products. In this study, we determined the relative toxicity and inflammatory gene expression induced by exposure of A549 cells to BD, ISO, and their photochemical degradation products in the presence of nitric oxide. Gas chromatography and mass spectrometry analyses indicate the initial and major photochemical products produced during these experiments for BD are acrolein, acetaldehyde, and formaldehyde, and products for ISO are methacrolein, methyl vinyl ketone, and formaldehyde; both formed < 200 ppb of ozone. After exposure the cells were examined for cytotoxicity and interleukin-8 (IL-8) gene expression, as a marker for inflammation. These results indicate that although BD and ISO alone caused similar cytotoxicity and IL-8 responses compared with the air control, their photochemical products significantly enhanced cytotoxicity and IL-8 gene expression. This suggests that once ISO and BD are released into the environment, reactions occurring in the atmosphere transform these hydrocarbons into products that induce potentially greater adverse health effects than the emitted hydrocarbons by themselves. In addition, the data suggest that based on the carbon concentration or per carbon basis, biogenic ISO transforms into products with proinflammatory potential similar to that of BD products.",3.2.2,Gas Phase Reactions Leading to O3 Formation,0,0

However, the evidence linking these particles to adverse effects on the airways of asthmatic individuals is limited. The objective of this study was to investigate the possible adverse effects of Asian dust events on the respiratory functions and symptoms of subjects with bronchial asthma. 

METHODOLOGY: From March to June 2002, individuals were enrolled who had been diagnosed as having asthma by bronchial challenge or by their bronchodilator response. The patients were divided into three groups according to asthma severity: mild, moderate and severe. Patients with other major disease states were excluded. Patients completed twice-daily diaries monitoring PEF, respiratory symptoms, and daily activities. The daily and hourly mean levels of particulate matter <10 microm in diameter (PM(10)), as well as nitrogen dioxide (NO(2)), sulphur dioxide (SO(2)), ozone (O(3)) and carbon monoxide (CO) were measured at 10 monitoring sites in Incheon, Korea. 

RESULTS: Dust events occurred 14 times during the study period. On dusty days there were increased levels of PM(10), decreased levels of NO(2) and SO(2), and no change in the CO levels, compared to the levels on control days. An increase in PM(10) concentration was associated with increases in PEF variability of >20% (P<0.05), more night-time symptoms (P<0.05), and a decrease in the mean PEF (P<0.05), calculated by longitudinal data analysis. In contrast, there was no association between the PM(10) levels and bronchodilator inhaler use or daytime respiratory symptoms. Using a general additive Poisson regression model, a borderline association was noted between PM(10) and respiratory symptoms, with a relative risk of 1.05 (95% confidence interval (CI), 0.99--1.17). There was no association between the PM(10) concentrations and PEF measurements, with PEF variability of >20% between the morning and evening values and a relative risk of 1.05 (95% CI, 0.89--1.24) in all subjects.

89190,,,,Estimating contributions of outdoor fine particles to indoor concentrations and personal exposures: Effects of household characteristics and personal activities,,2006,"A study of personal, indoor, and outdoor exposure to PM2.5 and associated elements has been carried out for 37 residents of the Research Triangle Park area in North Carolina. Participants were monitored for 7 consecutive days in each of four seasons. One goal of the study was to estimate the contribution of outdoor PM2.5 to indoor concentrations and personal exposures on an individual basis. This contribution depends on the infiltration factor Finf, the fraction of outdoor PM2.5 remaining airborne after penetrating indoors. Relying on previous studies suggesting that sulfur has few indoor sources, we can estimate Finf for each house based on indoor/outdoor sulfur ratios. Since Finf depends on air exchange rates, we can also calculate the value by regressing the observed indoor/outdoor sulfur ratios on the measured air exchange rates. The two approaches are not completely independent but give excellent agreement (R2 = 0.96-0.99) in estimating the average infiltration factor for each house, thereby validating the air exchange rate measurements and providing considerable confidence in the reliability of Finf estimates. These estimates range from 0.26 to 0.89. Using the daily estimated infiltration factor for each house, we calculate the contribution of outdoor PM2.5 to indoor air concentrations, both for the full year and for the four seasons. We show that in summer when air conditioners were in use, the contribution of outdoor PM2.5 to indoor concentrations was at its lowest (averaging 0.50) for most homes, whereas the average infiltration factor for the other three seasons was 0.62-0.63. The indoor-generated contributions to indoor PM2.5 had a wider range (0-33  g/m3) than the outdoor contributions (5-22  g/m3). We then regress the calculated outdoor PM2.5 contribution to indoor air concentrations on measured residential outdoor concentrations. The regressions have moderately high R2 values (range 0.39-0.93), although we present evidence that these values should be treated as upper bounds rather than best estimates. 
A second goal was to calculate the ""outdoor exposure factor"" Fpex, the fraction of outdoor PM2.5 contributing to personal exposure. This can be done directly using the ratio of personal/outdoor sulfur measurements, or indirectly using a model depending on the fraction of time spent indoors. The direct measurements result in an estimate of 0.54 for the mean outdoor exposure factor, whereas the model predicts a mean value of 0.63. We find that the time-weighted model adds no value to our estimate of Fpex and discuss the possible reasons for this. Using the direct estimates of Fpex based on the sulfur ratios, we calculate the contribution of outdoor PM2.5 to personal exposure. The range of outdoor contributions to personal exposure (6-18  g/m3) is much smaller than the range of indoor contributions (6-34  g/m3). We regress this contribution on measured outdoor PM2.5. This regression is desired by epidemiologists attempting to relate health effects to outdoor particle concentrations, since it shows the strength of the relationship between exposure to particles of outdoor origin and the outdoor concentrations. The regressions again have moderately high R2 values (range 0.19-0.88), although again we show that these values should be treated as upper bounds.
A third but somewhat subsidiary goal was to estimate two remaining parameters that affect Finf: the penetration coefficient P and the deposition rate k, where these parameters are assumed to refer to sulfur and particles in the same size range as sulfur. We use two approaches, which, however, are not completely independent. Both involve using the indoor/outdoor sulfur ratio (or its inverse) and the air exchange rate (or its inverse). While the two approaches generally agree well on predicting P and k for individual homes, each includes some nonphysical estimates (e.g., P >1). Also, many of the estimates for k are not significantly different from zero. We conclude tha",4.2,General Exposure Concepts,0,0

Furthermore, it is shown that a correction for the effective temperature of the trace gas is essential and that a correction for the presence of aerosols needs to be accompanied by aerosol corrections to the cloud retrieval. A discussion of the error components and total retrieval uncertainty is given for March 1997. Tropospheric NO2 columns can be retrieved with a precision of 35 - 60% over regions with a large contribution of the troposphere to the total column.

However, there has only been little study of local variation in ozone resulting from variation in vehicular traffic patterns within communities. Homes of 78 children were selected from a sample of participants in 3 communities in the southern California Children's Health Study. Twenty-four hour ozone measurements were made simultaneously at a home and at a community central site monitor on two occasions between February and November 1994. Homes were geo-coded, and local residential nitrogen oxides (NOx) above regional background due to nearby traffic at each participant's home were estimated using a line source dispersion model. Measured home ozone declined in a predictable manner as modeled residential NOx increased. NOx modeled from local traffic near homes accounted for variation in ozone concentrations of as much as 17 parts per billion.

The diagnosis from these space-based observations is highly consistent with current understanding of surface ozone chemistry based on in situ observations. The satellite-derived ratios indicate that surface ozone is more sensitive to emissions of NOx than of VOCs throughout most continental regions of the Northern Hemisphere during summer.

The boundary layer NOx data provide top-down verification of a 50% decrease in power plant and industry NOx emissions over the eastern United States between 1999 and 2004. Observed NOx concentrations at 8-12 km altitude were 0.55 +/- 0.36 ppbv, much larger than in previous U.S. aircraft campaigns (ELCHEM, SUCCESS, SONEX) though consistent with data from the NOXAR program aboard commercial aircraft. We show that regional lightning is the dominant source of this upper tropospheric NOx and increases upper tropospheric ozone by 10 ppbv. Simulating ICARTT upper tropospheric NOx observations with GEOS-Chem requires a factor of 4 increase in modeled NOx yield per flash (to 500 mol/flash). Observed OH concentrations were a factor of 2 lower than can be explained from current photochemical models, for reasons that are unclear.

For particles, the strength of the personal-ambient association can differ by particle component and level of home ventilation. For gases, however, such as ozone (O3), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), and sulfur dioxide (SO2), the impact of home ventilation on personal-ambient associations is untested. We measured 24-hr personal exposures and corresponding ambient concentrations to PM2.5, sulfate (SO2-(4)), elemental carbon, O3, NO2, and SO2 for 10 nonsmoking older adults in Steubenville, Ohio. We found strong associations between ambient particle concentrations and corresponding personal exposures.

For both particles and gases, personal-ambient associations were highest for individuals spending most of their time in high- compared with low-ventilated environments. Cross-pollutant models indicated that ambient particle concentrations were much better surrogates for exposure to particles than to gases. With the exception of ambient NO2 in the fall, which showed moderate associations with personal exposures, ambient gases were poor proxies for both gas and particle exposures.

We conducted a time-series panel study of subjects with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), asthma, and ischemic heart disease (IHD) to evaluate whether daily levels of air pollutants have a measurable impact on the lung function of adult subjects with pre-existing lung or heart diseases.

METHODS: Twenty-nine patients with COPD, asthma, or IHD underwent repeated lung function tests by supervised spirometry in two one-month surveys. Daily samples of coarse (PM10-2.5) and fine (PM2.5) particulate matter were collected by means of dichotomous samplers, and the dust was gravimetrically analyzed. The particulate content of selected metals (cadmium, chrome, iron, nickel, lead, platinum, vanadium, and zinc) was determined by atomic absorption spectrometry. Ambient concentrations of nitrogen dioxide (NO2), carbon monoxide (CO), ozone (O3), and sulphur dioxide (SO2) were obtained from the regional air-quality monitoring network. The relationships between concentrations of air pollutants and lung function parameters were analyzed by generalized estimating equations (GEE) for panel data.

RESULTS: Decrements in lung function indices (FVC and/or FEV1) associated with increasing concentrations of PM2.5, NO2 and some metals (especially zinc and iron) were observed in COPD cases. Among the asthmatics, NO2 was associated with a decrease in FEV1. No association between average ambient concentrations of any air pollutant and lung function was observed among IHD cases.

CONCLUSION: This study suggests that the short-term negative impact of exposure to air pollutants on respiratory volume and flow is limited to individuals with already impaired respiratory function. The fine fraction of ambient PM seems responsible for the observed effects among COPD cases, with zinc and iron having a potential role via oxidative stress. The respiratory function of the relatively young and mild asthmatics included in this study seems to worsen when ambient levels of NO2 increase.",6.2.1.2,Epidemiology,0,0

This system has been designed to approach air quality as a whole by including state-of-the-science capabilities for modeling multiple air quality issues, including tropospheric ozone, fine particles, acid deposition, and visibility degradation. CMAQ was also designed to have multiscale capabilities so that separate models were not needed for urban and regional scale air quality modeling. By making CMAQ a modeling system that addresses multiple pollutants and different spatial scales, it has a ""one-atmosphere"" perspective that combines the efforts of the scientific community. To implement multiscale capabilities in CMAQ, several issues (such as scalable atmospheric dynamics and generalized coordinates), which depend on the desired model resolution, are addressed. A set of governing equations for compressible nonhydrostatic atmospheres is available to better resolve atmospheric dynamics at smaller scales. Because CMAQ is designed to handle scale-dependent meteorological formulations and a large amount of flexibility, its governing equations are expressed in a generalized coordinate system. This approach ensures consistency between CMAQ and the meteorological modeling system. The generalized coordinate system determines the necessary grid and coordinate transformations, and it can accommodate various vertical coordinates and map projections. The CMAQ modeling system simulates various chemical and physical processes that are thought to be important for understanding atmospheric trace gas transformations and distributions. The modeling system contains three types of modeling components (Models-3): a meteorological modeling system for the description of atmospheric states and motions, emission models for man-made and natural emissions that are injected into the atmosphere, and a chemistry-transport modeling system for simulation of the chemical transformation and fate. The chemical transport model includes the following process modules: horizontal advection, vertical advection, mass conservation adjustments for advection processes, horizontal diffusion, vertical diffusion, gas-phase chemical reactions and solvers, photolytic rate computation, aqueous-phase reactions and cloud mixing, aerosol dynamics, size distributions and chemistry, plume chemistry effects, and gas and aerosol deposition velocity estimation.

The module incorporates updated opacity at each time step, based on changes in local ozone, nitrogen dioxide, and particle concentrations. The module is computationally efficient and requires less than 5% more central processing unit time than using the existing CMAQ ""lookup"" table method for calculating j values. The main focus of the work presented here is to describe the new online module as well as to highlight the differences between the effective cross sections from the lookup-table method currently being used and the updated effective cross sections from the new online approach.

The aim of the present study was to assess the inflammatory effect of ambient O3 in healthy children using nitric oxide in exhaled air (eNO) as a noninvasive test. The study was performed on 6 groups of children (n = 11-15), aged 6.5 to 15 yr, who attended summer camps in rural areas of the south of Belgium in 2002. Ambient O3 concentrations continuously monitored in the camps ranged from 48 to 221 microg/m3 (1-h maximal concentration). Children remained outdoors during the experimental days, doing various recreational activities but no sports. Lung function tests (forced expiratory volume in 1 s [FEV1] and forced vital capacity [FVC]) and eNO were measured twice in each child in the morning and in the evening. While lung function tests did not show any consistent pattern of decrease at these O3 levels, a highly significant increase in eNO was found in all subjects from an ambient 1-h O3 level of 167 microg/m3. A multivariate analysis did not reveal any influence of age, gender, height, weight, and body mass index (BMI) of the children. The threshold for this O3-induced increase in eNO estimated benchmark dose analysis was 135 microg/m3 for 1-h exposure and 110 microg/m3 for 8-h exposure.

We constrain uncertainties in the chemistry of these isoprene nitrates using chemical transport model simulations in conjunction with observations over the eastern United States from the International Consortium for Atmospheric Research on Transport and Transformation (ICARTT) field campaign during summer 2004. The model best captures the observed boundary layer concentrations of organic nitrates and their correlation with ozone using a 4% yield of isoprene nitrate production from the reaction of isoprene hydroxyperoxy radicals with NO, a recycling of 40% NOx when isoprene nitrates react with OH and ozone, and a fast dry deposition rate of isoprene nitrates. Simulated boundary layer concentrations are only weakly sensitive to the rate of photochemical loss of the isoprene nitrates. An 8% yield of isoprene nitrates degrades agreement with the observations somewhat, but concentrations are still within 50% of observations and thus cannot be ruled out by this study. Our results indicate that complete recycling of NOx from the reactions of isoprene nitrates and slow rates of isoprene nitrate deposition are incompatible with the observations. We find that ~50% of the isoprene nitrate production in the model occurs via reactions of isoprene (or its oxidation products) with the NO3 radical, but note that the isoprene nitrate yield from this pathway is highly uncertain. Using recent estimates of rapid reaction rates with ozone, 20-24% of isoprene nitrates are lost via this pathway, implying that ozonolysis is an important loss process for isoprene nitrates. Isoprene nitrates are shown to have a major impact on the nitrogen oxide (NOx = NO + NO2) budget in the summertime U.S. continental boundary layer, consuming 15-19% of the emitted NOx, of which 4-6% is recycled back to NOx and the remainder is exported as isoprene nitrates (2-3%) or deposited (8-10%). Our constraints on reaction rates, branching ratios, and deposition rates need to be confirmed through further laboratory and field measurements.

These sources are quantified to give tropospheric ozone budgets for individual soundings that are consistent with tracers and meteorological analyses. On average, for NENA stations in July-August 2004, tropospheric ozone was composed of the following: 10-15% each local boundary layer and regional sources (the latter including that due to lightning-derived NO) and 20-25% stratospheric ozone, with the balance (~50%) a mixture of recently advected ozone and aged air of indeterminate origin.",3.4.1.1,Contributions from the Stratosphere,0,0

The ozone production rate in the troposphere, P(Ox ), varies from 2300 to 5300 Tg yr-1 across models describing the present-day atmosphere. The ensemble mean of P(Ox ) in models from the post-2000 literature is 35% higher than that compiled in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Third Assessment Report (TAR). Simulations conducted with the GEOS-Chem model using two different assimilated meteorological data sets for 2001 (GEOS-3 and GEOS-4), as well as 3 years of GISS GCM meteorology, show P(Ox ) values in the range 4250-4700 Tg yr-1; the differences appear mostly because of clouds. Examination of the evolution of P(Ox ) over the GEOS-Chem model history shows major effects from changes in heterogeneous chemistry, the lightning NOx source, and the yield of organic nitrates from isoprene oxidation. Multivariate statistical analysis of model budgets in the literature indicates that 74% of the variance in P(Ox ) across models can be explained by differences in NOx emissions, inclusion of nonmethane volatile organic compounds (NMVOCs, mostly biogenic isoprene), and ozone influx from stratosphere-troposphere exchange (STE). Higher NOx emissions, more widespread inclusion of NMVOC chemistry, and weaker STE in the more recent models increase ozone production; however, the effect of NMVOCs does not appear generally sensitive to the magnitude of emissions within the range typically used in models (500-900 Tg C yr-1). We find in GEOS-Chem that P(Ox ) saturates when NMVOC emissions exceed 200 Tg C yr-1 because of formation of organic nitrates from isoprene oxidation, providing an important sink for NOx.",3.2.2,Gas Phase Reactions Leading to O3 Formation,0,0

One TNF promoter variant (G-308A) affects expression of TNF and has been associated with inflammatory diseases; however, studies of asthma have been inconsistent. Because ozone produces oxidative stress, increased airway TNF, and inflammation, the associations of the -308 TNF polymorphism with asthma may vary by ozone exposure and variants of oxidant defense genes glutathione-S-transferase (GST) M1 and GSTP1. OBJECTIVES: To investigate the association of TNF G-308A with asthma and wheezing and to determine whether these associations vary with ozone exposure and GSTM1 and GSTP1 genotype. METHODS: We studied associations of TNF-308 genotype with lifetime and current wheezing and asthma among 3,699 children in the Children's Health Study. We examined differences in associations with community ozone and by GSTM1 null and GSTP1 105 Ile/Val (A105G) genotype. Results: Children with TNF-308 GG had decreased risk of asthma (odds ratio, 0.8; 95% confidence interval, 0.7-0.9) and lifetime wheezing (odds ratio, 0.8; 95% confidence interval, 0.7-0.9). The protective effects of GG genotype on wheezing outcomes were of greater magnitude in lower compared with higher ozone communities. These findings were replicated in the two cohorts of fourth-grade children recruited in 1993 and 1996. The reduction of the protective effect from the -308 GG genotype with higher ozone exposure was most marked in the GSTM1 null and GSTP1 Ile/Ile groups.

METHODS: We propose an interdisciplinary conceptual framework that brings together maternal and infant nutrition, air pollution exposure assessment, and cardiopulmonary and perinatal epidemiology. Five possible albeit not exclusive biologic mechanisms have been put forth in the emerging environmental sciences literature and provide corollaries for the proposed framework.

CONCLUSIONS: Protecting the environmental health of mothers and infants remains a top global priority. The existing literature indicates that the effects of PM on LBW, PTD, and IUGR may manifest through the cardiovascular mechanisms of oxidative stress, inflammation, coagulation, endothelial function, and hemodynamic responses.

They are capable of capturing the spatiotemporal evolution of tropospheric column ozone in response to regional or short time-scale events such as the 1997?1998 El Ni?o event and a 10?20 DU change within a few days.

Simulation from a chemical transport model corroborates most of the above structures, with small biases of <?5 DU and consistent seasonal cycles in most regions, especially in the southern hemisphere. However, significant positive biases of 5?20 DU occur in some northern tropical and subtropical regions such as the Middle East during summer. Comparison of GOME with monthly-averaged Measurement of Ozone and Water Vapor by Airbus in-service Aircraft (MOZAIC) tropospheric column ozone for these regions usually shows good consistency within 1? standard deviations and retrieval uncertainties.

The model described well the mean observed response data across the range of exposure conditions, including the periods of recovery in clean air. Predicted values of individual responses were distributed lognormally and appeared to accurately describe the distribution of observed responses. We observed that responsiveness to ozone decreased with age, that response was weakly related to body size, and that response was marginally more sensitive to changes in ozone concentration than to changes in minute ventilation.

A low-cost face-mask O3 exposure system was developed in this laboratory and found to produce closely similar pulmonary responses to those observed in prolonged exposures by U.S. EPA investigators. The primary purpose of the present study was to investigate the pulmonary function and subjective symptoms effects of 6.6-h square-wave exposure to 0.12 ppm O3 by these two methods using the same group of subjects. In addition, further investigation of pulmonary function and symptoms responses upon 6.6-h exposures to lower levels of O3 (0.04-0.08 ppm) were studied with the face-mask inhalation system. Thirty young adult subjects completed five 6.6-h exposures with six 50-min periods of exercise at an intensity requiring a minute ventilation rate (VE) of ~20 L/min/m2 of body surface area, each followed by 10 min of rest, except following 3 h when the rest period was lengthened for a lunch break. The total O3 doses for the chamber and face-mask exposures to 0.12 ppm O3 were not significantly different from each other, since the additional O3 dose during the 35 min lunch break in the chamber exposure was offset by a slightly lower average exercise VE (i.e., 19.1 L/min/m2). The data convincingly demonstrated that the two methods of exposing young adults to nearly identical total inhaled O3 doses at 0.12 ppm produce very similar pulmonary function, symptoms, and exercise ventilatory pattern responses. On the other hand, results of the 6.6-h face-mask exposures to 0.08 ppm O3 in the present study, compared to similar U.S. EPA exposure study results, revealed several incongruities that may be due primarily to high individual subject variability in responses to a relatively low O3 exposure.

Although numerous time-series studies have estimated associations between day-to-day variation in ozone levels and mortality counts, results have been inconclusive.

Objective: To investigate whether short-term (daily and weekly) exposure to ambient ozone is associated with mortality in the United States.

Design and Setting: Using analytical methods and databases developed for the National Morbidity, Mortality, and Air Pollution Study, we estimated a national average relative rate of mortality associated with short-term exposure to ambient ozone for 95 large US urban communities from 1987-2000. We used distributed-lag models for estimating community-specific relative rates of mortality adjusted for time-varying confounders (particulate matter, weather, seasonality, and long-term trends) and hierarchical models for combining relative rates across communities to estimate a national average relative rate, taking into account spatial heterogeneity.

Main Outcome Measure: Daily counts of total non?injury-related mortality and cardiovascular and respiratory mortality in 95 large US communities during a 14-year period.

Results: A 10-ppb increase in the previous week?s ozone was associated with a 0.52% increase in daily mortality (95% posterior interval [PI], 0.27%-0.77%) and a 0.64% increase in cardiovascular and respiratory mortality (95% PI, 0.31%-0.98%). Effect estimates for aggregate ozone during the previous week were larger than for models considering only a single day?s exposure. Results were robust to adjustment for particulate matter, weather, seasonality, and long-term trends.

During nasal breathing at a constant respiratory flow of 250 ml/s, lambda increased smoothly as Vp increased with 80% of the inhaled O3 absorbed in the upper airways and 90% absorbed at the distal end of the trachea. Oral breathing caused a distal shift of the lambda-Vp distribution to the extent that absorption in the upper airways was reduced to 50% and inhaled O3 was 90% absorbed only after a bolus reached the 13th bronchial generation. Therefore, an exercise-induced change from nasal to oral breathing can render the distal lung more susceptible to O3 damage because of an elevation in O3 dose. We also found that changing the peak inhaled bolus concentration over a 10-fold range of 0.4-4 ppm O3 did not affect the lambda-Vp distribution. This finding implies that the diffusion and chemical reaction dynamics that dictate O3 absorption are linear processes.",5.2.2,Ozone Uptake ,0,0

Health Service). Exposures to the common air pollutant ozone (O3) cause decrements in pulmonary function and induce airway inflammation that is characterized by infiltration of polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMNs; refs 1-4). Because of the impact that O3 may have on public health, it is critical to identify susceptibility factors. Highly reproducible, significant inter-individual variations in human pulmonary function responses to O3 support the hypothesis that genetic background is an important determinant. Initial analysis of PMN responses to O3 exposure in segregant populations derived from inflammation-prone (susceptible) C57BLI6J (B6) and inflammation-resistant C3H/HeJ (C3) inbred mice indicated that susceptibility was controlled by a locus we termed Inf2 (ref. 7). Subsequent analyses with recombinant inbred strains suggested that a more complex interaction of genes is involved. In this report, we identify a quantitative trait locus (QTL) for O3 susceptibility on chromosome 17. Candidate genes for the locus include Tnf, the gene encoding the pro-inflammatory cytokine tumour necrosis factor-x (Tnf). Antibody neutralization of the protein product of this putative candidate gene significantly protected against O3 injury in susceptible mice. These results strongly support linkage of O3 susceptibility to a QTL on chromosome 17 and Tnf as a candidate gene.",5.4.2.1,Gene environment Interactions ,0,0

The 3 Baltimore cohorts consisted of 20 healthy older adults (seniors), 21 children, and 15 individuals with physician-diagnosed chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD*). The 2 Boston cohorts were 20 healthy seniors and 23 children. All children were 9 to 13 years of age; seniors were 65 years of age or older; and the COPD participants had moderate to severe physician-diagnosed COPD. Personal exposures to particulate matter with aerodynamic diameters less than 2.5 microm (PM2.5), sulfate (SO(4)2-), elemental carbon (EC), ozone (03), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), and sulfur dioxide (SO2) were measured simultaneously for 24 hours/day. All subjects were monitored for 8 to 12 consecutive days. The primary objectives of this study were (1) to characterize the personal particulate and gaseous exposures for individuals sensitive to PM health effects and (2) to assess the appropriateness of exposure assessment strategies for use in PM epidemiologic studies. Personal exposures to multiple pollutants and ambient concentrations were measured for subjects from each cohort from each location. Pollutant data were analyzed using correlation and mixed-model regression analyses. In Baltimore, personal PM2.5 exposures tended to be comparable to (and frequently lower than) corresponding ambient concentrations; in Boston, the personal exposures were frequently higher. Overall, personal exposures to the gaseous pollutants, especially O3 and SO2, were considerably lower than corresponding ambient concentrations because of the lack of indoor sources for these gases and their high removal rate on indoor surfaces. Further, the impact of ambient particles on personal exposure (the infiltration factor) and differences in infiltration factor by city, season, and cohort were investigated. No difference in infiltration factor was found among the cohorts, which suggests that all subjects were exposed to the same fraction of ambient PM2.5 for a given ambient concentration. In addition, the results show significant correlations between ambient PM2.5 concentrations and corresponding personal exposures over time and provide further indication that ambient gaseous pollutant concentrations may be better surrogates for personal PM2.5 exposures, especially personal exposures to PM2.5 of ambient origin, than their respective personal exposures. These results have important implications for PM health effects studies that use regression models including both ambient PM2.5 and gaseous pollutant concentrations as independent variables, because both parameters may be serving as surrogates for PM2.5 exposures.",4.3.3,Personal-Ambient Concentration Relationships,0,0

We evaluated postnatal lung morphogenesis and function of infant monkeys after 5 mo of episodic exposure of 0.5 parts per million ozone beginning at 1 mo of age. Nonhuman primates were chosen because their airway structure and postnatal lung development is similar to those of humans.

Because multiple studies have reported associations between air pollution and asthma worsening, elevated levels of air pollution are cited as a possible trigger for increased asthma morbidity in urban areas. Few studies have prospectively followed panels of urban children with asthma to determine whether air pollution levels are associated with clinically relevant outcomes such as asthma exacerbations. Objective: To determine the association between levels of ambient air pollutants and asthma exacerbations in urban poor children with moderate to severe asthma. Methods: A school-based panel of children with difficult-to-control disease was followed over a period of 3 consecutive winters in Denver, Colo. The panel consisted of predominantly urban African American children with moderate to severe asthma. Levels of Environmental Protection Agency criteria air pollutants were measured on a daily basis with concurrent monitoring of lung function, bronchodilator use, symptoms, and asthma exacerbations. Results: After controlling for time-varying factors such as upper respiratory infections and meteorologic factors, a weak association was found between ambient carbon monoxide levels and bronchodilator use. Ozone levels were associated with daytime symptoms only. No association was observed between daily air pollution concentrations and daily levels of FEV1, peak flow, nighttime symptom scores, or asthma exacerbations over the 3-year period.

OBJECTIVES: We hypothesized that the functional polymorphisms of HMOX-1 ([GT](n) repeat), CAT (-262C>T -844C>T), and MNSOD (Ala-9Val) are associated with new-onset asthma, and the effects of these variants vary by exposure to ozone, a potent oxidant air pollutant. Methods: We assessed this hypothesis in a population-based cohort of non-Hispanic (n = 1,125) and Hispanic white (n = 586) children who resided in 12 California communities and who were followed annually for 8 years to ascertain new-onset asthma. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Air pollutants were continuously measured in each of the study communities during the 8 years of study follow-up. HMOX-1 ""short"" alleles (<23 repeats) were associated with a reduced risk for new-onset asthma among non-Hispanic whites (hazard ratio [HR], 0.64; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.41-0.99). This protective effect was largest in children residing in low-ozone communities (HR, 0.48; 95% CI, 0.25-0.91) (interaction P value = 0.003). Little evidence for an association with HMOX-1 was observed among Hispanic children.

Inhalation of urban particulate matter and ozone by rats has been shown to result in increased synthesis of the potent vasoactive peptide endothelin (ET)-1 in the lungs, with spillover into the circulation. In the present work, we have analyzed the interrelationships between responses of the three major endothelin isoforms, ET-1[1-21], ET-2[1-21], and ET-3[1-21], to inhaled pollutants at the peptide and gene expression levels. Fisher-344 rats were exposed for 4 hrs by nose-only route to clean air, urban particles EHC-93 (0, 50 mg/m3), ozone (0, 0.8 ppm), or ozone and particles together. Circulating levels of both the ET-1 [1-21] and ET-3[1-21] peptides were increased immediately after exposure to particulate matter or ozone. While expression of preproET-1 mRNA in the lungs increased, expression of preproET-3 mRNA decreased immediately after exposure. PreproET-2 mRNA was not detected in the lungs, and exposure to either pollutant did not affect plasma ET-2 levels. Co-exposure to ozone and particles, while altering lung preproET-1 and preproET-3 mRNA levels in a fashion similar to ozone alone, did not cause changes in the circulating levels of the two corresponding peptides. Thus, de novo synthesis of ET-3 in the lungs is not responsible for the increase of circulating plasma ET-3 after inhalation of pollutants, which implies regulation of preproET-3 at a remote site and, hence, systemic impacts of the pollutants. Upregulation of preproET-1 coupled with down-regulation of preproET-3 in the lungs of animals exposed to air pollutants implies a mismatch of local ET-1/ET(A) receptor-mediated vasoconstriction and ET-3/ET(B) receptor-mediated vasodilation.",5.3.8,Systemic Inflammation and Oxidative/Nitrosative Stress,0,0

Here, we show that 3beta-hydroxy-5-oxo-5,6-secocholestan-6-al (ChSeco), an ozonation product of cholesterol, induces Abeta aggregation, generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), and cytotoxicity in murine GT1-7 hypothalamic neurons. The formation of Abeta aggregates in situ was dose-dependent at ChSeco concentrations ranging from 1 to 20 microM. The increase in insoluble Abeta aggregates at increasing concentrations of ChSeco was accompanied by a decrease in soluble Abeta as evidenced by Western blot analysis. The formation of ROS in neuronal cells was found to be dose- and time-dependent with the magnitude being higher at 20 microM compared to 10 microM ChSeco or untreated controls. The increase in ROS was associated with depletion of GSH. The cytotoxicity induced by ChSeco involved changes in phosphatidylserine translocation, DNA fragmentation, and caspase 3/7 activity that are characteristic of apoptosis. Pretreatment of neuronal cells with Trolox, a water-soluble analog of alpha-tocopherol offered partial, but significant protection against ChSeco-induced cell death, whereas, N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC) completely prevented the cytotoxic effects of ChSeco. NAC and Trolox were without any effects on ChSeco-induced Abeta aggregation. Fibrillogenesis inhibitors, which inhibited Abeta aggregation, did not inhibit cell death induced by ChSeco, implying that ROS generation, and not Abeta aggregation, plays a major role in the observed cytotoxicity. However, since Alzheimer's and other neurodegenerative diseases are slow and progressive, the formation of Abeta aggregates in vivo by ChSeco may have long-term pathological consequences.",5.4.2.1,Gene environment Interactions ,0,0

The physiologic and biologic responses to these toxins were evaluated by the extent of airway responsiveness, neutrophil recruitment to the lower respiratory tract, changes in inflammatory cytokines, and the concentration of protein in the lavage fluid.

To characterize the effect of this variability in emissions on ozone formation in Houston, data were collected on the temporal variability of industrial emissions or emission surrogates (e.g., mass flow rates to flares). The observed emissions variability was then used to construct regionwide emission inventories with variable industrial emissions, and the impacts of the variability on ozone formation were examined for two types of meteorological conditions, both of which lead to high ozone concentrations in Houston.

Despite its importance, all known instruments to detect HONO in the atmosphere suffer either from the great experimental effort necessary or from the possibility of significant interferences. In addition, only a few instruments are sensitive enough to detect low HONO concentrations during daytime. Accordingly, validated and sensitive measurements of nitrous acid are of paramount importance to describe the oxidation capacity of the atmosphere. Up to now, in intercomparisons of these chemical detectors with the well accepted DOAS technique significantly higher concentrations have been detected during the day with the chemical detectors, the discrepancy being attributed to interferences. In the present study, a recently developed HONO instrument (LOPAP) was validated against the DOAS technique, both in the field and in a large smog chamber under various conditions. Since sampling artefacts were minimised and interferences were measured and corrected for by the LOPAP instrument excellent agreement was obtained between these techniques during daytime as well as night-time. It is demonstrated that chemical instruments, which do not measure and do not correct interferences may significantly overestimate daytime concentrations of HONO caused by unknown interferences, which are particularly important during daytime, when HONO concentrations are low. For the DOAS technique, the possibility of HONO impurities in the NO2 reference spectra used for the spectral analysis needs to be treated actively in the evaluation process, to avoid a potential negative interference at low HONO/NO2 ratios. A simple procedure is presented that eliminates this possible error source in DOAS measurements of HONO in the atmosphere. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

All sites show a seasonal cycle with a spring or spring-summer maximum. By deseasonalizing the data, we are better able to identify seasonal and spatial patterns and long-term trends. For most of the locations in the western US that we considered, there are significant inter-site correlations in the deseasonalized monthly means. This indicates that there are large scale factors that influence the monthly mean O-3 concentrations across the western US. At seven out of nine sites in the western US, there is a statistically significant increase in O-3 with a mean trend of 0.26 bv year(-1) (range at the seven sites is 0.19-0.51 ppbv year(-1)). At three of the sites, we examined the data in more detail to find that the trends are present in all seasons. At the two sites in Alaska, no clear pattern was found. At the one ozonesonde site in the western US with long-term observations (Boulder, Colorado), no significant trend was identified. However, the statistical power in the ozonesonde analysis is limited due to the low frequency of ozonesonde launches. Temperature changes can explain only a fraction of the surface O-3 trend. We consider several possible explanations for these trends, including: increasing regional emissions, changes in the distribution of emissions, increasing biomass burning or increasing global background O-3.

Dust load and quality influenced the reduction of O-3; especially, diesel soot removed O-3 effectively. Increasing the RH resulted in a larger O-3 removal. The removal of O-3 was highest in the beginning of the test, but it declined within 2 h reaching almost a steady state as the exposure continued. However, the sooty filters continued to remove as much as 25-30% of O-3. Up to 11% of O-3 removed participated in the production of formaldehyde.

This paper describes a novel method of clustering trace gas and aerosol profiles allowing for the quantification of the relationship between point sources and pollution levels. This improves our understanding of pollution origins and has the potential for prediction of episodes of poor air quality. A hierarchical clustering method was used to classify distinct chemical and meteorological events from over 200 aircraft vertical profiles in the lower troposphere. Profile measurements included O3, SO2, CO and particle scattering from June to August 1997?2003, in the Mid-Atlantic US (mostly in Maryland, Pennsylvania and Virginia). The clustering technique could discriminate distinct profile shapes including measurements made during the 2002 Canadian forest fires. Forty-eight-hour back trajectories were run for each profile and the integrated NOx and SO2 point source emissions encountered by each trajectory were calculated using data from the EPA Clean Air Market Division's emissions database. There was a strong correlation between integrated NOx emissions and O3 profiles, indicating that O3 profiles are strongly influenced by and can be predicted with point source emissions.

The Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) model was utilized in photochemical simulations on a matrix of modeling scenarios permitting an examination of the separate effects of emission changes and meteorological influences on maximum ozone levels over a 3-month period during the summers of 2002 and 2004. Two modeling scenarios involved base case 2002 emissions and post-control emissions, reflecting the point source NOx emission reductions implemented before the ozone season of 2004, using summer 2002 meteorological conditions. Results revealed that point source NOx emission reductions caused decreases in daily maximum 8-h ozone concentrations over the eastern United States. At the 50th and 95th percentiles of the cumulative frequency distribution, daily maximum 8-h ozone values in the emission reduction scenario were lower than corresponding base case values over 70% and 90% of the modeling domain, respectively. During southwesterly wind flows across the Ohio River Valley, morning ozone concentrations aloft were lower over northeastern states downwind of the emissions-rich region in the NOx reduction scenario results. Another notable feature of the NOx emission reduction scenario results is that greater decreases in daily maximum 8-h ozone occurred at higher concentrations. Results from other modeling scenarios revealed strong differences in meteorological conditions between these two summer periods greatly impacted the daily 8-h maximum ozone concentrations with the meteorological effects on ozone being greater than those from emission changes over the northern part of the modeling domain.

The performance of the model in this region is evaluated, taking advantage of the highly time and size-resolved PM and gas-phase data collected during the Pittsburgh Air Quality Study (PAQS). PMCAMx uses the framework of CAMx and detailed aerosol modules to simulate inorganic aerosol growth, aqueous-phase chemistry, secondary organic aerosol formation, nucleation, and coagulation. The model predictions are compared to hourly measurements of PM2.5 mass and composition at Pittsburgh, as well as to measurements from the AIRS and IMPROVE networks. The performance of the model for the major PM2.5 components (sulfate, ammonium, and organic carbon) is encouraging (fractional errors are in general smaller than 50%). Additional improvements are possible if the rainfall measurements are used instead of the meteorological model predictions. The modest errors in ammonium predictions and the lack of bias for the total (gas and particulate) ammonium suggest that the improved ammonia inventory used is reasonable. The significant errors in aerosol nitrate predictions are mainly due to difficulties in simulating the nighttime formation of nitric acid. The concentrations of elemental carbon (EC) in the urban areas are significantly overpredicted. This is a problem related to both the emission inventory but also the different EC measurement methods that have been used in the two measurement networks (AIRS and IMPROVE) and the actual development of the inventory. While the ability of the model to reproduce OC levels is encouraging, additional work is necessary to confirm that that this is due to the right reasons and not offsetting errors in the primary emissions and the secondary formation. The model performance against the semi-continuous measurements in Pittsburgh appears to be quite similar to its performance against daily average measurements in a wide range of stations across the Eastern US. This suggests that the skill of the model to reproduce the diurnal variability Of PM2.5 and its major components is as good as its ability to reproduce the daily average values and also the significant value of high temporal resolution measurements for model evaluation.

Although ozone (O3) is an oxidant pollutant to which many people are exposed, few studies have examined whether O3 induces oxidative stress in humans. OBJECTIVES: This study was designed to assess the effect of short-and long-term O(3) exposures on biomarkers of oxidative stress in healthy individuals. METHODS: Biomarkers of lipid peroxidation, 8-isoprostane (8-iso-PGF), and antioxidant capacity ferric reducing ability of plasma (FRAP) were analyzed in two groups of healthy college students with broad ranges of ambient O3 exposure during their lifetimes and previous summer recess either in Los Angeles (LA, n = 59) or the San Francisco Bay Area (SF, n = 61). RESULTS: Estimated 2-week, 1-month, and lifetime O3 exposures were significantly correlated with elevated 8-iso-PGF. Elevated summertime exposures resulted in the LA group having higher levels of 8-iso-PGF than the SF group (p = 0.02). Within each location, males and females had similar 8-iso-PGF. No regional difference in FRAP was observed, with significantly higher FRAP in males in both groups (SF: p = 0.002; LA: p = 0.004). An exposure chamber substudy (n = 15) also showed a significant increase in 8-iso-PGF as well as an inhibition of FRAP immediately after a 4-hr exposure to 200 ppb O3, with near normalization by 18 hr in both biomarkers. CONCLUSIONS: Long-term exposure to O3 is associated with elevated 8-iso-PGF, which suggests that 8-iso-PGF is a good biomarker of oxidative damage related to air pollution.",5.3.8,Systemic Inflammation and Oxidative/Nitrosative Stress,0,0

The goal of these measurements was to obtain a comprehensive survey of ozone within Yosemite, which will help modelers predict and interpolate ozone concentrations in remote locations and complex terrain. The data from the portable monitors were combined with concurrent and historical data from two long-term monitoring stations located within the park (Turtleback Dome and Merced River) and previous investigations with passive samplers. The results indicate that most sites in Yosemite experience roughly similar ozone concentrations during well-mixed daytime periods, but dissimilar concentrations at night. Locations that are well exposed to the free troposphere during evening hours tend to experience higher (and more variable) nocturnal ozone concentrations, resulting in smaller diurnal variations and higher overall ozone exposures. Locations that are poorly exposed to the free troposphere during nocturnal periods tend to experience very low evening ozone, yielding larger diurnal variations and smaller overall exposures. Ozone concentrations are typically highest for the western and southern portions of the park and lower for the eastern and northern regions, with substantial spatial and temporal variability.

The Colorado Department of Public Health issues an air quality advisory daily during the high pollution season (November 1-March 31) with the objective of improving air quality through voluntary driving restrictions and a mandatory wood burning ban. We hypothesized that the advisory had no effect on commuter behavior due to lack of awareness and understanding, lack of alternative means of travel, or lack of concern. We mailed an anonymous, self-administered survey to 1000 commuters living in the cities of Boulder and Westminster, Colorado. Despite the fact that the vast majority of the respondents were aware of the daily advisory (94%), understood what it meant (93%), and heard the posting at least once a day (71%) in time to choose alternative forms of transportation, the advisory did not alter commuter travel. Commuters traveled mainly as the sole occupant of a car and most (76%) never changed the way they commuted based on the daily advisory. Many claimed schedules or work locations did not allow them to use alternative transportation methods.

The breathing mode, oral, nasal or oronasal, influences total deposition and relative fractions of the inhaled aerosois that will deposit in the extrathoracic and thoracic airways. Human models of airway deposition rely on standard values based on experimental data. In the absence of specific information, the pattem of airflow partitioning between the two routes is assumed to be similar in adults and in children. In order better to assess breathing modes in healthy subjects of various ages, for whom specific data are needed, the oronasal partitioning of ventilation during graded exercise was studied in 10 adults, aged 35 to 56 and 10 children, aged 8 to 16. During the test, oral and nasal flowrates were separately recorded, using a mouthpiece and a nasal mask. For all the subjects, the exercise test was symptom limited (SL) while for adults a safety limit was added to either cardiac frequency (CF > 160 min-1 ) or systolic blood pressure ISBP > 210 mm Hg or 28 kPa). Increments of power output were 25 W for adults and 10 W in children, each minute. It was observed that 6 adults out of 10 had an exclusively nasal ventilation at rest and switched abruptly to oronasal breathing during exercise when total ventilatory rate reached 38 to 65 l.min 1. Nine out of the 10 children already had oronasal ventilation at rest and merely increased their oral fraction from 20 to 84% of the total airflow at rest, up to 32 to 99% for the highest power output during the exercise test. The highest oral fractions were seen in the youngest children. The airflow partition between nose and mouth varied greatly among subjects, and this variability seems partly explained hy airway resistances. From these results and from those of the relevant literature, the conclusion is that the ventilatory behaviour, hoth at rest and during exercise tends to he age-dependent. To assess the possible effects of these observations on the reliability of the radiological doses recommended by ICRP, deposition was calculated for 1 and 5 ?m partieles in adults and for I ?m in children according to these data and compared with the model's defaults.",5.2.2.6,Interindividual Variability in Dose,0,0

We use satellite observations from the MOPITT, POLDER and MODIS sensors to evaluate the model performances in simulating the fire pollution export over the North Pacific. Our results show that aerosol and carbon monoxide (CO) outflow is best reproduced in our model when fire emissions are (1) increased to 72 Tg for CO, 0.5 Tg C for BC, and 5.3 Tg C for organic carbon over the entire fire season; (2) prescribed on a daily basis; and (3) injected up to 4.5 km in July and August. The use of daily, rather than monthly, biomass burning emission inventories improves significantly the representation of the aerosol outflow, but has little impact on CO. The injection of fire emissions above the boundary layer influences both the CO and aerosol columns but only during the late fire season. The model improvements with respect to the standard configuration induce an increase of a factor up to 2 on the aerosol optical thickness and the mass of BC deposited in the Northern Hemisphere. According to our improved simulation, the 2003 Russian fires contributed to 16-33% of the aerosol optical thickness and to 40-56% of the mass of BC deposited, north of 75 degrees N in spring and summer.

We evaluated the effect of prenatal exposure to six common urban air pollutants in the Sydney metropolitan area on preterm birth.

METHODS: We obtained information on all births in metropolitan Sydney between January 1, 1998 and December 31, 2000. For each birth, exposure to each air pollutant was estimated for the first trimester, the three months preceding birth, the first month after the estimated date of conception and the month prior to delivery. Gestational age was analysed as a categorical variable in logistic regression models.

RESULTS: There were 123,840 singleton births in Sydney in 1998-2000 and 4.9% were preterm. Preterm birth was significantly associated with maternal age, maternal smoking, male infant, indigenous status and first pregnancy. Air pollutant levels in the month and three months preceding birth had no significant effect on preterm birth after adjusting for maternal and infant covariates. Ozone levels in the first trimester of pregnancy and spring months of conception and sulphur dioxide were associated with increased risks for preterm births.

This paper describes the application of this instrument to ambient aerosol sampling. The AMS uses an aerodynamic lens to focus the particles into a narrow beam, a roughened cartridge heater to vaporize them under high vacuum, and a quadrupole mass spectrometer to analyze the vaporized molecules. Particle size is measured via particle time-of-flight. The AMS is operated in two modes: (I) a continuous mass spectrum mode without size information; and (2) a size distribution measurement mode for selected m/z settings of the quadrupole. Single particles can also be detected and sized if they have enough mass of a chemical component. The AMS was deployed at a ground sampling site near downtown Atlanta during August 1999, as part of the Environmental Protection Agency/Southern Oxidant Study Particulate Matter Supersite experiment, and at a suburban location in the Boston area during September 1999. The major observed components of the aerosol at both sites were sulfate and organics with a minor fraction of nitrate, consistent with prior studies and colocated instruments. Different aerosol chemical components often had different size distributions and time evolutions. More than half of the sulfate mass was contained in 2% of the ambient particles in one of the sampling periods. Trends in mass concentrations of sulfate and nitrate measured with the AMS in Atlanta compare well with those measured with ion chromatography-based instruments. A marked diurnal cycle was observed for aerosol nitrate in Atlanta. A simple model fit is used to illustrate the integration of data from several chemical components measured by the AMS together with data from other particle instruments into a coherent representation of the ambient aerosol.",3.3,Atmospheric Modeling,0,0

Smoke from these fires was observed over the continental United States in satellite images, and a variety of chemical tracers associated with the fires were sampled by aircrafts deployed during the International Consortium for Atmospheric Research on Transport and Transformation field experiment. Several recent studies have quantified the impacts of the long-range transport of pollution associated with these fires on tropospheric CO and O3 levels over the eastern United States. This study quantifies the episodic impact of this pollution transport event on surface-level fine particulate matter (PM2.5) concentrations over the eastern United States during mid-July 2004, through the complementary use of remotely sensed, aloft, and surface measurements, in conjunction with a comprehensive regional atmospheric chemistry-transport model. A methodology is developed to assimilate MODIS aerosol optical depths in the model to represent the impacts of the fires. The resultant model predictions of CO and PM2.5 distributions are compared extensively with corresponding surface and aloft measurements. On the basis of the model calculations, a 0.12Tg enhancement in tropospheric PM2.5 mass loading over the eastern United States is estimated on 19 July 2004 due to the fires. This amount is significantly larger (approximately a factor of 8) than the total daily anthropogenic fine particulate matter emissions for the continental United States. Analysis of measured and modeled PM2.5 surface-level concentrations suggests that the transport of particulate matter pollution associated with the fires resulted in a 24?42 % enhancement in median surface-level PM2.5 concentrations across the eastern United States during 19?23 July 2004.",3.4.1.2,Contributions from Other Natural Sources ,0,0

Children with asthma in inner-city communities may be particularly vulnerable to adverse effects of air pollution because of their airways disease and exposure to relatively high levels of motor vehicle emissions.

Objective

To investigate the association between fluctuations in outdoor air pollution and asthma morbidity among inner-city children with asthma.

Methods

We analyzed data from 861 children with persistent asthma in 7 US urban communities who performed 2-week periods of twice-daily pulmonary function testing every 6 months for 2 years. Asthma symptom data were collected every 2 months. Daily pollution measurements were obtained from the Aerometric Information Retrieval System. The relationship of lung function and symptoms to fluctuations in pollutant concentrations was examined by using mixed models.

Results

Almost all pollutant concentrations measured were below the National Ambient Air Quality Standards. In single-pollutant models, higher 5-day average concentrations of NO2, sulfur dioxide, and particles smaller than 2.5 ?m were associated with significantly lower pulmonary function. Higher pollutant levels were independently associated with reduced lung function in a 3-pollutant model. Higher concentrations of NO2 and particles smaller than 2.5 ?m were associated with asthma-related missed school days, and higher NO2 concentrations were associated with asthma symptoms.

Conclusion

Among inner-city children with asthma, short-term increases in air pollutant concentrations below the National Ambient Air Quality Standards were associated with adverse respiratory health effects. The associations with NO2 suggest that motor vehicle emissions may be causing excess morbidity in this population.",6.2.1.2,Epidemiology,3.1.5.4.3,Epidemiologic Studies

Here we investigated fire emissions during the 8 year period from 1997 to 2004 using satellite data and the CASA biogeochemical model. Burned area from 2001?2004 was derived using newly available active fire and 500 m. burned area datasets from MODIS following the approach described by Giglio et al. (2006). ATSR and VIRS satellite data were used to extend the burned area time series back in time through 1997. In our analysis we estimated fuel loads, including organic soil layer and peatland fuels, and the net flux from terrestrial ecosystems as the balance between net primary production (NPP), heterotrophic respiration (Rh), and biomass burning, using time varying inputs of precipitation (PPT), temperature, solar radiation, and satellite-derived fractional absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (fAPAR). For the 1997?2004 period, we found that on average approximately 58 Pg C year?1 was fixed by plants as NPP, and approximately 95% of this was returned back to the atmosphere via Rh. Another 4%, or 2.5 Pg C year?1 was emitted by biomass burning; the remainder consisted of losses from fuel wood collection and subsequent burning. At a global scale, burned area and total fire emissions were largely decoupled from year to year. Total carbon emissions tracked burning in forested areas (including deforestation fires in the tropics), whereas burned area was largely controlled by savanna fires that responded to different environmental and human factors. Biomass burning emissions showed large interannual variability with a range of more than 1 Pg C year?1, with a maximum in 1998 (3.2 Pg C year?1) and a minimum in 2000 (2.0 Pg C year?1).",3.4.1.2,Contributions from Other Natural Sources ,0,0

""Top-down"" assessment of emission strength and diurnal variation impacts","Wang, J; Christopher, SA; Nair, US; Reid, JS; Prins, EM; Szykman, J; Hand, JL",2006,"As is typical in the Northern Hemisphere spring, during 20 April to 21 May 2003, significant biomass burning smoke from Central America was transported to the southeastern United States (SEUS). A coupled aerosol, radiation, and meteorology model that is built upon the heritage of the Regional Atmospheric Modeling System (RAMS), having newly developed capabilities of Assimilation and Radiation Online Modeling of Aerosols (AROMA) algorithm, was used to simulate the smoke transport and quantify the smoke radiative impacts on surface energetics, boundary layer, and other atmospheric processes. This paper, the first of a two-part series, describes the model and examines the ability of RAMS-AROMA to simulate the smoke transport. Because biomass-burning fire activities have distinct diurnal variations, the FLAMBE hourly smoke emission inventory that is derived from the geostationary satellite (GOES) fire products was assimilated into the model. In the ?top-down? analysis, ground-based observations were used to evaluate the model performance, and the comparisons with model-simulated results were used to estimate emission uncertainties. Qualitatively, a 30-day simulation of smoke spatial distribution as well as the timing and location of the smoke fronts are consistent with those identified from the PM2.5 observation network, local air quality reports, and the measurements of aerosol optical thickness (AOT) and aerosol vertical profiles from the Southern Great Plains (SGP) Atmospheric Radiation Measurements (ARM) site in Oklahoma. Quantitatively, the model-simulated daily mean near-surface dry smoke mass correlates well with PM2.5 mass at 34 locations in Texas and with the total carbon mass and nonsoil potassium mass (KNON) at three IMPROVE sites along the smoke pathway (with linear correlation coefficients R = 0.77, 0.74, and 0.69 at the significance level larger than 0.99, respectively). The top-down sensitivity analysis indicates that the total smoke particle emission during the study period is about 1.3 ? 0.2 Tg. The results further indicate that the simulation with a daily smoke emission inventory provides a slightly better correlation with measurements in the downwind region on daily scales but gives an unrealistic diurnal variation of AOT in the smoke source region. This study suggests that the assimilation of emission inventories from geostationary satellites is superior to that of polar orbiting satellites and has important implications for the modeling of air quality in areas influenced by fire-related pollutants from distant sources.",3.4.1.2,Contributions from Other Natural Sources ,0,0

The main objectives of this deployment were to characterize the concentrations, size distributions, and temporal variations of nonrefractory (NR) chemical species in submicron particles (approximately PM1) and to further develop and evaluate the AMS. Reasonably good agreement was observed on particle concentrations, composition, and size distributions between the AMS data and measurements from collocated instruments (given the difference between the PM1 and PM2.5 size cuts), including TEOM, semicontinuous sulfate, 2-hour- and 24-hour-averaged organic carbon, SMPS, 4-hour-averaged ammonium, and micro-orifice uniform deposit impactor. Total NR-PM1 mass concentration in Pittsburgh accumulates over periods of several days punctuated with rapid cleaning due to rain or air mass changes. Sulfate and organics are the major NR-PM1 components while the concentrations of nitrate and chloride are generally low. Significant amounts of ammonium, which most of the time are consistent with sulfate present as ammonium sulfate, are also present in particles. However, there are periods when the aerosols are relatively acidic and more than 50% of sulfate is estimated to be in the form of ammonium bisulfate. No major enhancement of the organic concentration is observed during these acidic periods, which suggests that acid-catalyzed SOA formation was not an important process during this study. Size distributions of particulate sulfate, ammonium, organics, and nitrate vary on timescales of hours to days, showing unimodal, bimodal and even trimodal characteristics. The accumulation mode (peaking around 350?600 nm in vacuum aerodynamic diameter for the mass distributions) and the ultrafine mode (<100 nm) are observed most frequently. The accumulation mode is dominated by sulfate that appears to be internally mixed with oxidized organics, while combustion-emitted organics are often the main component of the ultrafine particles (except during nucleation events). The ultrafine-mode organic aerosols are mainly associated with combustion sources (likely traffic).",3.2.3,Multiphase Processes,0,0

PM is one of six principal (or criteria) pollutants for which EPA has established NAAQS. Periodically, EPA reviews the scientific basis for these standards by preparing an ISA (formerly called an Air Quality Criteria Document). The ISA and supplementary annexes, in conjunction with additional technical and policy assessments, provide the scientific basis for EPA decisions on the adequacy of the current NAAQS and the appropriateness of possible alternative standards. The Clean Air Scientific Advisory Committee (CASAC), an independent science advisory committee whose existence and whose review and advisory functions are mandated by Section 109 (d) (2) of the Clean Air Act, is charged (among other things) with independent scientific review of EPA's air quality criteria.

Under these conditions, an intense, shallow temperature inversion develops in the lowest 100m of the atmosphere, which traps high concentrations of ozone precursors at night.

A specialization of the general framework is that of predicting human exposure to air pollution that can be used to develop models for such things as exposure to particulate matter; practical aspects of their construction are considered. These models can help answer questions such as what fraction of the population sustained 'high' levels of exposure for say 5 days in a row. The immediate implementation of the above framework takes the form of a computing platform referred to as pCNEM.

The study site was under the influences of nitrogen oxide and hydrocarbon emissions from suburban automobile traffic. The most common ambient biogenic hydrocarbons measured within and above the forest included isoprene, alpha- pinene, and d-limonene. Isoprene was the most abundantly produced biogenic hydrocarbon, with maximum isoprene flux densities reaching 50 nmol m(-2) s(-1). Isoprene and its reaction products ( methyl vinyl ketone and methacrolein) comprised over 75% of the measured hydrocarbon mass. Substantial nitrate (NO3) and hydroxyl (HO) radical formation occurred within the forest canopy, with maximum NO3 and HO levels approaching 1 part per trillion on a volume basis (pptv) and 0.05 pptv, respectively. These NO3 and HO levels, combined with within-canopy ozone (O-3) mixing ratios of 60 parts per billion (ppbv), reacted with biogenic hydrocarbons and produced substantial amounts (0.6 ppbv) of peroxy radicals. The main conclusion from this investigation is that forested ecosystems capable of high rates (> 50 nmol m(-2) s(-1)) of biogenic hydrocarbon emissions, and in the vicinity of modest rates of nitrogen oxide emissions from suburban automobile traffic, can support a unique and active photochemistry within the forest canopy.

We employ sensitivity studies to elucidate the major uncertainties in the response of tropospheric O-3 to perturbations in biogenic volatile organic compounds (BVOC) emissions and reaction rate coefficients due to changes in temperature. The change in global O-3 burden due to an increase in BVOC emissions associated with a +5 K depends critically on the assumed treatment for the fraction of NOx recycled (0-100%) from isoprene nitrate (+9 to +34 Tg), in contrast to the chemical reaction rate coefficients response (-8 to -9 Tg). The model O-3 burden shows sensitivity (40 Tg) to the NOx recycling efficiencies (0-100%) similar to the burden's sensitivity to the grid resolution (4 degrees x 5 degrees -1 degrees x 1 degrees). The correlation of O-3 with total alkyl nitrates (Sigma ANs) in the surface air at a California forest site shows sensitivity to the NOx recycling (40-100%) similar to the correlation's sensitivity to the horizontal resolution (4 degrees x 5 degrees -1 degrees x 1 degrees). The results of the sensitivity simulations imply that the slope of O-3 to Sigma ANs might be used to constrain the yield of isoprene nitrate and NOx recycling fraction, but better agreement could be achieved by using a higher-resolution model with even higher NOx recycling from isoprene nitrate.

A large part of the variability in the data was quantitatively described by a simple parameterization from a previous study that uses measured mixing ratios of CO and either the transport age or the photochemical age of the sampled air masses.

Approximately 37% of the secondary formation can be accounted for by the removal of aromatic precursors using newly published particulate mass yields for low-NOx conditions, which are significantly higher than previous results. Of the secondary formation, 63% remains unexplained and is possibly due to semivolatile precursors that are not measurable by standard gas chromatographic methods.

Air pollution is associated with respiratory symptoms, lung function decrements, and hospitalizations. However, there is little information about the influence of air pollution on lung injury.

Objective
In this study we investigated acute effects of air pollution on pulmonary function and airway oxidative stress and inflammation in asthmatic children.

Methods
We studied 182 children with asthma, 9?14 years of age, for 4 weeks. Daily ambient concentrations of sulfur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide, ozone, and particulate matter ? 2.5 ?m in aerodynamic diameter (PM2.5) were monitored from two stations. Once a week we measured spirometry and fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO), and determined thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) and 8-isoprostane?two oxidative stress markers?and interleukin-6 (IL-6) in breath condensate. We tested associations using mixed-effects regression models, adjusting for confounding variables.

Results
Interquartile-range increases in 3-day average SO2 (5.4 ppb), NO2 (6.8 ppb), and PM2.5 (5.4 ?g/m3) were associated with decreases in forced expiratory flow between 25% and 75% of forced vital capacity, with changes being ?3.1% [95% confidence interval (CI), ?5.8 to ?0.3], ?2.8% (95% CI, ?4.8 to ?0.8), and ?3.0% (95% CI, ?4.7 to ?1.2), respectively. SO2, NO2, and PM2.5 were associated with increases in TBARS, with changes being 36.2% (95% CI, 15.7 to 57.2), 21.8% (95% CI, 8.2 to 36.0), and 24.8% (95% CI, 10.8 to 39.4), respectively. Risk estimates appear to be larger in children not taking corticosteroids than in children taking corticosteroids. O3 (5.3 ppb) was not associated with health end points. FeNO, 8-isoprostane, and IL-6 were not associated with air pollutants.

Four pollutants are considered?nitrogen oxide (NO), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), carbon monoxide, and ozone?represent varying levels of spatiotemporal heterogeneity. Among the methods, differences in central tendencies (mean, median) and variability (standard deviation) are modest. LUR and CMAQ perform well in predicting concentrations at monitoring sites (average absolute bias: <50% for NO; <20% for NO2). Monitors (LUR) offer the greatest (least) temporal resolution; LUR (monitors) offers the greatest (least) spatial resolution. Of note, the length scale of spatial variability is shorter for LUR (units: km; 0.3 for NO, 1 for NO2) than for the other approaches (3?6 for NO, 4?6 for NO2), indicating that the approaches offer different information about spatial attributes of air pollution.

We examined the potential contribution of exposure to ozone to the risk of death from cardiopulmonary causes and specifically to death from respiratory causes. 

Methods: Data from the study cohort of the American Cancer Society Cancer Prevention Study II were correlated with air-pollution data from 96 metropolitan statistical areas in the United States. Data were analyzed from 448,850 subjects, with 118,777 deaths in an 18-year follow-up period. Data on daily maximum ozone concentrations were obtained from April 1 to September 30 for the years 1977 through 2000. Data on concentrations of fine particulate matter (particles that are 2.5 ?m in aerodynamic diameter [PM2.5]) were obtained for the years 1999 and 2000. Associations between ozone concentrations and the risk of death were evaluated with the use of standard and multilevel Cox regression models. 

Results: In single-pollutant models, increased concentrations of either PM2.5 or ozone were significantly associated with an increased risk of death from cardiopulmonary causes. In two-pollutant models, PM2.5 was associated with the risk of death from cardiovascular causes, whereas ozone was associated with the risk of death from respiratory causes. The estimated relative risk of death from respiratory causes that was associated with an increment in ozone concentration of 10 ppb was 1.040 (95% confidence interval, 1.010 to 1.067). The association of ozone with the risk of death from respiratory causes was insensitive to adjustment for confounders and to the type of statistical model used. 

Conclusions: In this large study, we were not able to detect an effect of ozone on the risk of death from cardiovascular causes when the concentration of PM2.5 was taken into account.

However air quality modeling systems have the potential to alleviate some, although not all, of the limitations of monitoring networks. To investigate this application, exposure estimates were generated for a case study high ozone episode in the Northern Georgia Region of the United States based on measurements and concentration estimates from an air quality modeling system. Hourly estimates for 2268 4-km by 4-km gridcells were generated in a domain that includes only eight ozone monitors. Individual and population-based ozone exposures were estimated using multiple approaches, including area-weighted average of modeled estimates, nearest monitor, and spatial interpolation by inverse distance weighting and kriging. Results based on concentration fields from the air quality modeling system revealed spatial heterogeneity that was obscured by approaches based on the monitoring network. With some techniques, such as spatial interpolation, monitoring data alone was insufficient to estimate exposure for certain areas, especially for rural populations. For locations far from ozone monitors, the estimates from the nearest monitor approach tended to overestimate exposure, compared to modeled estimates. Counties in which one or more monitors were present had statistically higher population density and modeled ozone estimates than did counties without monitors (p-value < 0.05). This work demonstrates the use of air quality modeling to generate higher spatial and temporal resolution exposure estimates, and compares the advantages of this approach to traditional methods that use monitoring data alone. The air quality modeling method faces its own limitations, such as the need to thoroughly evaluate concentration estimates and the use of ambient levels rather than personal exposure.

Quantitative interpretation requires characterization of errors in HCHO column retrievals and relating these columns to VOC emissions. Retrieval error is mainly in the air mass factor (AMF) which relates fitted backscattered radiances to vertical columns and requires external information on HCHO, aerosols, and clouds. Here we use aircraft data collected over North America and the Atlantic to determine the local relationships between HCHO columns and VOC emissions, calculate AMFs for HCHO retrievals, assess the errors in deriving AMFs with a chemical transport model (GEOS-Chem), and draw conclusions regarding space-based mapping of VOC emissions. We show that isoprene drives observed HCHO column variability over North America; HCHO column data from space can thus be used effectively as a proxy for isoprene emission. From observed HCHO and isoprene profiles we find an HCHO molar yield from isoprene oxidation of 1.6 +/- 0.5, consistent with current chemical mechanisms. Clouds are the primary error source in the AMF calculation; errors in the HCHO vertical profile and aerosols have comparatively little effect. The mean bias and 1 sigma uncertainty in the GEOS- Chem AMF calculation increase from < 1% and 15% for clear skies to 17% and 24% for half-cloudy scenes. With fitting errors, this gives an overall 1 sigma error in HCHO satellite measurements of 25 - 31%.

OBJECTIVES: We conducted this analysis to reevaluate the existing lung function data of the volunteers previously exposed to 0.06 ppm O(3). METHODS: We obtained pre- and postexposure data on forced expiratory volume in 1 sec (FEV(1)) for all subjects who were previously exposed for 6.6 hr to filtered air or to 0.06 ppm or 0.08 ppm O(3). We used standard statistical methods appropriate for paired comparisons to reanalyze FEV(1) responses after exposure to 0.06 ppm O(3) relative to filtered air. RESULTS: Controlling for filtered air responses, 24 of the 30 subjects experienced an O(3)-induced decrement in FEV(1). On average, 0.06 ppm O(3) exposure caused a 2.85% reduction in FEV(1) (p < 0.002), which was consistent with the predicted FEV(1) response from existing models. Although the average response was small, two subjects had > 10% FEV(1) decrements.

Reductions in both nasal resistance and nitric oxide production with exercise may influence the efficiency of ozone uptake in the nose. Nasal ozone uptake was measured in 10 healthy volunteers before and after 15 min of moderate bicycle exercise. Ozone (0.2 parts/million) was pulled through both nostrils and out of the mouth at a constant flow while the subjects closed their epiglottises. Nasal uptake of ozone was determined by comparing the ozone concentration entering the nostrils to that exiting the mouth. Average preexercise uptake of ozone was 56 +/- 7.8 and 37 +/- 4.9% at 10 and 20 l/min, respectively. These averages did not significantly differ from those immediately postexercise (55 and 37%).

Variation in lung injury responses to oxidative stimuli such as ozone, particles, hyperoxia, and chemotherapeutic agents between genetically standardized inbred mouse strains has been demonstrated. In this review, we discuss quantitative trait loci (QTLs) which contain candidate genes that confer differential susceptibility to oxidative stimuli between strains in mouse models of airway toxicity and disease. We addressed multiple inflammatory, immunity, and antioxidant genes identified as candidate genetic determinants following these strategies, which include tumor necrosis factor (Tnf), toll-like receptor 4,(Tlr4), and the transcription factor NF-E2, related factor 2 (Nrf2). Mice with targeted deletion of these and related genes have provided initial proof of concept for their importance in the respective models. Interestingly, a few regions of the genome appear to have important roles in determining susceptibility to a number of stimuli which may suggest common genetic mechanisms in mice. Though more complete examination of functional association is required, results have potential implications for the role of these candidate genes in the pathogenesis of human pulmonary diseases including asthma, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), and emphysema.

In addition, staining ozone-exposed lung sections for active caspase 3 showed no apoptotic cells, but ethidium-positive cells colocalized with the orphan nuclear receptor, Nur77, a marker of nonapoptotic, programmed cell death mediated by the NK-1 receptor. An immortalized human airway epithelial cell line, human bronchial epithelial-1, showed no significant difference in the number of oxidant stress-positive cells during exposure to hydrogen peroxide and a range of SR140333 doses, demonstrating no antioxidant effect of the receptor antagonist.

Three-dimensional numerical solutions of the continuity, Navier?Stokes and convection?diffusion equations were obtained for steady inspiratory and expiratory flows at Reynolds numbers ranging from 100 to 500.

By combining these techniques, the location and severity of the nasal epithelial injury were correlated with epithelial type, nasal airway geometry, and local biochemical and molecular changes on an individual animal basis.

Using a time-series approach, we examined aggregated daily counts of preterm birth in relation to ambient levels of carbon monoxide, nitrogen dioxide, sulfur dioxide, ozone, particulate matter <10 microm in diameter (PM10), particulate matter <2.5 microm in diameter (PM2.5), and speciated PM measurements. Daily pollutant levels in 5-county Atlanta were characterized using a population-weighted spatial average of air quality monitors in the study area.

Relationships between average pollution levels during 3 gestational windows of interest were modeled using Poisson generalized linear models. Results were adjusted for seasonal and long-term time trends. RESULTS: Although most results were null, there were 3 positive associations between ambient pollution levels and preterm birth in the 4-mile capture-area analyses.

We designed mathematical airway models of three mammalian species, rats, dogs, and humans, in which interspecies differences in airway dimensions and respiratory patterns were taken into account. We then simulated the bulk flow of three gases (ozone [O3], nitrogen dioxide [NO2], and sulfur dioxide [SO2]) and obtained the intra-airway concentrations of the gases and the amount absorbed using these models. For all three gases, both real-time and mean concentrations in the upper and lower airways were higher in humans when compared with rats and dogs. For example, the mean concentration of O3 in the 5th bronchi of humans was 3 and 12 times higher than in rats and dogs, respectively. Similarly, the amount of absorbed gases corrected for airway surface area was again higher in the upper and lower airways of humans than the other two species.

Exposure assessment for epidemiological studies of long-term exposure to ambient air pollution remains a difficult challenge because of substantial small-scale spatial variation. Current approaches for assessing intra-urban air pollution contrasts include the use of exposure indicator variables, interpolation methods, dispersion models and land-use regression (LUR) models. LUR models have been increasingly used in the past few years. This paper provides a critical review of the different components of LUR models.

We identified 25 land-use regression studies. Land-use regression combines monitoring of air pollution at typically 20?100 locations, spread over the study area, and development of stochastic models using predictor variables usually obtained through geographic information systems (GIS). Monitoring is usually temporally limited: one to four surveys of typically one or two weeks duration. Significant predictor variables include various traffic representations, population density, land use, physical geography (e.g. altitude) and climate.

Land-use regression methods have generally been applied successfully to model annual mean concentrations of NO2, NOx, PM2.5, the soot content of PM2.5 and VOCs in different settings, including European and North-American cities. The performance of the method in urban areas is typically better or equivalent to geo-statistical methods, such as kriging, and dispersion models.

Further developments of the land-use regression method include more focus on developing models that can be transferred to other areas, inclusion of additional predictor variables such as wind direction or emission data and further exploration of focalsum methods. Models that include a spatial and a temporal component are of interest for (e.g. birth cohort) studies that need exposure variables on a finer temporal scale.

Methods: Pulmonary function was recorded on beach lifeguards at three different times during the day. Daily and average peak pollutant levels were calculated. Linear regression analyses were made comparing lung function changes in response to pollutant levels. A multivariate model was constructed to explain the combined effects of pollutants.

Results: Afternoon forced vital capacity (FVC) and forced expired volume in 1 second (FEV1) decreased significantly compared with morning values and decreased with increasing fine particulates (PM2.5). FEV1/FVC decreased with increasing ozone (O3) levels.

Increased extracellular [ATP] appeared due to ATP secretion or release because (1) inhibition of ectonucleotidase (cell surface enzyme(s) which degrade ATP) by ozone did not occur until >120 min of ozone exposure and (2) brefeldin A, a secretory inhibitor, eliminated elevation of extracellular [ATP] without affecting intracellular ATP. Extracellular ATP protected against ozone toxicity in a P2Y receptor-dependent manner as (1) removal of ATP and adenosine by apyrase and adenosine deaminase, respectively, potentiated ozone toxicity, (2) extracellular supplementation with ATP, a poorly hydrolyzable ATP analog ATPgammaS, or UTP inhibited apoptotic and necrotic ozone-mediated cell death, and (3) ATP-mediated protection was eliminated by P2 and P2Y receptor inhibitors suramin and Cibacron blue (reactive blue 2), respectively.

These pronounced susceptibility variations have remained largely undefined. We have postulated that interactions between inhaled O 3 and the airspace surfaces appreciably govern the distribution and extent of lung injury. O 3 displays unique absorption properties wherein chemical reaction with the epithelial lining fluid (ELF) maintains the net flux from the gas phase and couples O 3 uptake with the generation of products that lead to cell injury. Diversities in respiratory tract geometry and interfacial physicochemical conditions leads to spatially heterogeneous rates of O 3 flux into the ELF which combine with the local production of bioactive species to dictate the local dose. We have observed that both the uptake and distribution of acute epithelial injury is principally localized to the conducting airways. O 3 preferentially reacts with ELF ascorbic (AH 2 ) and uric acids (UA) although reaction with GSH and unsaturated fatty acids (UFA) occur to a lesser extent. UFA reactions may not generate sufficient bioactive materials to account for acute cell injury. Reactions with AH 2 and GSH, but not UA or Trolox, form secondary oxidants that initiate oxidation of model membranes and in vitro cell damage. However, secondary oxidant production is antioxidant concentration-dependent with a hyperbolic-shaped dose/response curve. Acquisition of species-specific data characterizing the pharmacodynamics of ELF substrate turnover under both basal and exposure conditions are critical to further our understanding of how surface chemistry regulates the balance between quenching of inhaled O 3 and conditions that promote production of bioactive/cytotoxic species and, therefore, biological outcomes.",5.2.3,Ozone Reactions and Reaction Products,0,0

Ozone is known to generate oxidized, proinflammatory lipids in lung lining fluid, such as 5beta,6beta-epoxycholesterol (beta-epoxide) and 1-palmitoyl-2-(9'-oxo-nonanoyl)-glycerophosphocholine (PON-GPC). Intratracheal instillation of either lipid caused substantial neutrophil influx in MARCO-/- mice, but had no effect in MARCO+/+ mice.

Ozone significantly modulated vascular tone regulation and increased oxidant stress and

TRAMP instruments recorded daytime HCHO pulses as large as 32 parts per billion (ppb) originating from upwind industrial activities in the Houston Ship Channel, where in situ surface monitors detected HCHO peaks as large as 52 ppb. Moreover, Ship Channel petrochemical flares were observed to produce plumes of apparent primary HCHO. In one such combustion plume that was depleted of ozone by large emissions of oxides of nitrogen (NOx), the Piper Aztec measured a ratio of HCHO to carbon monoxide (CO) 3 times that of mobile sources. HCHO from uncounted primary sources or ozonolysis of underestimated olefin emissions could significantly increase ozone productivity in Houston beyond previous expectations. Simulations with the CAMx model show that additional emissions of HCHO from industrial flares or mobile sources can increase peak ozone in Houston by up to 30 ppb. Other findings from TexAQS II include significant concentrations of HONO throughout the day, well in excess of current air quality model predictions, with large nocturnal vertical gradients indicating a surface or near-surface source of HONO, and large concentrations of nighttime radicals (approximately30 parts per trillion [ppt] HO2).

PM exposure augmented maternal lung inflammation and placental TNF, KC, and IL-6 (measured at gestation day 18).

Ozone is a major component of air pollution. Exposure to this powerful oxidizing agent can cause or exacerbate many lung conditions, especially those involving innate immunity. Surfactant protein-A (SP-A) plays many roles in innate immunity by participating directly in host defense as it exerts opsonin function, or indirectly via its ability to regulate alveolar macrophages and other innate immune cells. The mechanism(s) responsible for ozone-induced pathophysiology, while likely related to oxidative stress, are not well understood.

Methods

We employed 2-dimensional difference gel electrophoresis (2D-DIGE), a discovery proteomics approach, coupled with MALDI-ToF/ToF to compare the bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) proteomes in wild type (WT) and SP-A knockout (KO) mice and to assess the impact of ozone or filtered air on the expression of BAL proteins. Using the PANTHER database and the published literature most identified proteins were placed into three functional groups.

Results

We identified 66 proteins and focused our analysis on these proteins. Many of them fell into three categories: defense and immunity; redox regulation; and protein metabolism, modification and chaperones. In response to the oxidative stress of acute ozone exposure (2 ppm; 3 hours) there were many significant changes in levels of expression of proteins in these groups. Most of the proteins in the redox group were decreased, the proteins involved in protein metabolism increased, and roughly equal numbers of increases and decreases were seen in the defense and immunity group. Responses between WT and KO mice were similar in many respects. However, the percent change was consistently greater in the KO mice and there were more changes that achieved statistical significance in the KO mice, with levels of expression in filtered air-exposed KO mice being closer to ozone-exposed WT mice than to filtered air-exposed WT mice.

Conclusion

We postulate that SP-A plays a role in reactive oxidant scavenging in WT mice and that its absence in the KO mice in the presence or absence of ozone exposure results in more pronounced, and presumably chronic, oxidative stress.

Surfactant protein A (SP-A) enhances phagocytosis of bacteria, including Klebsiella pneumoniae, by alveolar macrophages. Ozone, a major air pollutant, can cause oxidation of surfactant and may influence lung immune function. Immune function may also be affected by sex-specific mechanisms. We hypothesized that ablation of SP-A has a negative impact on the susceptibility of mice to Klebsiella pneumoniae infection after ozone exposure, and that sex differences in the effect of ozone do exist.

Methods
Male and female SP-A (-/-) mice on the C57BL/6J background were exposed to ozone or to filtered air (FA) used as a control and then infected intratracheally with K. pneumoniae bacteria. Survival rate was monitored during a 14-day period. In addition, protein oxidation levels and in vivo phagocytosis were checked 1 h after inoculation of PBS used as a sham control and after inoculation of K. pneumoniae bacteria in PBS, respectively.

Results
We found: 1) ozone exposure followed by K. pneumoniae infection decreases survival and alveolar macrophage phagocytic function of SP-A (-/-) mice compared to filtered air exposure (p < 0.05), and females are more affected than males; 2) SP-A (-/-) mice (exposed either to ozone or FA) are more susceptible to infection with K. pneumoniae than wild type (WT) mice regarding their survival rate and macrophage phagocytic function; the phagocytic function of FA SP-A(-/-) is similar to that of ozone exposed WT. 3) ozone exposure appears to increase infiltration of PMNs, total protein, and SP-A oxidation in WT mice; infiltration of PMNs and total protein oxidation appears to be more pronounced in female mice in response to ozone; 4) ozone exposure increases SP-A oxidation in WT females significantly more than in males.

Conclusion
Absence (i.e. ablation of SP-A in SP-A (-/-) mice) or reduction of functional activity of SP-A (i.e. oxidation of SP-A in WT mice) increases the susceptibility of mice to experimental pneumonia after ozone exposure, and in both cases females are more affected by ozone exposure than males.

Wistar rats were administered either a CGRP-receptor antagonist (CGRP8?37) or saline and exposed to 8 hours of 1-ppm ozone or filtered air with an 8-hour postexposure period. Immediately after exposure, ethidium homodimer was instilled into lungs as a marker of necrotic airway epithelial cells. After fixation, airway dissected lung lobes were stained for 5'-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine, a marker of epithelial proliferation. Positive epithelial cells were quantified in specific airway generations. Rats treated with CGRP8?37 had significantly reduced epithelial injury in terminal bronchioles and reduced epithelial proliferation in proximal airways and terminal bronchioles. Bronchoalveolar lavage and sections of terminal bronchioles showed no significant difference in the number of neutrophils emigrating into airways in CGRP8?37-treated rats. The airway epithelial cell line, HBE-1, showed no difference in the number of oxidant stress positive cells during exposure to hydrogen peroxide and a range of CGRP8?37 doses, demonstrating no antioxidant effect of CGRP8?37. We conclude that activation of CGRP receptors during ozone inhalation contributes to airway epithelial injury and subsequent epithelial proliferation, a critical component of repair, but does not influence neutrophil emigration into airways.

This study further investigated the involvement of apoptotic-related proteins and gene expression using RT-PCR, Western blot, and appropriate biochemical assays. The RT-PCR analysis revealed that ChSeco activates the expression of genes involved in the death receptor (extrinsic) pathway. The significance of this pathway was also evident from the increased activity of caspase-8. The overexpression of Apaf-1, loss of mitochondrial transmembrane potential, release of cytochrome c, and increased activity of caspase-9 provide further evidence for the involvement of a mitochondrial (intrinsic) pathway. Time-course analysis of ChSeco-exposed H9c2 cells showed an upstream increase in the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and an associated decrease in the intracellular glutathione. N-acetyl-L-cysteine and Trolox significantly attenuated the ChSeco-induced ROS formation and cytotoxicity and also down-regulated the expression of the genes of all the players in either pathway.

Obese db/db and lean wild-type mice were exposed to ozone (0.3 ppm) for 72 h. In wild-type mice, ozone exposure caused pulmonary injury and inflammation, and these events were associated with reduced pulmonary compliance. In db/db mice, ozone-induced neutrophil recruitment to the lung was reduced and no reduction in compliance was observed. Similar results were obtained in obese Cpe(fat) mice, indicating that loss of leptin signaling in db/db mice does not account for these obesity-related changes. To examine the role of interleukin (IL)-6 in this obesity-related difference in ozone responsiveness, wild-type and IL-6-deficient mice were raised on 10% or 60% fat diets. Compared with 10% fat-fed mice, wild-type 60% fat-fed mice were obese and had reduced neutrophil recruitment following ozone. IL-6 deficiency reduced ozone-induced neutrophil recruitment in 10% fat-fed mice. In contrast, in obese mice, no effect of IL-6 deficiency on neutrophil recruitment was observed. Obesity-related differences in the effect of ozone on compliance were observed in both wild-type and IL-6-deficient mice. Obesity-related differences in serum IL-6 were observed and may account for obesity-related differences in the effect of IL-6 deficiency on neutrophil recruitment. In summary, the neutrophilic inflammation induced by prolonged low level ozone exposure was attenuated in obese mice and appeared to result from an absence of IL-6-dependent neutrophil recruitment in the obese mice.",5.4.2.2,Pre existing Diseases and Conditions,0,0

We created a rodent model of ozone-enhanced allergic nasal responses in Brown Norway rats to test the therapeutic effects of the dietary supplement gamma-tocopherol (gammaT). Ovalbumin (OVA)-sensitized rats were intranasally challenged with 0% or 0.5% OVA (in saline) on Days 1 and 2, and then exposed to 0 or 1 ppm ozone (eight hours/day) on Days 4 and 5. Rats were also given 0 or 100 mg/kg gammaT (p.o., in corn oil) on days 2 through 5, beginning twelve hours after the last OVA challenge. On Day 6, nasal tissues were collected for histological evaluation and morphometric analyses of intraepithelial mucosubstances (IM) and eosinophilic inflammation. Nasal septal tissue was microdissected and analyzed by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for mucin glycoprotein 5AC (MUC5AC) expression levels. Histological analysis revealed mild to moderate eosinophil influx in the mucosa lining the nasal airways and maxillary sinus of OVA-challenged rats (eosinophilic rhinosinusitis). Ozone exposure of allergic rats further increased eosinophils in the maxillary sinus (400%), nasolacrimal duct (250%), and proximal midseptum (150%). Storage of intraepithelial mucosubstances (IM) was not significantly affected by OVA challenge in filtered air-exposed rats, but it was increased by ozone in the septum (45%) and maxillary sinus (55%) of allergic compared to control rats. Treatment with gammaT attenuated the ozone/ OVA-induced synergistic increases in IM and mucosal eosinophils in both nasal and paranasal airways. gamma-Tocopherol also blocked OVA and ozone-induced MUC5AC gene expression.

However, daily metrics of the same pollutant have rarely been systematically compared within a study. In this analysis, we describe the variability of effect estimates attributable to the use of different temporal metrics of daily pollution levels. We obtained hourly measurements of ambient particulate matter (PM2.5), carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), and ozone (O3) from air monitoring networks in 20-county Atlanta for the time period 1993?2004. For each pollutant, we created (1) a daily 1-h maximum; (2) a 24-h average; (3) a commute average; (4) a daytime average; (5) a nighttime average; and (6) a daily 8-h maximum (only for O3). Using Poisson generalized linear models, we examined associations between daily counts of respiratory emergency department visits and the previous day's pollutant metrics. Variability was greatest across O3 metrics, with the 8-h maximum, 1-h maximum, and daytime metrics yielding strong positive associations and the nighttime O3 metric yielding a negative association (likely reflecting confounding by air pollutants oxidized by O3). With the exception of daytime metric, all of the CO and NO2 metrics were positively associated with respiratory emergency department visits. Differences in observed associations with respiratory emergency room visits among temporal metrics of the same pollutant were influenced by the diurnal patterns of the pollutant, spatial representativeness of the metrics, and correlation between each metric and copollutant concentrations. Overall, the use of metrics based on the US National Ambient Air Quality Standards (for example, the use of a daily 8-h maximum O3 as opposed to a 24-h average metric) was supported by this analysis.

For large-scale monitoring projects, where spatial variations of a pollutant and human exposure assessments are of interest, passive sampling devices can provide the methodology to meet monitoring and statistical goals. Recently we developed a coated filter for ozone collection that we used in a commercially available passive sampling device. Results from the ozone sampler validation tests are presented. The passive ozone sampler used in field and laboratory experiments consists of a badge clip suorting a barrel-shaped body which contains two coated glass fiber filters. The principal component of the coating is nitrite ion, which in the presence of ozone is oxidized to nitrate ion on the filter medium, NO2- + O3 --> NO3- + O2. After sample collection, the filters are extracted with ultrapure water and analyzed for nitrate ion by ion chromatography. The results from laboratory and field validation tests indicate excellent agreement between the passive method and standard ozone monitoring techniques. We have determined that relative humidity (ranging from 10 to 80 %) and temperature (ranging from 0 to 40-degrees-C) at typical ambient ozone levels (40-100 ppb) do not influence sampler performance.

The principal aim of the present study was to determine if acute exposure to environmentally relevant concentrations of O(3) could cause exacerbation of drug-induced liver injury in mice. Overdose with acetaminophen (APAP) is the most common cause of drug-induced liver injury in developed countries. In the present study, we examined the hepatic effects of acute O(3) exposure in mice pretreated with a hepatotoxic dose of APAP. C57BL/6 male mice were fasted overnight and then given APAP (300 mg/kg ip) or saline vehicle (0 mg/kg APAP).

Animals euthanized at 32 h were given 5-bromo-2-deoxyuridine (BrdU) 2 h before sacrifice to identify hepatocytes undergoing reparative DNA synthesis. Saline-treated mice exposed to either air or O(3) had no liver injury. All APAP-treated mice developed marked centrilobular hepatocellular necrosis that increased in severity with time after APAP exposure. O(3) exposure increased the severity of APAP-induced liver injury as indicated by an increase in necrotic hepatic tissue and plasma alanine aminotransferase (ALT) activity. O(3) also caused an increase in neutrophil accumulation in livers of APAP-treated animals. APAP induced a 10-fold increase in the number of bromodeoxyuridine-labeled hepatocytes that was markedly attenuated by O(3) exposure.

We sought to assess the association between chronic outdoor air pollution exposure, as measured by 12-month averages by county, and asthma among children in metropolitan areas across the nation. METHODS: Eligible children included those aged 3-17 years residing in US metropolitan areas who were sampled in the 2001-2004 National Health Interview Survey (N=34,073). 12-month average air pollutant levels for sulfur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide, ozone and particulate matter were compiled by county for 2000-2004. Eligible children were linked to pollutant levels for the previous 12 months for their county of residence. Adjusted odds ratios of having current asthma or an asthma attack in the past 12 months were estimated in single pollutant logistic regression models. RESULTS: Children in counties with ozone and, to a less consistent degree, particulate matter levels in the highest quartile were more likely to have current asthma and/or a recent asthma attack than children residing in counties with the lowest pollution levels; the adjusted odds for current asthma for the highest quartile of estimated ozone exposure was 1.56 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.15, 2.10) and for recent asthma attack 1.38 (95% CI: 0.99, 1.91).

The suitability of standard ozone exposure metric conversion ratios and implications for epidemiology,"Anderson, GB; Bell, ML",2010,"Several exposure metrics have been applied in health research and policy settings to represent ozone exposure, such as the 24 h average and daily 8 h maximum. Frequently, results calculated using one exposure metric are converted using a simple ratio to compare or combine findings with results using a different metric. This conversion, however, assumes that such a ratio is constant across locations and time periods. We investigated the appropriateness of this conversion method by examining the relationships among various forms of ozone concentrations (24 h average, daily 1 h maximum, and daily 8 h maximum) within and between communities for 78 US communities from 2000 to 2004 and compared results to commonly used conversion ratios. We explored whether the relationships between ozone exposure metrics differ by region, weather, season, and city-specific characteristics. Analysis revealed variation in the relationship among ozone metrics, both across communities and across time within individual communities, indicating that conversion of ozone exposure metrics with a standard ratio introduces uncertainty. For example, the average ratio of the daily 8 h maximum to the daily concentration ranged from 1.23 to 1.83. Within a community, days with higher ozone levels had lower ratios. Relationships among metrics within a community were associated with daily temperature. The community-average exposure metric ratios were lower for communities with higher long-term ozone levels. Ozone metric ratios differed by season because of the different rate of change of ozone metrics throughout the year. We recommend that health effects studies present results from multiple ozone exposure metrics, if possible. When conversions are necessary, more accurate estimates can be obtained using summaries of data for a given location and time period if available, or by basing conversion ratios on data from a similar city and season, such as the results provided in this study.",4.6.3.1,Short-Term Exposure,0,0

High concentrations of tropospheric ozone are toxic, however, and have a detrimental effect on human health and ecosystem productivity. Moreover, tropospheric ozone itself acts as an effective greenhouse gas. Much of the present tropospheric ozone burden is a consequence of anthropogenic emissions of ozone precursors resulting in widespread increases in ozone concentrations since the late 1800s. At present, east Asia has the fastest-growing ozone precursor emissions. Much of the springtime east Asian pollution is exported eastwards towards western North America. Despite evidence that the exported Asian pollution produces ozone, no previous study has found a significant increase in free tropospheric ozone concentrations above the western USA since measurements began in the late 1970s. Here we compile springtime ozone measurements from many different platforms across western North America. We show a strong increase in springtime ozone mixing ratios during 1995-2008 and we have some additional evidence that a similar rate of increase in ozone mixing ratio has occurred since 1984. We find that the rate of increase in ozone mixing ratio is greatest when measurements are more heavily influenced by direct transport from Asia. Our result agrees with previous modelling studies, which indicate that global ozone concentrations should be increasing during the early part of the twenty-first century as a result of increasing precursor emissions, especially at northern mid-latitudes, with western North America being particularly sensitive to rising Asian emissions. We suggest that the observed increase in springtime background ozone mixing ratio may hinder the USA's compliance with its ozone air quality standard.",3.4.2,Contributions from Anthropogenic Emissions,0,0

We first conducted an n-fold cross-validation of the model using samples of the original EPA data from which the model was developed. We then identified seven more recently published studies with controlled exposures to a wide range of ozone exposure patterns relevant to the current ambient ozone health standard and used the model to calculate the mean predicted responses for the exposure conditions of the individual studies that we compared to the mean observed responses reported in these studies. The n-fold cross-validation indicated good internal agreement between mean predicted and mean observed responses in the original data used to develop the model. The model accurately captured the patterns of response in each of the seven independent studies with a tendency to overpredict the observed responses by about 1 percentage point of FEV1 decrement on average. We conclude that the model is currently capable of predicting human FEV1 responses across a wide range of dynamic exposure conditions and anticipate further improvements in predictions with the addition of low-concentration exposure data.",6.2.1.1,Controlled Human Exposure,3.1.6.2.1,Lung Function

This paper estimates the statistical association between ambient ozone concentrations and asthma hospitalizations in Southern California while accounting for potential avoidance behavior in response to forecasted air quality. Data on asthma hospital admissions were merged with observed and forecasted air quality and meteorological data at the daily level for the years 1989-1997. A distributed lag Poisson generalized linear model allowing for overdispersion was estimated. Accounting for potential responses to information about pollution leads to significantly larger estimates of the relationship between ozone concentrations and asthma hospital admissions, particularly for susceptible populations.

Out of 350,000 sudden cardiac deaths each year in the United States, 60,000 deaths have been related to air pollution, suggesting a detrimental role of environmental pollutants in the development of CVD. The present study tested our hypothesis that chronic ozone exposure enhances the sensitivity to ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury in isolated perfused hearts. Sprague-Dawley rats were continuously exposed for 8 h/day for 28 and 56 days to filtered air or 0.8 ppm ozone. Isolated hearts were subjected to 30 min of global ischemia followed by 60 min of reperfusion. Cardiac function after I/R measured as left ventricular developed pressure (LVDP), +dP/dt, -dP/dt, and left ventricular end diastolic pressure (LVEDP) was significantly decreased and increased respectively in ozone-exposed I/R hearts compared to I/R hearts exposed to filtered air. The enhanced sensitivity to I/R injury upon ozone exposure was associated with increased myocardial TNF-alpha levels and lipid peroxidation and decreased myocardial activities of superoxidase dismutase (SOD) and IL-10. These data suggest that ozone-induced sensitivity to myocardial I/R injury may be due to promoting levels of oxidative stress as well as inflammatory mediators.",5.3.8,Systemic Inflammation and Oxidative/Nitrosative Stress,4.1.4.3,Animal Toxicological Studies

We used Poisson generalized linear models to estimate associations between current-day pollutant concentrations and circulatory emergency department visits for the 1998-2004 time period. Data from monitoring sites located in different geographical regions of the study area and at different distances from several urban geographical subpopulations served as alternative measures of exposure. We observed associations for spatially heterogeneous pollutants (CO and NO(2)) using data from several different urban monitoring sites. These associations were not observed when using data from the most rural site, located 38 miles from the city center. In contrast, associations for spatially homogeneous pollutants (O(3) and PM(2.5)) were similar, regardless of the monitoring site location. We found that monitoring site location and the distance of a monitoring site to a population of interest did not meaningfully affect estimated associations for any pollutant when using data from urban sites located within 20 miles from the population center under study. However, for CO and NO(2), these factors were important when using data from rural sites located > or = 30 miles from the population center, most likely owing to exposure measurement error.

We hypothesised that ozone exposure would exacerbate the pre-existent asthmatic airway inflammation despite regular inhaled corticosteroid treatment. Therefore, we exposed subjects with persistent asthma on inhaled corticosteroid therapy to 0.2 ppm ozone or filtered air for 2 h, on 2 separate occasions. Lung function was evaluated before and immediately after exposure, while bronchoscopy was performed 18 h post exposure. Compared to filtered air, ozone exposure increased airway resistance. Ozone significantly enhanced neutrophil numbers and myeloperoxidase levels in airway lavages, and induced a fourfold increase in bronchial mucosal mast cell numbers.

Response measures included pulmonary function and inflammatory indices in induced sputum (interleukin [IL]-6, cytology) and blood (IL-6, tumor necrosis factor [TNF]-alpha) measured before and after exposures. Three hours post exposure, there was an increase in blood levels of IL-6, but only after CAP alone exposures; the IL-6 increase was associated with increasing PM(2.5) mass concentration (p = .005). Some individuals switched to shallow breathing during CAP+O(3), possibly accounting for an attenuation of the resultant blood IL-6 response. Asthmatic and nonasthmatic responses were similar.

METHODS: Twenty-three well controlled, regularly treated, mild-to-moderate asthmatic patients underwent two sequential randomised exposures to either filtered air or ozone (0.3 ppm for 2 hours) in a challenge chamber. Pulmonary function (PF) was monitored, and patients with FEV1 decrease greater than 10% from pre-challenge value were considered as responders. Immediately after each exposure, exhaled breath condensate (EBC) was collected to measure malondialdehyde (MDA). Six hours after each exposure, PF and EBC collection were repeated, and sputum was induced to measure inflammatory cell counts and soluble mediators (IL-8 and neutrophil elastase). The response to ozone was also evaluated according to the presence of polymorphism in oxidative stress related NQO1 and GSTM1 genes. RESULTS: After ozone exposure, sputum neutrophils significantly increased in responders (n = 8), but not in nonresponders (n = 15). Other markers of neutrophil activation in sputum supernatant and MDA in EBC significantly increased in all patients, but only in nonresponders the increase was significant. In nonresponders, sputum eosinophils also significantly increased after ozone. There was a positive correlation between ozone-induced FEV1 fall and increase in sputum neutrophils. No difference in functional or inflammatory response to ozone was observed between subjects with or without the combination of NQO1wt- GSTM1null genotypes.

399328,,,,An investigation of inhaled ozone dose and the magnitude of airway inflammation in healthy adults: Supplementary materials,"Mudway, IS; Kelly, FJ",2004,"Exposure to ozone has been associated in epidemiologic and field studies with a range of health outcomes: increased daily mortality; impaired lung function; and inflammation and epithelial injury in recreational runners and cyclists, as well as increased hospital admissions for preexisting respiratory disease. A biological basis for these responses has been provided by findings from animal and human laboratory-based studies, where transient decrements in lung function, increased hyperreactivity, and airway inflammation have all been demonstrated after exposure to environmentally relevant concentrations of ozone. Although the database for ozone-induced health effects is considerable, a number of issues remain unresolved. The relationship between inhaled ozone dose and the magnitude of the resultant pulmonary response has been limited to a consideration of transient lung function decrements, as these measurements are noninvasive and easy to perform. Similar analyses addressing the relationship between ozone dose and acute pulmonary inflammation and tissue injury have not been performed. Here, the available database is more limited, and issues related to variation in study design, airway sampling, and the endpoints studied have made a similar approach more problematic. Establishing these relationships is vital in determining threshold doses of ozone below which adverse responses are negligible in the healthy population. As the magnitude of lung function decrements is not simplistically related to epithelial injury or inflammation, one cannot rely on estimates derived from these modeling studies to determine threshold values for these other biologically important endpoints. 
Here, we describe the first attempt to model the ozone doseuinflammatory response based on a metaanalysis of data from published human chamber studies, where airway responses were assessed using bronchoscopy-based lavage. Analyses of inflammatory responses were based on the percentage of neutrophils recovered by bronchoscopy-based lavage in response to a set ozone dose, expressed as a function of concentration (mg/m3), VE (L/minute/m2 body surface area), and exposure time (minutes) - CVT (mg/m2 body surface area). Analysis of altered permeability responses was more complex and relied on the fold increase in lavage total protein between the ozone and air exposures. This metaanalysis included data from 21 publications containing 23 exposures, with responses stratified into those measured early (0-6 hours) or late (18-24 hours) postexposure. 
We observed evidence of a relatively simple linear relationship between ozone dose (CVT) and neutrophilia in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid samples (r2 = 0.44, p < 0.01 at 0-6 hours, and r2 = 0.51, p < 0.01 at 18-24 hours), with the regressions cutting the upper 95% confidence interval of the control neutrophil level (postair) at CVT values of 645 (408-883) mg/m2, intercept with 95% confidence intervals at 0 to 6 hours, and 810 (491-1,130) mg/m2 at 18 to 24 hours. Simple linear relationships were also observed between ozone dose and protein leak into the airways over the early- and late-acute response time points. Together, these data highlight an underlying association between ozone dose and airway responses and indicate that an appropriately designed large-scale exposure study could investigate the question of an ozone threshold level for such endpoints. Some of the results of these studies have been reported previously in the form of an abstract.",5.3.3,Initiation of inflammation,0,0

We have previously reported the time-course of ozone-induced airway inflammation, demonstrating an early up-regulation of vascular endothelial adhesion molecules in bronchial mucosa at 1.5 hours, followed by a neutrophilic infiltration 6 hours after exposure to 0.2 ppm ozone. We hypothesized that the neutrophilic infiltration in the bronchial mucosa would reflect an early increase in bronchial epithelial expression of redox-sensitive transcription factors and kinases regulating neutrophil chemoattractant expression. To test this hypothesis, endobronchial biopsies were obtained from healthy human subjects (n = 11) 1.5 hours after 0.2 ppm of ozone and filtered air exposures (lasting for 2 hours) and stained for mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), transcription factors, and neutrophil chemoattractants. Total epithelial staining was quantified, as well as the extent of nuclear translocation. Contrary to expectation, ozone significantly suppressed total and nuclear expression of nuclear factor kappaB (NFkappaB) in bronchial epithelial cells (p = 0.02 and p = 0.003 respectively). Similarly, the total staining for phosphorylated C-jun was suppressed (p = 0.021). Expression of interleukin 8 (IL-8) in the bronchial epithelium was likewise decreased after ozone (p = 0.018), while GRO-alpha, ENA-78, C-fos, p-p38, p-JNK, and p-ERK stainings were unchanged.

The materials included expanded polystyrene, a natural rubber adhesive, cedar board, Japanese Cyprus board and silver fir board, as well as d-limonene, which is a known constituent of certain woods and cleaning products. The combination of ozone and either d-limonene, cedar board or cypress board produced sub-micron particles, with most of the increase occurring in the size range of 0.01-0.5 mu m diameter. This was not observed for the other materials. In the case of cedar board, the consequence of ozone exposure over an extended time interval was monitored. As the exposure time elapsed, the concentration of sub-micron particles moderately decreased. In the second set of experiments, unwaxed or waxed plastic tiles were placed in the 20 L chamber and exposed to ozone.

OMI HCHO columns for June-August 2006 are consistent with measurements from the earlier GOME satellite sensor (1996-2001) but OMI is 2-14% lower. The spatial distribution of OMI HCHO columns follows that of isoprene emission; anthropogenic hydrocarbon emissions are undetectable except in Houston. We develop updated relationships between HCHO columns and isoprene emission from a chemical transport model (GEOS-Chem), and use these to infer top-down constraints on isoprene emissions from the OMI data. We compare the OMI-derived emissions to a state-of-science bottom-up isoprene emission inventory (MEGAN) driven by two land cover databases, and use the results to optimize the MEGAN emission factors (EFs) for broadleaf trees (the main isoprene source). The OMI-derived isoprene emissions in North America (June-August 2006) with 1 degrees x 1 degrees resolution are spatially consistent with MEGAN (R-2 = 0.48-0.68) but are lower (by 4-25% on average). MEGAN overestimates emissions in the Ozarks and the Upper South. A better fit to OMI (R-2 = 0.73) is obtained in MEGAN by using a uniform isoprene EF from broadleaf trees rather than variable EFs. Thus MEGAN may overestimate emissions in areas where it specifies particularly high EFs. Within-canopy isoprene oxidation may also lead to significant differences between the effective isoprene emission to the atmosphere seen by OMI and the actual isoprene emission determined by MEGAN.",3.2.1,Sources of Precursors Involved in O3 Formation,0,0

This plume was sampled several times in the free troposphere over North America, the North Atlantic and Europe by three different aircraft during the IGAC Lagrangian 2K4 experiment which was part of the ICARTT/ ITOP measurement intensive in summer 2004. Measurements in the plume showed enhanced values of CO, VOCs and NOy, mainly in form of PAN. Observed O-3 levels increased by 17 ppbv over 5 days. A photochemical trajectory model, CiTTyCAT, was used to examine processes responsible for the chemical evolution of the plume. The model was initialized with upwind data and compared with downwind measurements. The influence of high aerosol loading on photolysis rates in the plume was investigated using in situ aerosol measurements in the plume and lidar retrievals of optical depth as input into a photolysis code (Fast-J), run in the model. Significant impacts on photochemistry are found with a decrease of 18% in O-3 production and 24% in O-3 destruction over 5 days when including aerosols. The plume is found to be chemically active with large O-3 increases attributed primarily to PAN decomposition during descent of the plume toward Europe. The predicted O-3 changes are very dependent on temperature changes during transport and also on water vapor levels in the lower troposphere which can lead to O-3 destruction. Simulation of mixing/dilution was necessary to reproduce observed pollutant levels in the plume. Mixing was simulated using background concentrations from measurements in air masses in close proximity to the plume, and mixing timescales ( averaging 6.25 days) were derived from CO changes. Observed and simulated O-3/CO correlations in the plume were also compared in order to evaluate the photochemistry in the model. Observed slopes change from negative to positive over 5 days. This change, which can be attributed largely to photochemistry, is well reproduced by multiple model runs even if slope values are slightly underestimated suggesting a small underestimation in modeled photochemical O-3 production. The possible impact of this biomass burning plume on O-3 levels in the European boundary layer was also examined by running the model for a further 5 days and comparing with data collected at surface sites, such as Jungfraujoch, which showed small O-3 increases and elevated CO levels. The model predicts significant changes in O-3 over the entire 10 day period due to photochemistry but the signal is largely lost because of the effects of dilution. However, measurements in several other BB plumes over Europe show that O-3 impact of Alaskan fires can be potentially significant over Europe.",3.4.3.2,Using Other Models to Estimate Background Concentrations,0,0

Several studies suggest that dietary intake of fruits and vegetables might modify the adverse effect of air pollutants. METHODS: A total of 158 asthmatic children recruited at the Children's Hospital of Mexico and 50 non-asthmatic children were followed for 22 weeks. Pulmonary function was measured and nasal lavage collected and analyzed every 2 weeks. Dietary intake was evaluated using a 108-item food frequency questionnaire and a fruit and vegetable index (FVI) and a Mediterranean diet index (MDI) were constructed. The impact of these indices on lung function and interleukin-8 (IL-8) and their interaction with air pollutants were determined using mixed regression models with random intercept and random slope. RESULTS: FVI was inversely related to IL-8 levels in nasal lavage (p < 0.02) with a significant inverse trend (test for trend p < 0.001), MDI was positively related to lung function (p < 0.05), and children in the highest category of MDI had a higher FEV1 (test for trend p < 0.12) and FVC (test for trend p < 0.06) than children in the lowest category. A significant interaction was observed between FVI and ozone for FEV1 and FVC as was with MDI and ozone for FVC. No effect of diet was observed among healthy children. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that fruit and vegetable intake and close adherence to the Mediterranean diet have a beneficial effect on inflammatory response and lung function in asthmatic children living in Mexico City.",6.2.1.2,Epidemiology,0,0

In the first study, a 225 km2 area was considered. Here, a randomized design was used to evaluate the variability of ozone concentration at 1 and 225 km2 scale. Measurements were carried out by passive samplers between May and June 2007. In a second study, the whole 6207 km2 area of Trentino was considered. The area is covered by five grid cells of the European Monitoring and Evaluation Programme (EMEP). A systematic 15 x 15 km grid was used to allocate 15 passive samplers over the entire province, resulting into 1-4 samplers for each of the 5 EMEP grid cells (2500 km2 each) overlapping the study area. Measurements were carried out between June and September 2007. Accuracy of passive samplers was checked by direct comparison with conventional ozone analysers. Significant differences (P = 0.034) were found in ozone concentration among 1 x 1 km quadrates within the 225 km2 study area, while variability within the 1A ??A 1A km grid cells (coefficient of variation, CV' = 0.12) slightly exceed the measurement error (CV' = 0.08). At larger scales (225, 2500 and 6207 km2), ozone concentration shows much higher variability (CV' from 0.18 to 0.28, with peak values at 0.40). Reported differences lead to very different AOT40 estimates even within the same EMEP grid cell. These findings suggest that 1 x 1 km resolution seems appropriate for ozone concentration modelling. On the other hand, significant sub-grid variation may exist at the resolution adopted by the EMEP model. Coupled with the likely variability of other important meteorological, soil and vegetation variables, our findings suggest that ozone risk assessment for vegetation based on large-scale modelled AOT40 and flux needs to be considered with great caution. The evidence reported in this paper asks for more detailed national-scale modelling, and the development of methods to incorporate local scale variations into large-scale models.",3.5.5.3,Passive Air Sampling Devices and Sensors,0,0

Previous studies have demonstrated associations of high ozone levels with increased epidemiologic as well as lung function measures of asthma activity. Objectives. In an observational study during the summer months, we hypothesized that higher ambient ozone levels are associated with more frequent symptoms, higher airway and systemic inflammation, as well as worse lung function in asthmatics as compared with non-asthmatic individuals. Methods. Thirty-eight asthmatics and thirteen healthy control subjects residing in metropolitan Atlanta were enrolled during peak ozone season. Medical histories, quality-of-life questionnaires, spirometry, serum immunoglobulin (IgE), peripheral eosinophil counts, and exhaled nitric oxide (NO) were obtained during study visits. Personal ozone exposures over the 2 days before presentation were estimated based on location and activity surveys. Main results. Upper airway symptoms were more frequent in asthmatics. Higher levels of ozone were associated with worse airflow obstruction, lower quality of life scores, greater eosinophilia, and higher exhaled NO levels in asthmatics. Finally, both asthmatics and non-asthmatics with allergies showed associations between air quality and airway inflammation. Conclusions: In adults with asthma but not controls studied during peak ozone season, increasing ozone exposure predicted lower lung function and increased biomarkers of respiratory and systemic inflammation. These associations were enhanced in atopic participants, both with and without asthma. Importantly, the study findings were noted while atmospheric ozone levels were predominantly within the current and revised national air quality standards.",6.2.1.2,Epidemiology,0,0

However, it is unknown whether this phenomenon is explained by an air pollution-mediated increase in respiratory symptom severity or whether air pollutants decrease the efficacy of short-acting ?-agonists (SABAs).

Methods:  We examined the relationship between the percentage change in FEV1 after SABA use with outdoor air pollution exposure in 85 children with asthma who were 7 to 12 years of age. Outdoor air pollution exposure was determined by measuring nitrogen dioxide (NO2), ozone (O3), and fine particulate matter (ie, particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter < 2.5 ?m [PM2.5]) levels. These measurements were obtained from the Mexico City Automated Monitoring Network from network sites located within a 5-km radius of each child's home and school.

Results:  We found that a same-day interquartile increase of 10 parts per billion (ppb) in NO2 concentration was associated with a reduced response of FEV1 to SABA therapy (?15%; 95% CI, ?29 to ?0.5). This association was also significant when considering NO2 levels in each of the preceding 3 days. An interquartile O3 increase (16 ppb) in the preceding fifth day was associated with a reduced response to SABA (?11%; 95% CI, ?23 to ?1); an interquartile PM2.5 increase (14 ?g/m3) was not associated with any significant reductions in the response to SABA therapy. These associations were not observed in children receiving therapy with inhaled corticosteroids.

Conclusions:  Our results suggest that recent exposure to NO2 and possibly O3 may reduce the response to SABAs in producing bronchodilation in children with asthma. The association between NO2 and FEV1 response to SABA administration may have important implications in understanding how outdoor air pollution levels relate to asthma control.",6.2.1.2,Epidemiology,0,0

After night time formation and accumulation up to 2 ppb HNO2 were observed. The measurements confirm that during the first hours after sunrise, when hydroxyl radical (OH) production rates from other sources (photolysis of ozone and formaldehyde (HCHO)) are slow, HNO2 photolysis is the most important primary OH source in the lowest part of the troposphere; up to 1-4 x 107 OH cm-3 s-1 were estimated for that time from this source.

Excellent agreement of two separate open path DOAS measurements at one location indicated that spatial and temporal inhomogeneities were not substantially influencing comparisons of the point sampling and open path instruments.

However, indigo carmine is strongly affected by UV light, thus making the papers unsuitable for outdoor ozone detection. The authors succeeded in sufficiently improving the resistance of the papers to UV light for them to be used outdoors. This was achieved by using hydrophilic UVAs, namely sodium 2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzophenone-5-sulfonate and ferulic acid. Without a UVA, the maximum measurement error of the papers derived from UV effect is approximately 290 parts per billion (ppb) x hr when one assumes 8 hr of UV exposure at low- to mid-latitudes (approximately 60 Wh/m2), and this error is too great for accurate ozone measurement.

The plate transmittance is probed by three discrete light emitting diodes (LEDs) centered, respectively, at 442, 525, and 850 nm. The transmission of the plate changes reversibly across visible to NIR wavelengths as the RH around the plate changes; this is the basis for a limited-resolution RH sensor. The ANS on the plate reacts to form brown and pink colored products, respectively, when it reacts with NO2 and O3. The sample air impinges on the plate via an entrance nozzle. The LEDs are alternately turned on in a preprogrammed manner and the light is brought to the impregnated face of the plate by a three-legged fiber optic. The transmitted light is detected on the obverse side of the plate. The 850 nm signal provides the RH value and optionally serves as the reference measurement for the other two wavelengths; the NO2 and O3 reaction products do not absorb at this wavelength.

However, measurement of HONO is problematic, with most in-situ techniques reporting higher values than simultaneous optical measurements by long-path DOAS, especially during daytime. The discrepancy has been attributed to positive interference in the in-situ techniques, negative interference in DOAS retrievals, the difficulty of comparing the different air masses sampled by the methods, or combinations of these.

These techniques include ultraviolet absorption photometry of O3 at the 253.7-nm Hg line and gas-phase titration of O3 with excess NO. For ultraviolet photometry, a well-designed and maintained standard reference photometer (SRP) built by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (USA) was employed. For gas-phase titration (GPT), an existing system was significantly modified by the National Institute for Environmental Studies (Japan) by using gravimetric NO/N2 standard gases, accurate flow measurement systems based on laminar flow elements, and two chemiluminescence NO detectors to minimize uncertainty in the measurements, which had previously been a major shortcoming of this method. Uncertainty in the improved GPT system was reduced to less than 0.4% above 100 nmol mol?1 O3 mole fraction. A series of comparison runs between the two methods over the course of 13 months from August 2004 to August 2005 showed a significant discrepancy, which cannot be explained by the measurement uncertainties attributed to either SRP or GPT in the range of 80?800 nmol mol?1 O3, where GPT was about 2% higher than SRP. This result indicates possible biases in the currently existing O3 reference standards and warrants further studies to identify and characterize possible sources of the systematic discrepancy.",3.5.4,Monitor Calibration,0,0

The filling of oxygen vacancies by the decomposing ozone traps free charge carriers with consequent measurable increase in resistance. A Langmuir-type model simulating the fundamental surface reactions has been found to reproduce the measured sensor response. Using a temperature-cycling technique in which the temperature of the sensor is alternated between 600 and 530 ?C representing scrubbing and measurement resistances, respectively, ozone measurements have been obtained from several urban sites. Results from eight sensors show that the sensors have adequate sensitivity and response time with measurements comparable to ozone measured by UV absorption spectrometer (r.m.s. of variances up to 7 ppbv). Problems of apparent changes in sensor sensitivity in the course of field measurements have been explained by inadequate `burn-in? period prior to calibration and field deployment.

In addition, NOX and O3 passive diffusion tubes have been developed and deployed in urban and rural areas. Despite their many advantages (e.g. low operational and analysis cost, small size and no need for power supply), they have certain limitations mainly related to their accuracy and precision. In particular, the absorbent solution used, the length of the exposure period, the exact location and use of protective devices, and other environmental conditions (e.g. wind, ambient temperature and relative humidity) may have a significant impact on the performance of passive diffusion tubes. The aim of this study is to evaluate the performance of co-located NO2, NOX and O3 diffusion tubes in an urban environment.

A one-year passive sampling campaign was carried out in Birmingham (UK) for this purpose. NO2, NOX and O3 diffusion tubes (including triplicate sets of each) were co-located at one urban background and two roadside permanent air quality monitoring stations equipped with standard gas analysers. In addition, meteorological data, such as wind speed and direction, ambient temperature and relative humidity, were obtained during the same period of time. A thorough QA/QC procedure, including storage and laboratory blanks was followed throughout the campaign. The analysis of results showed a very good agreement of NO2 passive samplers with co-located chemiluminescence analysers, but substantial underestimations of total NOX levels by the diffusion tubes.

Considering that water vapor does not absorb at the wavelength of the Hg lamp (253.7 nm) used in these instruments, another explanation is required. Based on experimental evidence and theoretical considerations, we conclude that the water vapor interference is caused by humidity effects on the transmission of uncollimated UV light through the detection cell. The ozone scrubber acts as a water reservoir, either adding or removing water from the air sample, thereby modulating the detector signal and producing a positive or negative offset. It was found for the 2B Technologies ozone monitor that use of a 1-m length of Nafion tubing just prior to the entrance to the detection cell reduces the water vapor interference to negligible levels (+/- 2 ppbv for step changes between 0 and 90% RH) while quantitatively passing ozone.",3.5.1,Routine Monitoring Techniques,0,0

We previously determined that mice genetically deficient in TNF response are protected from lung inflammation and epithelial injury after O(3) exposure. OBJECTIVES: The present study was designed to determine the molecular mechanisms of TNF receptor (TNF-R)-mediated lung injury induced by O(3). 

METHODS: TNF-R knockout (Tnfr(-/-)) and wild-type (Tnfr(+/+)) mice were exposed to 0.3 ppm O(3) or air (for 6, 24, or 48 h), and lung RNA and proteins were prepared. Mice deficient in p50 nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB (Nfkb1(-/-)) or c-Jun-NH(2) terminal kinase 1 (Jnk1(-/-)) and wild-type controls (Nfkb1(+/+), Jnk1(+/+)) were exposed to O(3) (48 h), and the role of NF-kappaB and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) as downstream effectors of lung injury was analyzed by bronchoalveolar lavage analyses. 

RESULTS: O(3)-induced early activation of TNF-R adaptor complex formation was attenuated in Tnfr(-/-) mice compared with Tnfr(+/+) mice. O(3) significantly activated lung NF-kappaB in Tnfr(+/+) mice before the development of lung injury. Basal and O(3)-induced NF-kappaB activity was suppressed in Tnfr(-/-) mice. Compared with Tnfr(+/+) mice, MAPKs and activator protein (AP)-1 were lower in Tnfr(-/-) mice basally and after O(3). Furthermore, inflammatory cytokines, including macrophage inflammatory protein-2, were differentially expressed in Tnfr(-/-) and Tnfr(+/+) mice after O(3). O(3)-induced lung injury was significantly reduced in Nfkb1(-/-) and Jnk1(-/-) mice relative to respective control animals.

Once released into the atmosphere, 1,3-butadiene (BD) reacts with hydroxyl radicals and ozone (created by photochemical processes), to produce many identified and unidentified products. Once this transformation has occurred, the toxic potential of atmospheric pollutants such as BD in the ambient environment is currently unclear. During this study, environmental irradiation chambers (also called smog chambers), utilizing natural sunlight, were used to create photochemical transformations of BD. The smog chamber/in vitro exposure system was designed to investigate the toxicity of chemicals before and after photochemical reactions and to investigate interactions with the urban atmosphere using representative in vitro samples. In this study, we determined the relative toxicity and inflammatory gene expression induced by coupling smog chamber atmospheres with an in vitro system to expose human respiratory epithelial cells to BD, BDs photochemical degradation products, or the equivalent ozone generated within the photochemical mixture. Exposure to the photochemically generated products of BD (primarily acrolein, acetaldehyde, formaldehyde, furan and ozone) induced significant increases in cytotoxicity, IL-8, and IL-6 gene expression compared to a synthetic mixture of primary products that was created by injecting the correct concentrations of the detected products from the irradiation experiments. Interestingly, exposure to the equivalent levels of ozone generated during the photochemical transformation of BD did not induce the same level of inflammatory cytokine release for either exposure protocol, suggesting that the effects from ozone alone do not account for the entire response in the irradiation experiments. These results indicate that BDs full photochemical product generation and interactions, rather than ozone alone, must be carefully evaluated when investigating the possible adverse health effects to BD exposures. The research presented here takes into account that photochemical transformations of hazardous air pollutants (HAPs) does generate a dynamic exposure system and therefore provides a more realistic approach to estimate the toxicity of ambient air pollutants once they are released into the atmosphere.",3.2.2,Gas Phase Reactions Leading to O3 Formation,0,0

OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to determine if these remodelling changes were reversible after 6 months of recovery. METHODS: Rhesus monkeys were exposed to a regimen of HDMA and or O3 or filtered air (FA) for 6 months. After the exposure protocol was completed FA and O3 groups were allowed to recover in FA for 6 months. The HDMA and HDMA+O3 exposure groups recovered in a modified environment.

In the present study, data showed that O3 exposure could impair both the natural killer (NK) cell activity and the proliferation potential of spleen T cells to a specific antigen stimulus. Immunological function assays indicated that O3 exposure attenuated the proliferation of spleen mononuclear cells induced by concanavalin A and decreased CD4+ and CD28+ lymphocyte subsets. However, supplementation with natural antioxidants protected mice from O3-induced dysfunction of splenocyte proliferation. Meanwhile, O3 exposure resulted in a decline of mitogen-induced IL-2 production in splenocytes.

The ability of 17beta-estradiol to prevent these effects was then assessed. Results showed that ozone exposure for 30 or 60 days impaired formation/retention of a selective olfactory recognition memory 120 min after exposure to a juvenile stimulus animal with the effect at 60 days being significantly greater than at 30 days. They also showed impaired speed in locating a buried chocolate reward after 60 days of ozone exposure indicating some loss of olfactory perception. These functional impairments could all be prevented by coincident estradiol treatment. In the olfactory bulb, levels of lipid peroxidation were increased at both 30- and 60-day time-points and numbers of cells with immunohistochemical staining for alpha and beta estrogen receptors, and dopamine beta-hydroxylase were reduced as were alpha and beta estrogen receptor protein levels. These effects were prevented by estradiol treatment. Oxidative stress damage caused by chronic exposure to ozone does therefore impair olfactory perception and social recognition memory and may do so by reducing noradrenergic and estrogen receptor activity in the olfactory bulb.

Several studies have investigated the role of copollutants, such as ozone (O(3)), in this association.

We hypothesize that adaptation to PM and O(3) varies among different inbred mouse strains, and cardiopulmonary adaptation to O(3) is a synchronized response between the cardiac and respiratory systems. Heart rate (HR), HR variability (HRV), and the magnitude and pattern of breathing were simultaneously measured by implanted telemeters and by plethysmography in three inbred mouse strains: C57Bl/6J (B6), C3H/HeJ (HeJ), and C3H/HeOuJ (OuJ). Physiological responses were assessed during dual exposures to filtered air (FA), O(3) (576 +/- 32 parts/billion), and/or carbon black (CB; 556 +/- 34 mug/m(3)). Exposures were repeated for 3 consecutive days. While each strain showed significant reductions in HR during CB with O(3) preexposure (O(3)CB) on day 1, prominent HRV responses were observed in only HeJ and OuJ mice. Each strain also differed in their adaptation profile in response to repeated O(3)CB exposures. Whereas B6 mice showed rapid adaptation in HR after day 1, HeJ mice generally showed more moderate HR and HRV adaptation after day 2 of exposure. Unlike either B6 or HeJ strains, OuJ mice showed little evidence of HR or HRV adaptation to repeated O(3)CB exposure. Adaptation profiles between HR regulation and breathing characteristics were strongly correlated, but these associations also varied significantly among strains. These findings suggest that genetic factors determine the responsivity and adaptation of the cardiac and respiratory systems to repeated copollutant exposures.

Ozone by itself produced minimal effects, but in CNT-exposed animals there was a significant increase in total brochoalveolar lavage (BAL) cells and polymorphonuclear leukocytes. Additionally, protein, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, interleukin (IL)-1beta, and mucin levels in BALF at 5 and 24 h were higher in CNT-exposed animals than in corresponding air-exposed controls or animals exposed to O3 alone. A comparable increase over the controls was also observed in the CNT/O3 group, but neither an additive nor a synergistic interaction was observed in mice that received sequential exposure to CNT and ozone. In fact, some CNT-induced cytotoxic/inflammatory responses were attenuated in mice following exposure to both CNT and low levels of ozone. These results are contrary to enhanced responses that were anticipated and may represent the development of ""cross-tolerance"" reported by others for some sequentially administered pollutants.",5.4.2.6,Co exposures with Particulate Matter,0,0

We evaluated whether bronchi and respiratory bronchioles from infant monkeys exposed episodically to allergen and/or ozone differentially develop intrinsic hyperresponsiveness to methacholine and whether eosinophils and/or pulmonary neuroendocrine cells play a role. Infant monkeys were exposed episodically for 5 months to: (1) filtered air, (2) aerosolized house dust mite allergen, (3) ozone 0.5 ppm, or (4) house dust mite allergen + ozone. Studying the function/structure relationship of the same lung slices, we evaluated methacholine airway responsiveness and histology of bronchi and respiratory bronchioles. In bronchi, intrinsic responsiveness was increased by allergen exposure, an effect reduced by bombesin antagonist. In respiratory bronchioles, intrinsic airway responsiveness was increased by allergen + ozone exposure. Eosinophils were increased by allergen and allergen + ozone exposure in bronchi and by allergen exposure in respiratory bronchioles. In both airways, exposure to allergen + ozone resulted in fewer tissue eosinophils than did allergen exposure alone. In bronchi, but not in respiratory bronchioles, the number of eosinophils and neuroendocrine cells correlated with airway responsiveness. We conclude that episodically exposing infant monkeys to house dust mite allergen with or without ozone increased intrinsic airway responsiveness to methacholine in bronchi differently than in respiratory bronchioles.

In mice, the neutrophil chemokines KC and macrophage inflammatory protein-2 (MIP-2) are expressed in the lungs following O(3) exposure. The purpose of this study was to determine whether CXCR2, the receptor for these chemokines, is essential to O(3)-induced neutrophil recruitment, injury to lungs, and increases in respiratory system responsiveness to methacholine (MCh). O(3) exposure (1 ppm for 3 h) increased the number of neutrophils in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) of wild-type (BALB/c) and CXCR2-deficient mice. However, CXCR2-deficient mice had significantly fewer emigrated neutrophils than did wild-type mice. The numbers of neutrophils in the blood and concentrations of BALF KC and MIP-2 did not differ between genotypes. Together, these data suggest CXCR2 is essential for maximal chemokine-directed migration of neutrophils to the air spaces. In wild-type mice, O(3) exposure increased BALF epithelial cell numbers and total protein levels, two indirect measures of lung injury. In contrast, in CXCR2-deficient mice, the number of BALF epithelial cells was not increased by O(3) exposure. Responses to inhaled MCh were measured by whole body plethysmography using enhanced pause as the outcome indicator. O(3) exposure increased responses to inhaled MCh in both wild-type and CXCR2-deficient mice 3 h after O(3) exposure. However, at 24 h after exposure, responses to inhaled MCh were elevated in wild-type but not CXCR2-deficient mice.

SP-A1 and SP-A2 encode human (h) SP-A; SP-A2 products enhance phagocytosis more than SP-A1. Oxidation can affect SP-A function. We hypothesized that in vivo and in vitro ozone-induced oxidation of SP-A (as assessed by its carbonylation level) negatively affects its function in phagocytosis (as assessed by bacteria cell association). To test this, we used P. aeruginosa, rat alveolar macrophages (AMs), hSP-As with varying levels of in vivo (natural) oxidation, and ozone-exposed SP-A2 (1A, 1A0) and SP-A1 (6A2, 6A4) variants. SP-A oxidation levels (carbonylation) were measured; AMs were incubated with bacteria in the presence of SP-A, and the phagocytic index was calculated. We found: 1) the phagocytic activity of hSP-A is reduced with increasing levels of in vivo SP-A carbonylation; 2) in vitro ozone exposure of hSP-A decreases its function in a dose-dependent manner as well as its ability to enhance phagocytosis of either gram-negative or gram-positive bacteria; 3) the activity of both SP-A1 and SP-A2 decreases in response to in vitro ozone exposure of proteins with SP-A2 being affected more than SP-A1. We conclude that both in vivo and in vitro oxidative modifications of SP-A by carbonylation reduce its ability to enhance phagocytosis of bacteria and that the activity of SP-A2 is affected more by in vitro ozone-induced oxidation.

Although ozone-induced asthma is characterized by airway neutrophilia, and not eosinophilia, it is nevertheless associated with airway hyperreactivity (AHR), which is a cardinal feature of asthma. Because AHR induced by allergens requires the presence of natural killer T (NKT) cells, we asked whether ozone-induced AHR had similar requirements. We found that repeated exposure of wild-type (WT) mice to ozone induced severe AHR associated with an increase in airway NKT cells, neutrophils, and macrophages. Surprisingly, NKT cell-deficient (CD1d(-/-) and Jalpha18(-/-)) mice failed to develop ozone-induced AHR. Further, treatment of WT mice with an anti-CD1d mAb blocked NKT cell activation and prevented ozone-induced AHR. Moreover, ozone-induced, but not allergen-induced, AHR was associated with NKT cells producing interleukin (IL)-17, and failed to occur in IL-17(-/-) mice nor in WT mice treated with anti-IL-17 mAb. Thus, ozone exposure induces AHR that requires the presence of NKT cells and IL-17 production. Because NKT cells are required for the development of two very disparate forms of AHR (ozone- and allergen-induced), our results strongly suggest that NKT cells mediate a unifying pathogenic mechanism for several distinct forms of asthma, and represent a unique target for effective asthma therapy.",5.3.6,Modification of Innate/Adaptive Immune System Responses,0,0

An early inflammatory response induced by inhaled O(3) is characterized primarily by release of inflammatory mediators such as cytokines, chemokines, and airway neutrophil accumulation. Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) have been implicated in the pathogenesis of oxidative lung disorders including acute lung injury, asthma, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. OBJECTIVE: We hypothesized that MMPs have an important role in the pathogenesis of O(3)-induced airway inflammation. METHODS: We compared the lung injury responses in either Mmp7- (Mmp7(-/-)) or Mmp9-deficient (Mmp9(-/-)) mice and their wild-type controls (Mmp7(+/+), Mmp9(+/+)) after exposure to 0.3 ppm O(3) or filtered air. RESULTS: Relative to air-exposed controls, MMP-9 activity in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) was significantly increased by O(3) exposure in Mmp9(+/+) mice. O(3)-induced increases in the concentration of total protein (a marker of lung permeability) and the numbers of neutrophils and epithelial cells in BALF were significantly greater in Mmp9(-/-) mice compared with Mmp9(+/+) mice. Keratinocyte-derived chemokine (KC) and macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)-2 levels in BALF were also significantly higher in Mmp9(-/-) mice than in Mmp9(+/+) mice after O(3) exposure, although no differences in mRNA expression for these chemokines were found between genotypes. Mean BALF protein concentration and numbers of inflammatory cells were not significantly different between Mmp7(+/+) and Mmp7(-/-) mice after O(3) exposure. CONCLUSIONS: Results demonstrated a protective role of MMP-9 but not of MMP-7, in O(3)-induced lung neutrophilic inflammation and hyperpermeability.

Methods: Male and female C57BL/6 mice were exposed to O3 or to filtered air (FA) (control) and
then infected intratracheally with K. pneumoniae bacteria. Survival was monitored over a 14-day

We determined the importance of c-Jun NH2 terminal kinase (JNK), a member of the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway, in ozone-induced AHR and inflammation. SP600125 [anthra[1,9-cd] pyrazol-6 (2H)-one], a specific JNK inhibitor (30 mg/kg) or vehicle, was administered by intraperitoneal injection before and after ozone exposure (3 ppm for 3 h). SP600125 significantly reduced total cells, and neutrophils in bronchoalveolar fluid recovered at 20 to 24 h after exposure and inhibited ozone-induced AHR. Ozone exposure induced activation of JNK in the lung as measured by the expression of phosphorylated-c-Jun, an effect abolished by SP600125. Gene-microarray analysis revealed that ozone increased the expression of over 400 genes by more than 2-fold, including interleukin-6 (IL-6), CXCL1 (keratinocyte cytokine), and CCL2 (monocyte chemoattractant protein-1). SP600125 modulated the expression of a subset of 29 ozone-induced genes; IL-6 and CCL2 expression were further increased, whereas the expression of metallothionein 1, hemopexin, and mitogen-activated 3 kinase 6 was decreased in SP600125-treated ozone-exposed mice. Changes in mRNA for IL-6, CXCL1, and CCL2 were confirmed by real-time polymerase chain reaction. Ozone also decreased the expression of over 500 genes, with the most potent effect on angiopoietin-1. SP600125 modulated the expression of 15 of these genes, and in particular, SP600125 reversed ozone-induced decrease in expression of the redox-sensitive transcription factor, hypoxia-induced factor-1?. This study highlights an important role for JNK in response to oxidative stress through modulation of specific inflammatory and redox mediators.

We investigated the sensing of ozone by TLR2, TLR4, and MyD88. Ozone induced AHR in wild-type (WT) C57BL/6 mice, but AHR was absent in TLR2?/?, TLR4?/?, and MyD88?/? mice. Bronchoalveolar lavage neutrophilia induced by ozone was inhibited at 3 h but not at 24 h in TLR2?/? and TLR4?/? mice, while in MyD88?/? mice, this was inhibited at 24 h.

Our recent studies showed that interleukin (IL)-1, an important multifunctional proinflammatory cytokine, increases synthesis and release of SP from intrinsic airway neurons. The purpose of this study is to investigate the possible involvement of endogenous IL-1 in modulating neural responses associated with ozone-enhanced airway responsiveness. Ferrets were exposed to 2 ppm ozone or filtered air for 3 h. IL-1 in the bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid was significantly increased in ozone-exposed animals and responses of tracheal smooth muscle to methacholine (MCh) and electrical field stimulation (EFS) were elevated significantly. Both the SP nerve fiber density in tracheal smooth muscle and the number of SP-containing neurons in airway ganglia were significantly increased following ozone exposure. Pretreatment with IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1 Ra) significantly diminished ozone-enhanced airway responses to EFS as well as ozone-increased SP in the airway. To selectively investigate intrinsic airway neurons, segments of ferret trachea were maintained in culture conditions for 24 h to eliminate extrinsic contributions from sensory nerves. The segments were then exposed to 2 ppm ozone in vitro for 3 h. The changes of ozone-induced airway responses to MCh and EFS, and the SP levels in airway neurons paralleled those observed with in vivo ozone exposure. The ozone-enhanced airway responses and neuronal SP levels were inhibited by pretreatment with IL-1 Ra.

Because eosinophil populations in the lungs fluctuate following ozone, the contribution of eosinophils to M2 dysfunction and airway hyperreactivity was measured over several days. After one exposure to ozone, M2 function, vagal reactivity, smooth muscle responsiveness, and inflammation were measured in anesthetized guinea pigs. Ozone-induced hyperreactivity to vagal stimulation persisted over 3 days. Although hyperreactivity one day after ozone is mediated by eosinophils, AbVLA-4 did not inhibit either eosinophil accumulation in the lungs or around the nerves or prevent hyperreactivity at this time point. Two days after ozone, eosinophils in BAL, around airway nerves and in lungs, were decreased, and neuronal M2 receptor function was normal, although animals were still hyperreactive to vagal stimulation. Depleting eosinophils with AbIL-5 prevented hyperreactivity, thus eosinophils contribute to vagal hyperreactivity by mechanisms separate from M2 receptor blockade. Three days after ozone, vagal hyperreactivity persisted, eosinophils were again elevated in BAL in lungs and around nerves, and M2 receptors were again dysfunctional. At this point, airway smooth muscle was also hyperresponsive to methacholine. Eosinophil depletion with AbIL-5, AbVLA-4, or cyclophosphamide protected M2 function 3 days after ozone and prevented smooth muscle hyperreactivity. However, vagal hyperreactivity was significantly potentiated by eosinophil depletion. The site of hyperreactivity, muscle or nerve, changes over 3 days after a single exposure to ozone. Additionally, the role of eosinophils is complex; they mediate hyperreactivity acutely while chronically may be involved in repair.",5.3.5,Sensitization of Bronchial Smooth Muscle,0,0

The mechanisms, which regulate ozone-induced bronchoconstriction, remain poorly understood. Hyaluronan was recently shown to play a central role in the response to noninfectious lung injury. Therefore, we hypothesized that hyaluronan contributes to airway hyperreactivity (AHR) after exposure to ambient ozone. Using an established model of ozone-induced airways disease, we characterized the role of hyaluronan in airway hyperresponsiveness. The role of hyaluronan in response to ozone was determined by using therapeutic blockade, genetically modified animals, and direct challenge to hyaluronan. Ozone-exposed mice demonstrate enhanced AHR associated with elevated hyaluronan levels in the lavage fluid. Mice deficient in either CD44 (the major receptor for hyaluronan) or inter-alpha-trypsin inhibitor (molecule that facilitates hyaluronan binding) show similar elevations in hyaluronan but are protected from ozone-induced AHR. Mice pretreated with hyaluronan-binding peptide are protected from the development of ozone-induced AHR. Overexpression of hyaluronan enhances the airway response to ozone. Intratracheal instillation of endotoxin-free low molecular weight hyaluronan induces AHR dependent on CD44, whereas instillation of high molecular weight hyaluronan protects against ozone-induced AHR. In conclusion, we demonstrate that hyaluronan mediates ozone-induced AHR, which is dependent on the fragment size and both CD44 and inter-alpha-trypsin inhibitor.

Lungs were subject to bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) or used to measure endpoints of oxidative stress and inflammation. Despite more total protein in BAL of KO mice after a 3 h ozone exposure, WT mice had increased oxidation of protein and had oxidized SP-A dimers. In KO mice there was epithelial damage as assessed by increased LDH activity and there was increased phospholipid content. In WT mice there were more BAL PMNs and elevated macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)-2 and monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP)-1. Changes in MIP-2 and MCP-1 were observed in both KO and WT, however mRNA levels differed. In KO mice MIP-2 mRNA levels changed little with ozone, but in WT levels they were significantly increased.

Pre-exposure to ozone resulted in enhanced airway hyperreactivity, higher concentrations of both total protein and proinflammatory cytokines in lung lavage fluid, enhanced LPS-mediated signaling in lung tissue, and higher concentrations of serum IL-6 following inhalation of LPS. However, pre-exposure to ozone dramatically reduced inflammatory cell accumulation to the lower airways in response to inhaled LPS. The reduced concentration of cells in the lower airways was associated with enhanced apoptosis of both lung macrophages and systemic circulating monocytes.

Methods: We compared the validity of ordinary kriging, universal kriging and regression mapping in developing EU-wide maps of air pollution on a I x 1 km resolution. Predictions were made for the year 2001 for nitrogen dioxide (NO2), fine particles <10 mu m (PM10), ozone (O-3), sulphur dioxide (SO2) and carbon monoxide (CO) using routine monitoring data in Airbase. Predictor variables from EU-wide databases were land use, road traffic, population density, meteorology, altitude, topography and distance to sea. Models were developed for the global, rural and urban scale separately. The best method to model concentrations was selected on the basis of predefined performance measures (R-2, Root Mean Square Error (RMSE)). Results: For NO2, PM10 and O-3 universal kriging performed better than regression mapping and ordinary kriging. Validation of the final universal kriging estimates with results from all validation sites gave e-values and RMSE-values of 0.61 and 6.73 mu g/m(3) for NO2; 0.45 and 5.19 mu g/m(3) for PM10; and 0.70 and 7.69 mu g/m(3) for O-3.

In this study, experiments were performed that used either particle production or ozone removal as probes to further improve our understanding of such processes. The measured ratio of downstream to upstream submicron particle concentrations increased when ozone was added to air passing through samples from loaded particle filters. Such an observation is consistent with low volatility oxidation products desorbing from the filter and subsequently partitioning between the gas phase and the surface of particles that have passed through the filter, including particles that were previously too small (&lt; 20 nm) to be detected by the instrument used in these studies. A related set of experiments conducted with unused filters and filters that had been in service from 2 to 16 weeks found that ozone removal efficiencies changed in a manner that indicated at least two different removal mechanisms-reactions with compounds present on the filter media following manufacturing and reactions with compounds associated with captured particles. The contribution from the former varies with the type and manufacturer of the filter, while that of the latter varies with the duration of service and nature of the captured particles. In complimentary experiments, a filter sample protected from ozone during its 9 weeks of service had higher ozone removal efficiencies than an identical filter not protected from ozone during the same 9 weeks of service filtering the same air. This result indicates that a filter's exposure history subsequently influences the quantity of oxidation products generated when ozone-containing air flows through it. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Traditionally, the model-predicted pollutant concentrations are evaluated for the ""base case"" to assess a model's ability to reproduce past observations. Dynamic evaluation aroaches, which evaluate a model's ability to accurately simulate air quality changes from given changes in emissions, are critically important to regulatory applications. Here, we investigate approaches to evaluate the Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) model's predicted ozone (O-3) response to large NO, emission reductions associated with the NO, State Implementation Plan (SIP) Call and on-road mobile emissions. This case has the advantages that emission changes associated with the NO, SIP Call can be well characterized and substantial changes are observed in O-3 levels. To consider the modeled response to emission changes in light of the strong meteorological influences on O-3, two time periods after the NO, SIP Call are included with very different meteorological conditions. The sensitivity to chemical mechanisms is also considered by including simulations with the CB4, SAPRC, and CB05 chemical mechanisms. The evaluation results suggest that the air quality model predictions underestimate the 03 reductions observed after the NO, SIP Call was implemented. While the emission estimate uncertainties may also be a factor, the results suggest that the contribution of long-range transport Of O-3 and precursors is underpredicted, especially when using the CB4 chemical mechanism. Further investigation of the chemical mechanisms' ability to characterize tropospheric chemistry aloft is recommended.

Estimates of the above-canopy fluxes are needed for quantitative earth system studies and assessments of past, present and future air quality and climate. The Model of Emissions of Gases and Aerosols from Nature (MEGAN) is described and used to quantify net terrestrial biosphere emission of isoprene into the atmosphere. MEGAN is designed for both global and regional emission modeling and has global coverage with ~1 km2 spatial resolution. Field and laboratory investigations of the processes controlling isoprene emission are described and data available for model development and evaluation are summarized. The factors controlling isoprene emissions include biological, physical and chemical driving variables. MEGAN driving variables are derived from models and satellite and ground observations. Tropical broadleaf trees contribute almost half of the estimated global annual isoprene emission due to their relatively high emission factors and because they are often exposed to conditions that are conducive for isoprene emission. The remaining flux is primarily from shrubs which have a widespread distribution. The annual global isoprene emission estimated with MEGAN ranges from about 500 to 750 Tg isoprene (440 to 660 Tg carbon) depending on the driving variables which include temperature, solar radiation, Leaf Area Index, and plant functional type. The global annual isoprene emission estimated using the standard driving variables is ~600 Tg isoprene. Differences in driving variables result in emission estimates that differ by more than a factor of three for specific times and locations. It is difficult to evaluate isoprene emission estimates using the concentration distributions simulated using chemistry and transport models, due to the substantial uncertainties in other model components, but at least some global models produce reasonable results when using isoprene emission distributions similar to MEGAN estimates. In addition, comparison with isoprene emissions estimated from satellite formaldehyde observations indicates reasonable agreement. The sensitivity of isoprene emissions to earth system changes (e.g., climate and land-use) demonstrates the potential for large future changes in emissions. Using temperature distributions simulated by global climate models for year 2100, MEGAN estimates that isoprene emissions increase by more than a factor of two. This is considerably greater than previous estimates and additional observations are needed to evaluate and improve the methods used to predict future isoprene emissions.",3.2.1,Sources of Precursors Involved in O3 Formation,0,0

The sigmoidally shaped model is continuous, does not require the identification of a population threshold concentration, and deals with plateau considerations at the high end of the distribution of exposures. For developing a consistent standard to protect human health, it is important to identify those ambient-type concentration patterns that elicit adverse human health effects. Such a standard should be ultimately based not only on spirometric response but other potentially important health impairment endpoints. Because of the paucity of experimental results that utilize ambient-type concentration regimes, additional studies are needed to create a database that uses realistic ambient-type exposures (i.e., variable concentration regimes) for human laboratory studies. The ambient-type concentration patterns that elicit an adverse health effect can be subsequently integrated into a form and level of a protective standard.

The importance of OH rests on its high reactivity, its ubiquitous photochemical production in the sunlit atmosphere, and most importantly on its regeneration in the oxidation chain of the trace gases. In the current understanding, the recycling of OH proceeds through HO2 reacting with NO, thereby forming ozone. A recent field campaign in the Pearl River Delta, China, quantified tropospheric OH and HO2 concentrations and turnover rates by direct measurements. We report that concentrations of OH were three to five times greater than expected, and we propose the existence of a pathway for the regeneration of OH independent of NO, which amplifies the degradation of pollutants without producing ozone.

To evaluate this hypothesis we used a gridded database of western U.S. summer burned area (BA) and biomass consumed (BC) by fires between 101-125 degrees W. The fire data were compared with daytime summer O-3 mixing ratios from nine rural Clean Air Status and Trends Network (CASTNET) and National Park Service (NPS) sites. Large fire years exhibited widespread enhanced O-3. The summer BA was significantly correlated with O-3 at all sites. For each 1 million acres burned in the western U.S. during summer, we estimate that the daytime mean O-3 was enhanced across the region by 2.0 ppbv. For mean and maximum fire years, O-3 was enhanced by an average of 3.5 and 8.8 ppbv, respectively. At most Sites O-3 was significantly correlated with fires in the surrounding 5 x 5 degrees and 10 x 10 degrees regions, but not with fires in the nearest 1 x 1 degrees region, reflecting the balance between O-3 production and destruction in a high NOx environment. BC was a slightly better predictor of O-3, compared with BA. The relationship between O-3 and temperature was examined at two sites (Yellowstone and Rocky Mountain National Parks). At these two sites, high fire years were significantly warmer than low fire years; however, daytime seasonal mean temperature and O-3 were not significantly correlated. This indicates that the presence of fire is a more important predictor for O-3 than is temperature.",3.2.4,Temperature and Chemical Precursor Relationships,0,0

Using the trending results, the analyses quantitatively explore the evidence for the higher hourly average O-3 concentrations decreasing faster than the mid- and lower-values. Most of the monitoring sites analyzed in our study experienced decreasing or no trends. Few monitoring sites experienced increasing trends. For those monitoring sites with declining O-3 levels, an initial pattern of rapid decrease in the higher hourly average concentrations, followed by a much slower decrease in mid-level concentrations was observed. In some cases, we observed shifts from the lower hourly average O-3 concentrations to the mid-level values. On a site-by-site basis, the majority of monitoring sites (1) changed from negative trend to no trend, (2) continued a negative trend, or (3) remained in the no trend status, when comparing trends for the 1980-2005 to the 1990-2005 time periods. For all three exposure metrics, approximately 60% of the monitoring sites shifted from negative trending to no trending status. It appeared that all regions of the United States were equally affected by the shift in status, The greatest statistically significant decreases in the 2nd highest 1-h average concentrations and the annual 4th highest daily maximum 8-h average concentration for the two temporal periods occurred in southern California. Monitoring sites in other portions of the United States experienced lesser decreases than this geographic area. In contrast to the two exposure indices, the vegetation-based 24-h W126 03 cumulative index for 1980-2005 experienced significant declines in the midwestern states and the northeastern United States as well as in southern California. For the 1990-2005 period, monitoring sites in southern California and the northeastern United States experienced the greatest decreases in the W126 exposure metric. Testing for statistically significant changes in the number of hourly average concentrations within specified concentration intervals identified specific months that experienced shifts in the distribution of the hourly average concentrations. We observed that a statistically significant trend at a specific monitoring site, using one exposure index, did not necessarily result in a similar trend using the other two indices. Because different trending patterns were observed when applying the various exposure indices, a careful selection of O-3 exposure metrics is required when assessing trends for specific purposes, such as human health, vegetation, and climate change effects.

N (the southern climatological storm track) is a strong predictor of stagnation and ozone pollution episodes in the eastern United States. The NCEP/NCAR Reanalysis, going back to 1948, shows a significant long-term decline in the number of summertime mid-latitude cyclones in that track starting in 1980 (-0.15 a<sup>-1</sup>). The more recent but shorter NCEP/DOE Reanalysis (1979-2006) shows similar interannual variability in cyclone frequency but no significant long-term trend. A GISS general circulation model (GCM) simulation including historical forcing by green house gases reproduces the cyclone trend seen in the NCEP/NCAR data. Such a long-term decrease in mid-latitude cyclone frequency over the 1980-2006 period would have offset by about a factor of 2 the ozone air quality gains from reductions in anthropogenic emissions in the northeastern United States. We find that if mid-latitude cyclone frequency had not declined, the northeastern US would have been largely compliant with the ozone air quality standard by 2001. Mid-latitude cyclone frequency is expected to decrease further over the coming decades in response to greenhouse warming and this trend needs to be considered in air quality management.

Approximately 1600 coincidences spanning 72.5 degrees S-80.3 degrees N from October 2004 to October 2006 are found. The TES averaging kernel and constraint are applied to the ozonesonde data to account for the TES measurement sensitivity and vertical resolution. TES sonde differences are examined in six latitude zones after excluding profiles with thick high clouds. Values for the bias and standard deviation are determined using correlations of mean values of TES ozone and sonde ozone in the upper troposphere (UT) and lower troposphere (LT). The UT biases range from 2.9 to 10.6 ppbv, and the LT biases range from 3.7 to 9.2 ppbv, excluding the Arctic and Antarctic LT where TES sensitivity is low. A similar approach is used to assess seasonal differences in the northern midlatitudes where the density and frequency of sonde measurements are greatest. These results are briefly compared to TES V001 ozone validation work which also used ozonesondes but was carried out prior to improvements in the radiometric calibration and ozone retrieval in V002. Overall, the large number of TES and sonde comparisons indicate a positive bias of approximately 3-10 ppbv for the TES V002 nadir ozone data set and have helped to identify areas of potential improvement for future retrieval versions.",3.5.5.5,Satellite Remote Sensing,0,0

By combining the data available from all marine boundary layer (MBL) sites with simultaneous wind data, decadal temporal trends of MBL O3 in all seasons are established with high precision. The average springtime temporal trend over the past two decades is 0.46 ppbv/yr with a 95% confidence limit of 0.13 ppbv/yr, and statistically significant trends are found for all seasons except autumn, which does have a significantly smaller trend than other seasons. The average trend in mean annual ozone is 0.34 +/- 0.09 ppbv/yr. These decadal trends at the North American west coast present a striking comparison and contrast with the trends reported for the European west coast at Mace Head, Ireland. The trends in the winter, spring and summer seasons compare well at the two locations, while the Mace Head trend is significantly greater in autumn. Even though the trends are similar, the absolute O-3 mixing ratios differ markedly, with the marine air arriving at Europe in all seasons containing 7 +/- 2 ppbv higher ozone than marine air arriving at North America. Further, the ozone mixing ratios at the North American west coast show no indication of stabilizing as has been reported for Mace Head. In a larger historical context the background boundary layer O-3 mixing ratios over the 130 years covered by available data have increased substantially (by a factor of two to three), and this increase continues at present, at least in the MBL of the Pacific coast region of North America. The reproduction of the increasing trends in MBL O-3 over the past two decades, as well as the difference in the O-3 mixing ratios between the two coastal regions will present a significant challenge for global chemical transport models. Further, the ability of the models to at least semi-quantitatively reproduce the longer-term, historical trends may an even greater challenge.",3.4.2,Contributions from Anthropogenic Emissions,0,0

We provide new constraints on the chemistry of the poorly-understood isoprene ?ZA'-hydroxy channels, which account for more than one third of the total isoprene carbon flux and a larger fraction of the nitrate yields. We show that the cis branch dominates the chemistry of the ?ZA'-hydroxy channel with less than 5% of the carbon following the trans branch. The modelled yield of isoprene nitrates is 12??A?3% with a large difference between the ?ZA' and ?ZA? branches. The oxidation of these nitrates releases about 50% of the NOx. Methacrolein nitrates (modelled yield ??a???? 15??A?3% from methacrolein) and methylvinylketone nitrates (modelled yield ??a???? 11??A?3% yield from methylvinylketone) are also observed. Propanone nitrate, produced with a yield of 1% from isoprene, appears to be the longest-lived nitrate formed in the total oxidation of isoprene.

Isoprene nitrates also represent a potentially large, unmeasured contribution to OH reactivity and are a major pathway for the removal of nitrogen oxides from the atmosphere. Current assessments indicate that formation rates of isoprene nitrates are uncertain to a factor of 2 3 and the subsequent fate of isoprene nitrates remains largely unconstrained by laboratory, field or modeling studies. Measurements of total alkyl and multifunctional nitrates (A#ANs), NO2, total peroxy nitrates (A#PNs), HNO3, CH2O, isoprene and other VOC were obtained from the NASA DC-8 aircraft during summer 2004 over the continental US during the INTEX-NA campaign. These observations represent the first characterization of A#ANs over a wide range of land surface types and in the lower free troposphere. A#ANs were a significant, 12 20%, fraction of NOy throughout the experimental domain and A#ANs were more abundant when isoprene was high. We use the observed hydrocarbon species to calculate the relative contributions of A#AN precursors to their production. These calculations indicate that isoprene represents at least three quarters of the A#AN source in the summertime continental boundary layer of the US. An observed correlation between A#ANs and CH2O is used to place constraints on nitrate yields from isoprene oxidation, atmospheric lifetimes of the resulting nitrates and recycling efficiencies of nitrates during subsequent oxidation. We find reasonable fits to the data using sets of production rates, lifetimes and recycling efficiencies of INs as follows (4.4%, 16 h, 97%), (8%, 2.5 h, 79%) and (12%, 95 min, 67%). The analysis indicates that the lifetime of A#ANs as a pool of compounds is considerably longer than the lifetime of the individual isoprene nitrates to reaction with OH, implying that the organic nitrate functionality is at least partially maintained through a second oxidation cycle.",3.2.2,Gas Phase Reactions Leading to O3 Formation,0,0

Four different sources of nitrous acid were considered in the study: gas-phase reactions, direct emissions, a heterogeneous reaction, and a surface photolysis reaction. When only gas-phase reactions were considered in the model, the diurnally averaged mean bias, the normalized mean bias, the root mean square error, and the normalized mean error of the model were ??E?a??1.01ppbv, ??E?a??98%, 1.05ppbv, and 98%, respectively.

Model results suggest that the heterogeneous reaction and the surface photolysis reaction are the most important sources of nitrous acid in the atmosphere, accounting for about 86% of the predicted nitrous acid. Emissions and the gas-phase reactions were relatively minor sources and accounted for only 14% of the predicted nitrous acid. Model predictions suggest that the heterogeneous reaction is the most significant source of nitrous acid at night, while the surface photolysis reaction is the most significant source during the day.

Identification of the minimal ozone (O-3) concentration and/or dose that induces measurable lung function decrements in humans is considered in the risk assessment leading to establishing an appropriate National Ambient Air Quality Standard for O-3 that protects public health. Objectives: To identify and/or predict the minimal mean O-3 concentration that produces a decrement in FEV1 and symptoms in healthy individuals completing 6.6-hour exposure protocols. Methods: Pulmonary function and subjective symptoms were measured in 31 healthy adults (18-25 yr, male and female, nonsmokers) who completed five 6.6-hour chamber exposures: filtered air and four variable hourly patterns with mean O-3 concentrations of 60, 70, 80, and 87 parts per billion (ppb). Measurements and Main Results: Compared with filtered air, statistically significant decrements in FEV1 and increases in total subjective symptoms scores (P < 0.05) were measured after exposure to mean concentrations of 70, 80, and 87 ppb O-3. The mean percent change in FEV1 (+/- standard error) at the end of each protocol was 0.80 +/- 0.90, -2.72 +/- 1.48, -5.34 +/- 1.42, -7.02 +/- 1.60, and -11.42 +/- 2.20% for exposure to filtered air and 60, 70, 80, and 87 ppb O-3, respectively.

Objectives: Heat and air pollution advisory systems are in place in many cities for early detection and response to reduce health consequences, or severity of adverse conditions. Where as the ability to forecast heat waves and/or air pollution episodes has become increasingly sophisticated and accurate, little is known about the effectiveness of advisories in altering public behavior. Methods: Air quality and meteorological conditions were measured during advisory and control days in Portland, OR and Houston, TX in 2005 and 2006 and 1962 subjects were interviewed by telephone about their perception and response to these conditions. Results: Elevated ambient temperatures were accurately recognized regardless of air conditioning use; respondents resorted to active cooling behavior (AC, fan, etc.), while in Houston no such in Portland, change was observed. More heat-related symptoms were reported in Portland compared to Houston, probably due to low air conditioning use in the northwest. One-third of study participants were aware of air quality advisories but only similar to 10-15% claimed to have changed activities during such an episode. Not the advisory, however, drove their behavior change, but rather the perception of poor air quality, which was not related to PM2.5 or ozone measurements. Conclusions: Messages are not reaching the public during potentially hazardous weather and air quality conditions. Climatic forecasts are increasingly predictive but public agencies fail to mount an appropriate outreach response. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",4.4.2,Ozone-Averting Behavior,0,0

Simulations for summer 2001 indicate mean North American and US background concentrations of 26 +/- 8 ppb and 30 +/- 8 ppb, as obtained by eliminating anthropogenic emissions in North America vs. in the US only. The US background never exceeds 60 ppb in the model. The Canadian and Mexican pollution enhancement averages 3 +/- 4 ppb in the US in summer but can be occasionally much higher in downwind regions of the northeast and southwest, peaking at 33 ppb in upstate New York (on a day with 75 ppb total ozone) and 18 ppb in southern California (on a day with 68 ppb total ozone). The model is successful in reproducing the observed variability of ozone in these regions, including the occurrence and magnitude of high-ozone episodes influenced by transboundary pollution. We find that exceedances of the 75 ppb US air quality standard in eastern Michigan, western New York, New Jersey, and southern California are often associated with Canadian and Mexican pollution enhancements in excess of 10 ppb.

The observations are interpreted with a global 3-D chemical transport model (GEOS-Chem). OMI NO2 satellite observations constrain Asian anthropogenic NOx emissions and indicate a factor of 2 increase from 2000 to 2006 in China. Satellite observations of CO from AIRS and TES indicate two major events of Asian transpacific pollution during INTEX-B. Correlation between TES CO and ozone observations shows evidence for transpacific ozone pollution. The semi-permanent Pacific High and Aleutian Low cause splitting of transpacific pollution plumes over the Northeast Pacific. The northern branch circulates around the Aleutian Low and has little impact on North America. The southern branch circulates around the Pacific High and some of that air impacts western North America. Both aircraft measurements and model results show sustained ozone production driven by peroxyacetylnitrate (PAN) decomposition in the southern branch, roughly doubling the transpacific influence from ozone produced in the Asian boundary layer. Model simulation of ozone observations at Mt. Bachelor Observatory in Oregon (2.7 km altitude) indicates a mean Asian ozone pollution contribution of 9 +/- 3 ppbv to the mean observed concentration of 54 ppbv, reflecting mostly an enhancement in background ozone rather than episodic Asian plumes.

The mechanisms, which regulate ozone-induced airway hyperresponsiveness, remain poorly understood. We have previously reported that toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4)-deficient animals are protected against ozone-induced airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR) and that hyaluronan (HA) mediates ozone-induced AHR. However, the relation between TLR4 and hyaluronan in the airway response to ozone remains unexplored. OBJECTIVES: We hypothesized that HA acts as an endogenous TLR4 ligand for the development of AHR after ozone-induced environmental airway injury. METHODS: TLR4-deficient and wild-type C57BL/6 mice were exposed to either inhaled ozone or intratracheal HA and the inflammatory and AHR response was measured. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: TLR4-deficient mice have similar levels of cellular inflammation, lung injury, and soluble HA levels as those of C57BL/6 mice after inhaled ozone exposure. However, TLR4-deficient mice are partially protected from AHR after ozone exposure as well as after direct intratracheal instillation of endotoxin-free low molecular weight HA. Similar patterns of TLR4-dependent cytokines were observed in the bronchial alveolar lavage fluid after exposure to either ozone or HA. Exposure to ozone increased immunohistological staining of TLR4 on lung macrophages. Furthermore, in vitro HA exposure of bone marrow-derived macrophages induced NF-kappaB and production of a similar pattern of proinflammatory cytokines in a manner dependent on TLR4. CONCLUSIONS: Our observations support the observation that extracellular matrix HA contributes to ozone-induced airways disease. Furthermore, our results support that TLR4 contributes to the biological response to HA by mediating both the production of proinflammatory cytokines and the development of ozone-induced AHR.",5.3.3,Initiation of inflammation,0,0

Carbon monoxide (CO) is one of six principal (or criteria) pollutants for which EPA has established NAAQS. Periodically, EPA reviews the scientific basis for these standards by preparing an Integrated Science Assessment (ISA) (formerly called an Air Quality Criteria Document). The ISA and supplementary annexes, in conjunction with additional technical and policy assessments, provide the scientific basis for EPA decisions on the adequacy of the current NAAQS and the appropriateness of possible alternative standards. The Clean Air Scientific Advisory Committee (CASAC), an independent science advisory committee whose existence and whose review and advisory functions are mandated by Section 109 (d) (2) of the Clean Air Act, is charged (among other things) with independent scientific review of EPA's air quality criteria.

Comparisons of the spatial distribution of nasal lesions in laboratory animals exposed to formaldehyde with gas uptake rates predicted by computational models reveal that lesions usually occur in regions of the susceptible epithelium where gas absorption is highest. Since the uptake patterns are influenced by air currents in the nose, interindividual variability in nasal anatomy and ventilation rates due to age, body size, and gender will affect the patterns of gas absorption in humans, potentially putting some age groups at higher risk when exposed to toxic gases. In this study, interhuman variability in the nasal dosimetry of reactive, water-soluble gases was investigated by means of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) models in 5 adults and 2 children, aged 7 and 8 years old. Airflow patterns were investigated for allometrically scaled inhalation rates corresponding to resting breathing. The spatial distribution of uptake at the airway walls was predicted to be nonuniform, with most of the gas being absorbed in the anterior portion of the nasal passages. Under the conditions of these simulations, interhuman variability in dose to the whole nose (mass per time per nasal surface area) due to differences in anatomy and ventilation was predicted to be 1.6-fold among the 7 individuals studied.

It is known that a number of natural compounds specifically activate those sensory neuronal TRP channels, and a well-known example is cinnamaldehyde for TRPA1. Here we show that human and mouse TRPA1 are activated by acetaldehyde, an intermediate substance of ethanol metabolism, in the HEK293T cell heterologous expression system and in cultured mouse trigeminal neurons. Acetaldehyde failed to activate other temperature-sensitive TRP channels expressed in sensory neurons. TRPA1 antagonists camphor and gadolinium, and a general TRP blocker ruthenium red inhibited TRPA1 activation by acetaldehyde. Camphor, gadolinium and ruthenium red also suppressed the acute nociceptive behaviors induced by the intradermal administration of acetaldehyde into the mouse footpads. Intradermal co-application of prostaglandin E2 and acetaldehyde greatly potentiated the acetaldehyde-induced nociceptive responses, and this effect was reversed by treatment with the TRPA1 antagonist camphor.

Studies focusing on immune, smooth muscle, and airway epithelial function revealed many aspects of the disease mechanism of asthma. However, the limited efficacies of immune-directed therapies suggest the involvement of additional mechanisms in asthmatic airway inflammation. TRPA1 is an irritant-sensing ion channel expressed in airway chemosensory nerves. TRPA1-activating stimuli such as cigarette smoke, chlorine, aldehydes, and scents are among the most prevalent triggers of asthma. Endogenous TRPA1 agonists, including reactive oxygen species and lipid peroxidation products, are potent drivers of allergen-induced airway inflammation in asthma. Here, we examined the role of TRPA1 in allergic asthma in the murine ovalbumin model. Strikingly, genetic ablation of TRPA1 inhibited allergen-induced leukocyte infiltration in the airways, reduced cytokine and mucus production, and almost completely abolished airway hyperreactivity to contractile stimuli. This phenotype is recapitulated by treatment of wild-type mice with HC-030031, a TRPA1 antagonist. HC-030031, when administered during airway allergen challenge, inhibited eosinophil infiltration and prevented the development of airway hyperreactivity. Trpa1?/? mice displayed deficiencies in chemically and allergen-induced neuropeptide release in the airways, providing a potential explanation for the impaired inflammatory response. Our data suggest that TRPA1 is a key integrator of interactions between the immune and nervous systems in the airways, driving asthmatic airway inflammation following inhaled allergen challenge.

A mechanism for cPLA2 activity regulation through a signal transduction pathway has been proposed and this signaling appears to be influenced by oxidants. Oxidant-mediated signaling of PLA2 may serve as an alternative mechanism for enzyme regulation; however, the manner of regulation has yet to be delineated. In this report we demonstrate that there is a direct effect of membrane oxidation on cPLA2 phosphorylation and activity. A simple in vitro system consisting of purified cPLA2 and phospholipid vesicles was used to facilitate protein kinase C (PKC) activity and provide substrates for cPLA2. Using these vesicles we found that the activity of cPLA2 was enhanced twofold when the vesicles contained as little as 5 mol% phosphatidylcholine hydroperoxides (PLPCOOH). The order of hydrolytic preference for fatty acyl species was 20:4 > 18:2 > 18:1 > 16:0, and the presence of PLPCOOH stimulated hydrolysis largely of phosphatidylcholine containing 20:4. The Ca2+ concentrations required for stimulated hydrolytic activity were also twofold lower for oxidized compared to unoxidized vesicles. Using phospholipid micelles as substrates, PKC-mediated phosphorylation of cPLA2 increased hydrolytic activity 71% compared to preparations lacking PKC. Using phospholipid vesicles as substrates, PKC-mediated phosphorylation resulted in an 85% increase in cPLA2 activity compared to preparations without PKC. PKC-mediated phosphorylation of cPLA2, therefore, stimulates catalytic activity toward membrane phospholipids and the extent of activation is enhanced directly by peroxidation of membrane phospholipids and involves a peroxide-induced stimulation of cPLA2 phosphorylation.",5.3.3,Initiation of inflammation,0,0

Oxidative stress, a pathological feature of many respiratory diseases, causes the endogenous formation of a number of reactive electrophilic alkenals via lipid peroxidation. One such alkenal, 4-hydroxynonenal (4HNE), activates TRPA1 in cultured sensory neurones. However, our data demonstrate that 100 ?m 4HNE was unable to evoke significant action potential discharge or tachykinin release from bronchopulmonary C-fibre terminals. Instead, another endogenously produced alkenal, 4-oxononenal (4ONE, 10 ?m), which is far more electrophilic than 4HNE, caused substantial action potential discharge and tachykinin release from bronchopulmonary C-fibre terminals. The activation of mouse bronchopulmonary C-fibre terminals by 4ONE (10?100 ?m) was mediated entirely by TRPA1 channels, based on the absence of responses in C-fibre terminals from TRPA1 knockout mice. Interestingly, although the robust increases in calcium caused by 4ONE (0.1?10 ?m) in dissociated vagal neurones were essentially abolished in TRPA1 knockout mice, at 100 ?m 4ONE caused a large TRPV1-dependent response. Furthermore, 4ONE (100 ?m) was shown to activate TRPV1 channel-expressing HEK cells. In conclusion, the data support the hypothesis that 4-ONE is a relevant endogenous activator of vagal C-fibres via an interaction with TRPA1, and at less relevant concentrations, it may activate nerves via TRPV1.

Unexpectedly, CAP pretreatment caused divergent results in the functional responses to O3. Ventilatory measurements obtained from CAP-pretreated O3-exposed (CAP-O3) animals were exacerbated rather than diminished compared with the effects of O3 alone. Similarly, lavage fluid protein accumulation was enhanced in the CAP-O3 group compared with the O3-exposed group. In better agreement with our initial hypothesis, the CAP-O3 group was less responsive than the O3-exposed animals to histamine aerosol challenge. Additionally, Evans blue dye accumulation, a hallmark of tachykinin release, was increased in O3-exposed animals and was partially blocked in the CAP-O3 group. These data suggest that tachykinin-containing sensory fibers are unlikely to mediate the acute effects of O3 exposure on tidal breathing and lavage fluid protein accumulation but may play a role in causing post-O3 airway hyperreactivity and protein extravasation into the trachea.",5.3.5,Sensitization of Bronchial Smooth Muscle,0,0

Here, we report that recombinant or native TRPA1 channels are activated by 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal (HNE), an endogenous ?,?-unsaturated aldehyde that is produced when reactive oxygen species peroxidate membrane phospholipids in response to tissue injury, inflammation, and oxidative stress. HNE provokes release of substance P and calcitonin gene-related peptide from central (spinal cord) and peripheral (esophagus) nerve endings, resulting in neurogenic plasma protein extravasation in peripheral tissues. Moreover, injection of HNE into the rodent hind paw elicits pain-related behaviors that are inhibited by TRPA1 antagonists and absent in animals lacking functional TRPA1 channels. These findings demonstrate that HNE activates TRPA1 on nociceptive neurons to promote acute pain, neuropeptide release, and neurogenic inflammation. Our results also provide a mechanism-based rationale for developing novel analgesic or anti-inflammatory agents that target HNE production or TRPA1 activation.

Although substantial evidence suggests that SP is released by sensory nerves, SP is also present in neurons of airway ganglia. The purpose of this study was to investigate the role of intrinsic airway neurons in O3-enhanced airway responsiveness in ferret trachea. To remove the effects of sensory innervation, segments of ferret trachea were maintained in culture conditions for 24 h before in vitro exposure to 2 parts/million of O3 or air for 1 h. Sensory nerve depletion was confirmed by showing that capsaicin did not affect tracheal smooth muscle responsiveness to cholinergic agonist or contractility responses to electrical field stimulation (EFS). Contractions of isolated tracheal smooth muscle to EFS were significantly increased after in vitro O3 exposure, but the constrictor response to cholinergic agonist was not altered. Pretreatment with CP-99994, an antagonist of the neurokinin 1 receptor, attenuated the increased contraction to EFS after O3 exposure but had no effect in the air exposure group. The number of SP-positive neurons in longitudinal trunk ganglia, the extent of SP innervation to superficial muscular plexus nerve cell bodies, and SP nerve fiber density in tracheal smooth muscle all increased significantly after O3 exposure. The results show that release of SP from intrinsic airway neurons contributes to O3-enhanced tracheal smooth muscle responsiveness by facilitating acetylcholine release from cholinergic nerve terminals.",5.3.5,Sensitization of Bronchial Smooth Muscle,0,0

These OMI-MLS TCOs were compared against ozonesonde measurements from the Intercontinental Chemical Transport Experiment (INTEX) Ozonesonde Network Study (IONS) campaign over North America in spring and summer, 2006. The OMI-MLS potential vorticity mapped TCOs are smaller than IONS TCOs by 5.9 DU (9.9 ppb when expressed as volume mixing ratio) with a standard deviation of the differences of 8.4 DU (14.4 ppb) and a standard error of the mean differences of approximately 0.5 DU (0.7 ppb). Compared to previously published versions, these OMI-MLS TCOs are an additional 2 DU smaller relative to ozonesonde measurements. The extra 2 DU arises from changes in OMI (~?3 to ?6 DU) and MLS (?1 to 3 DU), giving a net change of ?2 DU. OMI-MLS TCOs derived using OMI Differential Optical Absorption Spectroscopy (DOAS) show similar differences in summer, but these TCOs are smaller than the sondes by only 2 DU (5 ppb) in spring. OMI-MLS TCOs derived from TOMS total ozone retrievals lead to better results when validated against IONS data, with less noise and a better seasonal consistency. Tropospheric ozone columns were also compared to those from GEOS-Chem model simulations in main distribution features. In the spring and summer of 2005 and 2006, the most dominant enhancement features are a tongue of enhancement stretching from around Yellow Sea northeastward into the Pacific and an enhancement band over the North America centered over the eastern United States and the adjacent ocean. The OMI-MLS TCO enhancements over the western Pacific and over the eastern United States increased from March to June and then decreased. In the GEOS-Chem model simulations, the monthly variation tendency is similar to that of satellite data over the west Pacific but the decrease tendency from June into August over eastern United States is less dramatic. A springtime TCO enhancement event of a few days duration over coastal California was investigated to demonstrate the ability of OMI-MLS mapped TCO columns in capturing ozone enhancements associated with stratospheric intrusions and trans-Pacific transport. Tagged ozone model simulations support the stratospheric contributions to the high TCOs over coastal California and over the Baja peninsula, and meteorological fields indicate that the stratospheric intrusions are associated with Rossby wave breaking events. Furthermore, back trajectory studies and comparisons of GEOS-Chem standard simulations and sensitivity runs with Asia anthropogenic emissions turned off provide evidence that the high tropospheric ozone columns over coastal California near Santa Barbara, California, has been influenced by cross-Pacific transport.

Formaldehyde (HCHO) is a key species in understanding ozone related air pollution; some of the highest HCHO concentrations in North America have been reported for the HGA. We report on HCHO measurements in the HGA from summer 2006. Among several sites, maximum HCHO mixing ratios were observed in the Houston Ship Channel (HSC), a region with a very high density of industrial/petrochemical operations.

HCHO levels at the Moody Tower (MT) site close to downtown were dependent on the wind direction: southerly maritime winds brought in background levels (0.5?1 ppbv) while trajectories originating in the HSC resulted in high HCHO (up to 31.5 ppbv). Based on the best multiparametric linear regression model fit, the HCHO levels at the MT site can be accounted for as follows: 38.5?12.3% from primary vehicular emissions (using CO as an index of vehicular emission), 24.1?17.7% formed photochemically (using peroxyacetic nitric anhydride (PAN) as an index of photochemical activity) and 8.9?11.2% from industrial emissions (using SO2 as an index of industrial emissions). The balance 28.5?12.7% constituted the residual which cannot be easily ascribed to the above categories and/or which is transported into the HGA. The CO related HCHO fraction is dominant during the morning rush hour (06:00?09:00 h, all times are given in CDT); on a carbon basis, HCHO emissions are up to 0.7% of the CO emissions. The SO2 related HCHO fraction is significant between 09:00?12:00 h. After 12:00 h HCHO is largely formed through secondary processes. The HCHO/PAN ratios are dependent on the SO2 levels.

The 2000-2050 changes in anthropogenic emissions reduce the U.S. summer daily maximum 8?hour ozone by 2-15 ppb, but climate change causes a 2-5 ppb positive offset over the Midwest and northeastern United States, partly driven by decreased ventilation from convection and frontal passages. Ozone pollution episodes are far more affected by climate change than mean values, with effects exceeding 10 ppb in the Midwest and northeast. We find that ozone air quality in the southeast is insensitive to climate change, reflecting compensating effects from changes in isoprene emission and air pollution meteorology. We define a ?climate change penalty? as the additional emission controls necessary to meet a given ozone air quality target. We find that a 50% reduction in U.S. NOx emissions is needed in the 2050 climate to reach the same target in the Midwest as a 40% reduction in the 2000 climate.

Studies on a selected commercially available CMM showed that 120 ppb of ozone could exert an interference of approximately 63 ng/m3 on Hg measurement. This interference may consequently affect the risk assessment of human exposure to Hg. On a similar basis, it was found that Hg can also result in significant interferences on an ozone analyzer based on UV absorption. Results showed that Hg at a concentration of 300 ng/m3 can potentially cause a bias in ozone measurement of approximately 35 ppb, comparable to the average ambient ozone concentration. It should be noted that interferences discussed in this paper are applicable only to UV-absorption-based Hg and ozone analyzers.

The second method (CTM method) uses a chemical transport model (CTM) as an intercomparison platform; it provides a globally complete intercomparison with relatively small noise added by model error. The third method (averaging kernel smoothing method) involves smoothing the retrieved profile from one instrument with the averaging kernel matrix of the other; it also provides a global intercomparison but dampens the actual difference between instruments and adds noise from the a priori. Application to a full year (2006) of TES and OMI data shows mean positive biases of 5.3 parts per billion volume (ppbv) (10%) for TES and 2.8 ppbv (5%) for OMI at 500 hPa relative to in situ data from ozonesondes.

It reveals that differences between TES and OMI are generally less than 10 ppbv (18%), except at northern mid-latitudes in summer and over tropical continents. The CTM method allows for well-constrained CTM evaluation in places where the satellite observations are consistent.

Instead, most represent part of a more complex web or ""pattern"" of conditions that are connected via underlying biological mechanisms and processes, emerge across a lifetime, and have been identified with the aid of large medical databases. OBJECTIVE: We have described how an understanding of patterns of disease may be used to develop new strategies for reducing the prevalence and risk of major immune-based illnesses and diseases influenced by environmental stimuli. FINDINGS: Examples of recently defined patterns of diseases that begin in childhood include not only metabolic syndrome, with its characteristics of inflammatory dysregulation, but also allergic, autoimmune, recurrent infection, and other inflammatory patterns of disease. The recent identification of major immune-based disease patterns beginning in childhood suggests that the immune system may play an even more important role in determining health status and health care needs across a lifetime than was previously understood. CONCLUSIONS: Focusing on patterns of disease, as opposed to individual conditions, offers two important venues for environmental health risk reduction. First, prevention of developmental immunotoxicity and pediatric immune dysfunction can be used to act against multiple diseases. Second, pattern-based treatment of entryway diseases can be tailored with the aim of disrupting the entire disease pattern and reducing the risk of later-life illnesses connected to underlying immune dysfunction.

Glutathione S-transferases (GSTs) can modulate the intracellular concentrations of HNE by affecting its generation during lipid peroxidation by reducing hydroperoxides and also by converting it into a glutathione conjugate. We have recently demonstrated that overexpression of the Alpha class GSTs in cells leads to lower steady-state levels of HNE, and these cells acquire resistance to apoptosis induced by lipid peroxidation-causing agents such as H2O2, UVA, superoxide anion, and pro-oxidant xenobiotics, suggesting that signaling for apoptosis by these agents is transduced through HNE. Cells with the capacity to exclude HNE from the intracellular environment at a faster rate are relatively more resistant to apoptosis caused by H2O2, UVA, superoxide anion, and pro-oxidant xenobiotics as well as by HNE, suggesting that HNE may be a common denominator in mechanisms of apoptosis caused by oxidative stress. We have also shown that transfection of adherent cells with HNE-metabolizing GSTs leads to transformation of these cells due to depletion of HNE. These recent studies from our laboratories, which strongly suggest that HNE is a key signaling molecule and that GSTs, being determinants of its intracellular concentrations, can regulate stress-mediated signaling, are reviewed in this article.",5.4.2.1,Gene environment Interactions ,0,0

This problem was addressed using specific assays for each compound, freshly synthesized pure dehydroascorbic acid, the specially synthesized analog 6-chloroascorbate, and a new assay for 6-chloroascorbate. Ascorbate and dehydroascorbic acid were transported and accumulated distinctly; neither competed with the other. Ascorbate was accumulated as ascorbate by sodium-dependent carrier-mediated active transport. Dehydroascorbic acid transport and accumulation as ascorbate was at least 10-fold faster than ascorbate transport and was sodium-independent. Once transported, dehydroascorbic acid was immediately reduced intracellularly to ascorbate. The analog 6-chloroascorbate had no effect on dehydroascorbic acid transport but was a competitive inhibitor of ascorbate transport. The Ki for 6-chloroascorbate (2.9-4.4 microM) was similar to the Km for ascorbate transport (9.8-12.6 microM). 6-Chloroascorbate was itself transported and accumulated in fibroblasts by a sodium-dependent transporter.

However, clinical trials revealed that aerosolized nucleotides provide only a transient improvement of MCC to patients diagnosed with cystic fibrosis (CF). In this study, we identified the mechanism that eliminates extracellular nucleotides from human airways. Polarized primary cultures of human bronchial epithelial cells were impermeable to extracellular nucleotides but rapidly dephosphorylated ATP into ADP, AMP, and adenosine. The half-life of a therapeutic ATP concentration (0.1 mm) was approximately 20 s within the periciliary liquid layer. The mucosal epithelial surface eliminated P2 receptor agonists (ATP = UTP > ADP > UDP) at 3-fold higher rates than the serosal surface. We also showed that mucosal (not serosal) ectoATPase activity increases toward areas most susceptible to airway obstruction (nose < bronchi << bronchioles). Bronchial cultures from patients with CF, primary ciliary dyskinesia, or alpha1-antitrypsin deficiency exhibited 3-fold higher mucosal (not serosal) ectoATPase activity than normal cultures. Time course experiments indicated that CF enhances ATP elimination and adenosine accumulation on the mucosal surface. Furthermore, nonspecific alkaline phosphatase was identified as the major regulator of airway nucleotide concentrations in CF, primary ciliary dyskinesia, and alpha1-antitrypsin deficiency. The ectoAT-Pase activity and mRNA expression of mucosally restricted nonspecific alkaline phosphatase were 3-fold higher on bronchial cultures from these patients than from healthy subjects.

Using the policy-relevant maximum daily 8-h average ozone (MDA8 O3) statistic, the multi-model ensemble represents the observations well (mean r2=0.57, ensemble bias = +4.1 ppbv for all US regions and all seasons) despite a wide range in the individual model results. Correlations are strongest in the northeastern US during spring and fall (r2=0.68); and weakest in the midwestern US in summer (r2=0.46). However, large positive mean biases exist during summer for all eastern US regions, ranging from 10?20 ppbv, and a smaller negative bias is present in the western US during spring (~3 ppbv). In nearly all other regions and seasons, the biases of the model ensemble simulations are ?5 ppbv. Sensitivity simulations in which anthropogenic O3-precursor emissions (NOx + NMVOC + CO + aerosols) were decreased by 20% in four source regions: East Asia (EA), South Asia (SA), Europe (EU) and North America (NA) show that the greatest response of MDA8 O3 to the summed foreign emissions reductions occurs during spring in the West (0.9 ppbv reduction due to 20% emissions reductions from EA + SA + EU). East Asia is the largest contributor to MDA8 O3 at all ranges of the O3 distribution for most regions (typically ~0.45 ppbv) followed closely by Europe. The exception is in the northeastern US where emissions reductions in EU had a slightly greater influence than EA emissions, particularly in the middle of the MDA8 O3 distribution (response of ~0.35 ppbv between 35?55 ppbv). EA and EU influences are both far greater (about 4x) than that from SA in all regions and seasons. In all regions and seasons O3-precursor emissions reductions of 20% in the NA source region decrease MDA8 O3 the most ? by a factor of 2 to nearly 10 relative to foreign emissions reductions. The O3 response to anthropogenic NA emissions is greatest in the eastern US during summer at the high end of the O3 distribution (5?6 ppbv for 20% reductions).

Spatial variability of ozone, quantified as the root mean squared deviation of hourly ozone per kilometer horizontal separation, decreased with elevation and distance from local sources, validating the assumption that (except at the City of Boulder (BO) site) the results of the study are representative of the Colorado Front Range. The northern hemisphere (NH) tropospheric spring ozone peak was clearly apparent in late April and early May and affected ozone at all elevations. Ozone consistently increased with elevation during winter, with a mean monthly rate of 1.5 ppbv per 100 m elevation. In summer, this monotonic increase in ozone with elevation was not observed; instead mean monthly ozone increased in two steps, by not, vert, similar15 ppbv between 1610 m and 1940 m ASL and by not, vert, similar10 ppbv between 3350 m and 3530 m ASL to a maximum of 60 ppbv. The amplitude of the diurnal ozone cycle decreased with increasing elevation. Average summertime diurnal swings in ozone concentration had a magnitude of 29 ppbv at 1610 m ASL, and 7?16 ppbv at the mid-elevation sites. In winter a diurnal cycle was observed only at the BO site, ozone concentrations at the remaining six locations changed on a multi-day timescale, indicating regional background behavior as the primary factor for wintertime ozone. Even the highest elevation site was influenced by transported urban air pollution in summer, indicated by the average 5 ppbv diurnal increase in ozone. Ozone exposure at the mid- to high-elevation sites in many instances approached and exceeded the 8-h National Ambient Air Quality Standard of 75 ppbv.

We apply an ensemble of 21 global and hemispheric chemical transport models to estimate the spatial average surface O3 response over east Asia (EA), Europe (EU), North America (NA), and south Asia (SA) to 20% decreases in anthropogenic emissions of the O3 precursors, NOx, NMVOC, and CO (individually and combined), from each of these regions. We find that the ensemble mean surface O3 concentrations in the base case (year 2001) simulation matches available observations throughout the year over EU but overestimates them by >10 ppb during summer and early fall over the eastern United States and Japan. The sum of the O3 responses to NOx, CO, and NMVOC decreases separately is approximately equal to that from a simultaneous reduction of all precursors. We define a continental?scale ?import sensitivity? as the ratio of the O3 response to the 20% reductions in foreign versus ?domestic? (i.e., over the source region itself) emissions. For example, the combined reduction of emissions from the three foreign regions produces an ensemble spatial mean decrease of 0.6 ppb over EU (0.4 ppb from NA), less than the 0.8 ppb from the reduction of EU emissions, leading to an import sensitivity ratio of 0.7. The ensemble mean surface O3 response to foreign emissions is largest in spring and late fall (0.7?0.9 ppb decrease in all regions from the combined precursor reductions in the three foreign regions), with import sensitivities ranging from 0.5 to 1.1 (responses to domestic emission reductions are 0.8?1.6 ppb). High O3 values are much more sensitive to domestic emissions than to foreign emissions, as indicated by lower import sensitivities of 0.2 to 0.3 during July in EA, EU, and NA when O3 levels are typically highest and by the weaker relative response of annual incidences of daily maximum 8?h average O3 above 60 ppb to emission reductions in a foreign region (<10?20% of that to domestic) as compared to the annual mean response (up to 50% of that to domestic). Applying the ensemble annual mean results to changes in anthropogenic emissions from 1996 to 2002, we estimate a Northern Hemispheric increase in background surface O3 of about 0.1 ppb a?1, at the low end of the 0.1?0.5 ppb a?1 derived from observations. From an additional simulation in which global atmospheric methane was reduced, we infer that 20% reductions in anthropogenic methane emissions from a foreign source region would yield an O3 response in a receptor region that roughly equals that produced by combined 20% reductions of anthropogenic NOx, NMVOC, and CO emissions from the foreign source region.",3.3.1,Global Scale CTMs,0,0

In discussing background ozone, it is important to be clear what is meant by the term. Slightly different interpretations of the exact understanding of what constitutes background widen the uncertainty in reported values. Nevertheless, the central tendency to reported background ozone concentrations may be estimated as 25 to 40 ppb for measurements made worldwide. The large majority of recently reported work indicates that these background concentrations are increasing at a rate ranging up to about 0.3 to 0.5 ppb per year.

Pollutant emissions for each mobile source category were estimated by combining fuel consumption with emission factors expressed per unit of fuel burned. Over the 10-year time period that is the focus of this study, sales of gasoline and diesel fuel intended for on-road use increased by 15 and 43%, respectively. Diesel fuel use by off-road equipment increased by ~20% over the same time period. Growth in fuel consumption offset some of the reductions in pollutant emission factors that occurred during this period. For NOx, there have been dramatic (factor of 2) decreases in emission factors for on-road gasoline engines between 1996 and 2006. In contrast, diesel NOx emission factors decreased more gradually. Exhaust PM2.5 emission factors appear to have decreased for most engine categories, but emission uncertainties are large for this pollutant. Diesel engines appear to be the dominant mobile source of both NOx and PM2.5; the diesel share of total NOx has increased over time as gasoline engine emissions have declined. Comparing fuel-based emission estimates with U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's national emission inventory led to the following conclusions: (1) total emissions of NOx and PM2.5 estimated by two different methods were similar, (2) source contributions to these totals differ significantly, with higher relative contributions coming from on-road diesel engines in this study.",3.2.1,Sources of Precursors Involved in O3 Formation,0,0

We increase the model lightning NOx source over northern midlatitude continents (by a factor of 10) and the fraction emitted into the free troposphere (FT, from 80% to 98%) to better match the recent observation?based estimates. While these NOx source updates improve the simulation of NOx and O3 compared to the Intercontinental Chemical Transport Experiment?North America aircraft observations, a bias in the partitioning between nitric acid (HNO3) and peroxyacetylnitrate (PAN) remains especially above 8 km, suggesting gaps in the current understanding of upper tropospheric processes.

Lightning NOx contributes 24%?43% of the FT NOy export from the U.S. to the North Atlantic and 28%?34% to the NOy wet deposition over the United States, with the ranges reflecting different assumptions. Increasing lightning NOx decreases the fractional contribution of PAN to total NOy export, increases the O3 production in the northern extratropical FT by 33%, and decreases the regional mean ozone production efficiency per unit NOx (OPE) by 30%. If models underestimate the lightning NOx source, they would overestimate the background OPE in the FT and the fractional contribution of PAN to NOy export. Therefore, a model underestimate of lightning NOx would likely lead to an overestimate of the downwind O3 production due to anthropogenic NOx export.

Episodes of elevated levels of IO (up to 3.4 ? 1.2 ppt) accompanied by a variety of iodocarbons were observed.

A combination of long-path DOAS and multiaxis DOAS observations suggested that the IO is limited to about 100 m in height. The observations are interpreted using a one-dimensional model, which indicates that the iodocarbon sources from these exposed waters can account for the observed concentrations of IO. These levels of IO deplete O3 at rates comparable to bromine oxide (BrO) and, more importantly, strongly enhance the effect of bromine-catalyzed O3 depletion in the Arctic BL, an effect which has not been quantitatively considered hitherto.

These studies suggest that the elderly and those with certain genetic polymorphisms are susceptible to adverse air pollution-associated health events. Hypothesis/objective: We hypothesize that physiological responses to air pollutants vary with age and are genetically influenced. Materials and methods: To test this hypothesis, we exposed mice from three inbred strains (C57BL/6J, B6; C3H/HeJ, HeJ; C3H/HeOuJ, OuJ) to ozone (O3) and carbon black (CB) at two ages, (5 months, 12 months), for 3 consecutive days, to either filtered air (FA), CB particles, or O3 and CB sequentially (O3CB) (CB, 550?g/m3; O3, 600 ppb). Heart rate (HR), HR variability (HRV), breathing, and core temperature (Tco) responses were analyzed. Results: We observed time-dependent physiological changes in response to O3CB exposure in each strain, relative to FA exposure for both age groups. Each mouse strain showed distinct adaptation profiles to repeated acute exposures to O3. In younger mice, several time-dependent effects (decreased HR and increased HRV) were prominent in HeJ and OuJ mice but not B6 mice. We also observed variability in adaptation in older mice. However, responses in older mice were generally attenuated when compared to the younger mice. In addition, cardiac?respiratory interactions were affected with CB and O3CB exposures albeit with patterns differing by age or exposure. Discussion/conclusion: Our results suggest that age considerably attenuates physiological responses to O3 and O3CB exposures. Age-related physiological changes such as increased oxidative stress in mouse tissue may be involved in this attenuation.",5.4.2.4,Lifestage,0,0

Interleukin-10 (IL-10) is an anti-inflammatory cytokine that is known to inhibit inflammatory mediators. Objectives: We investigated the molecular mechanisms underlying interleuken-10 (IL-10)?mediated attenuation of O3-induced pulmonary inflammation in mice. Methods: Il10-deficient (Il10?/?) and wild-type (Il10+/+) mice were exposed to 0.3 ppm O3 or filtered air for 24, 48, or 72 hr. Immediately after exposure, differential cell counts and total protein (a marker of lung permeability) were assessed from bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF). mRNA and protein levels of cellular mediators were determined from lung homogenates. We also used global mRNA expression analyses of lung tissue with Ingenuity Pathway Analysis to identify patterns of gene expression through which IL-10 modifies O3-induced inflammation. Results: Mean numbers of BALF polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs) were significantly greater in Il10?/? mice than in Il10+/+ mice after exposure to O3 at all time points tested. O3-enhanced nuclear NF-?B translocation was elevated in the lungs of Il10?/? compared with Il10+/+ mice. Gene expression analyses revealed several IL-10?dependent and O3-dependent mediators, including macrophage inflammatory protein 2, cathepsin E, and serum amyloid A3. Conclusions: Results indicate that IL-10 protects against O3-induced pulmonary neutrophilic inflammation and cell proliferation. Moreover, gene expression analyses identified three response pathways and several genetic targets through which IL-10 may modulate the innate and adaptive immune response. These novel mechanisms of protection against the pathogenesis of O3-induced pulmonary inflammation may also provide potential therapeutic targets to protect susceptible individuals.",5.3.3,Initiation of inflammation,0,0

This leads to activation of intracellular NF-?B signaling and proinflammatory cytokine production. Based on previous information that ozone exposure causes increased HA in bronchial alveolar lavage fluid and ozone pre-exposure primes immune response to inhaled LPS, we hypothesized that HA production during ozone exposure augments the inflammatory response to LPS. We demonstrate that acute ozone exposure at 1 part per million for 3 h primes the immune response to low-dose aerosolized LPS in C57BL/6J mice, resulting in increased neutrophil recruitment into the airspaces, increased levels of protein and proinflammatory cytokines in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, and increased airway hyperresponsiveness. Intratracheal instillation of endotoxin-free HA (25 ?g) enhances the biological response to inhaled LPS in a manner similar to ozone pre-exposure. In vitro studies using bone marrow-derived macrophages indicate that HA enhances LPS responses measured by TNF-? production, while immunofluorescence staining of murine alveolar macrophages demonstrates that HA induces TLR4 peripheralization and lipid raft colocalization. Collectively, our observations support that ozone primes macrophage responsiveness to low-dose LPS, in part, due to HA-induced TLR4 peripheralization in lung macrophages.",5.3.6,Modification of Innate/Adaptive Immune System Responses,0,0

One day after ozone airway hyperreactivity is mediated by release of eosinophil major basic protein that inhibits neuronal M(2) muscarinic receptors, resulting in increased acetylcholine release and increased smooth muscle contraction in guinea pigs. Three days after ozone, IL-1?, not eosinophils, mediates ozone-induced airway hyperreactivity, but the mechanism at this time-point is largely unknown. IL-1? increases nerve growth factor (NGF) and the tachykinin substance P, both of which are involved in neural plasticity. These experiments were designed to test whether there is a role for NGF and tachykinins in sustained airway hyperreactivity following a single ozone exposure. Guinea pigs were exposed to filtered air or ozone (2ppm, 4 hours). In anesthetized and vagotomized animals ozone potentiated vagally mediated airway hyperreactivity 24 hours later, an effect that was sustained over three days. Pretreatment with antibody to NGF completely prevented ozone-induced airway hyperreactivity three days, but not one day after ozone, and significantly reduced the number of substance P positive airway nerve bundles. Three days after ozone, NK(1) and NK(2) receptor antagonists also blocked this sustained hyperreactivity. Although the effect of inhibiting NK(2) receptors was independent of ozone, the NK(1) receptor antagonist selectively blocked vagal hyperreactivity three days after ozone. These data confirm mechanisms of ozone-induced airway hyperreactivity change over time, and demonstrate three days after ozone, there is an NGF mediated role for substance P, or another NK(1) receptor agonist, that enhances acetylcholine release, and was not present one day after ozone.",5.3.2,Activation of Neural Reflexes,0,0

Sulphuric acid concentrations were usually below the detectable limit of 2 ?g/m3. The highest hourly concentrations of 5 ?g/m3 were attained on days of relatively low sulphur concentrations. Due to the low concentrations of SO2 and H2SO4, these environmental variables will not be considered further here.

The environmental factors of interest are PM2.5, SO4=, O3 (one-hour maximum), temperature, and relative humidity, where SO4=, temperature, and relative humidity are averages of continuous measurements over the sampling period. The values of these variables are listed by lung-function testing period in Table 1. Two periods of elevated pollution levels occurred during the study period, the first lasting from 30 June P. M. to 1 July P. M., and the second from 3 July P. M. to 4 July P. M. On four of the nine days, the current Ontario air-quality standard for ozone of 80 ppb (1-hour maximum) was attained or exceeded. A back-trajectory analysis conducted by Environment Canada showed air-mass transport from the Ohio valley on both 30 June and 3 July.

Fifty-two campers, including 23 asthmatics (12 boys and 11 girls) and 29 nonasthmatics (16 boys and 13 girls), completed all components of the study. The mean values of the three lung-function indictors (FVC, FEV1.0, and PEF) for asthmatics and nonasthmatics are given in Table 2 for each of 18 testing periods. The first testing period (29 June P. M.) was considered as a training session and is not included in this presentation. The three lung-function responses tend to follow a similar pattern over time, with the highest responses occurring at the beginning of the camp, followed by a steep decline for several subsequent testing periods. A gradual increase is then observed, with some stabilization occurring near the completion of the camp. The child-specific variation in lung function over time is given in Table 3. There are appreciable differences in the variance of the lung-function measurements between children, with asthmatics tending to exhibit larger variances than their nonasthmatic counterparts.

Table 4 gives the frequency of a positive response to several questions concerning respiratory symptoms for each session for asthmatics and nonasthmatics respectively. Here, a positive response to Cough and Sneeze is defined as an occurrence of these symptoms five or more times since the previous lung-function testing session. The number of children using medication since the last session is also reported.

Starting in the 1980s, FRM monitors were replaced by FEMs so that today virtually all monitoring in the United States uses the UV methodology. This report summarizes a laboratory and collocated ambient air monitoring study of interferences in O-3 monitors. Potential interferences examined in the laboratory included water vapor, mercury, o-nitrophenol, naphthalene, p-tolualdehyde, and mixed reaction products from smog chamber simulations of urban atmospheric photochemistry. UV absorption O-3 monitors modified for humidity equilibration were also collocated with UV FEM O-3 monitors at six sites in Houston, TX, during the 2007 summer O-3 season.

The yearly roadside concentrations of CO and SO2 showed a well-defined decreasing trend, whereas those of NO2 and O3 exhibited the reverse trend. In most cases, the diurnal trends of the roadside concentrations were well-defined for all seasons, plus the daytime concentrations were higher than the nighttime concentrations. In contrast to the other target pollutants, the daytime O3 concentrations observed at the roadside sites were lower than those observed at the residential site, likely due to high-levels of fresh NO from traffic emissions that rapidly react with O3, thereby reducing the O3 roadside level. The Sunday roadside concentrations of CO, NO2, and SO2 were similar to or somewhat lower than the weekday concentrations. Conversely, for O3 the Sunday roadside concentrations were similar to or somewhat higher than the weekday concentrations. The higher O3 concentrations on Sunday may be due to the reduced titration from a decrease in NOx emissions under VOC-limited conditions (low VOC/NOx conditions). The monthly averages of O3 concentrations exhibited the reverse seasonal variation to the other target compounds, with peak O3 concentrations between April and June, and the second peak between August and October. It is also suggested that for O3, the 8-h standard is more stringent than the 1-h standard, while for NO2 and SO2, the 1-h standard is more stringent than the 24-h standard.

Objectives: To test whether airway effects occur below the current ozone standard and if they are more pronounced in potentially susceptible individuals, such as those deficient in the antioxidant gene glutathione S-transferase M1. 

Methods: Pulmonary function and subjective symptoms were measured in 59 healthy young adults (19-35 years) immediately before and after exposure to 0.0 (clean air, CA) and 0.06 ppm ozone for 6.6 hours in a chamber while undergoing intermittent moderate exercise. The polymorphonuclear neutrophil (PMN) influx was measured in 24 subjects 16-18 hour post-exposure 

Measurements and Main Results: Subjects experienced a significantly greater (p=0.008) change in FEV1 (?standard error) immediately following exposure to 0.06ppm ozone compared to CA (-1.76?0.50% vs. -0.002?0.46%). The decrement in FVC was also greater (p=0.02) after ozone vs. CA (-2.32?0.41% vs. -1.13?0.34%). Similarly, changes in %PMN were greater after ozone (54.0?4.6%) than CA (38.3?3.7%) exposure (p<0.001). Symptom scores were not different between ozone vs. CA. There were no significant differences in changes in FEV1, FVC and %PMN between subjects with GSTM1-positive and GSTM1-null genotypes. 

Conclusions: Exposure of healthy young adults to 0.06 ppm ozone for 6.6 hours causes a significant decrement of FEV1 and increase in neutrophilic inflammation in the airways.

It is being developed and used by research groups worldwide as a versatile tool for application to a wide range of atmospheric composition problems.

The GEOS data are available from the NASA Global Modeling Assimilation Office as a continuous archive from 1979 to present.  The most recent GEOS?5 product has a horizontal resolution of 0.5? latitude x 0.667? longitude, with 72 levels in the vertical. GEOS?Chem simulations can be conducted at the native resolution, at lower resolution, or in a nested mode with native resolution over selected regions. We have also adapted GEOS?Chem to run with climate data from the NASA/GISS general circulation model for simulations of atmospheric composition in past and future climates.

All current applications of the GEOS?Chem model use the same standard code maintained by Bob Yantosca, Philippe Le Sager, and Claire Carouge, with the choice between applications being controlled by logical switches.  Updated versions of this standard code are released regularly. Detailed GEOS?Chem on-line documentation is available including a User's Guide.  The code is fully modular and highly parallelized. It is being used on Sun, IBM, Linux, Ubuntu, Fedora, and CentOS cluster platforms.

An adjoint of the GEOS?Chem model is maintained by the GEOS?Chem community under the direction of Adjoint Model Scientist Daven Henze for inverse modeling, data assimilation, and sensitivity studies.

An IDL-based Global Atmospheric Modeling (output) Analysis Package (GAMAP) facilitates the visualization of GEOS?Chem model outputs.  GAMAP takes in 5-D model output fields (concentrations in 3-D space, time, tracer #) and through an user-friendly interface allows easy generation of a wide variety of plots and animations.  GAMAP was originally written by Martin Schultz and is being maintained and further developed by Bob Yantosca and Philippe Le Sager.

GEOS?Chem also contributes to the broader modeling community in several ways. It serves as an outer nest for several regional air quality models and has interfaces developed for that purpose. It has a column version that is integrated into general circulation models for chemical data assimilation or climate simulations. It has a highly modular structure to facilitate the swapping of code with other atmospheric composition models and the integration into Earth System models.

A statistical method was developed to extract baseline levels of ground level ozone in Canada and the US, and to quantify the temporal changes of baseline ozone levels on annual, seasonal, diurnal and decadal scales for the period 1997 to 2006 based on ground-level observations from 97 non-urban monitoring sites. Baseline ozone is defined here as ozone measured at a given site in the absence of strong local influences. The quantification of baseline levels involved using a Principal Component Analyses (PCA) to derive groups of commonly-varying sites in contiguous regions by season, followed by using backward air parcel trajectories to systematically select ozone mixing ratios associated with the baseline condition in each of the PCA-derived regions. Decadal trends were estimated by season for each of the regions using a generalized linear mixed model (GLMM).  Baseline ozone mixing ratios determined by this method were found to vary geographically and seasonally. For the 1997?2006 period, baseline mixing ratios were calculated for annual and seasonal periods in seven regions of North America based on multi-site multi-year averages of the baseline data sets. The annual average (?1 standard deviation) baseline mixing ratios for the regions are as follows: Continental Eastern Canada=30?9 ppb, Continental Eastern US=30?10 ppb, Coastal Eastern Canada=27?9 ppb, Coastal Western Canada=19?10 ppb; Coastal Western US=39?10 ppb, Continental Western Canada=28?10 ppb and Continental Western US=46?7 ppb. Trends in the baseline mixing ratios were also found to vary by season and by geographical region. On a decadal scale, increasing baseline ozone trends (temperature-adjusted) were observed in all seasons along the Pacific coasts of Canada and the US, although the trends in California were not statistically significant. In the coastal zone of Pacific Canada, positive trends were found with a rate of increase of 0.28?0.26, 0.72?0.55, and 0.93?0.41 ppb/a in spring (MAM), summer (JJA) and winter (DJF), respectively. In the Atlantic coastal region, the trends were also positive in 3 of the 4 seasons (but only significantly so in MAM). In the high ozone precursor emission areas of the Eastern United States, decadal trends in baseline ozone are, in general, negative in the spring, summer and fall and appear to be controlled by the strong within-region changes induced by decreasing ozone precursor emissions.",3.6.3.1,Multiyear Trends,0,0

Regional climate model scenarios developed by dynamically downscaling outputs from the GISS GCM are used by CMAQ to simulate present air pollution climatology, and modeled surface ozone mixing ratios are compared with recent observations. Though the model accurately simulates ozone in the northeast U.S. and in central California, a positive bias of 10?15 ppb exists throughout most of the central and southeast U.S. The model is also applied to a simulated 2050 climate based on the IPCC A1B greenhouse gas scenario. Two future simulations are conducted, one with anthropogenic emissions held at 2001 levels, and one with anthropogenic emissions reduced in accordance with the A1B scenario. Without ozone precursor emissions changes, increases from 2?5 ppb in summer mean 8-h ozone mixing ratios are projected in Texas and parts of the eastern U.S., while high ozone episodes become more frequent. Increases of 2?8 ppb during the autumn are predicted over a large area in the central and southwest U.S., suggesting a lengthening of the ozone season. These increases within the regional modeling domain are predicted despite large decreases in the future global background ozone mixing ratio. Substantial decreases exceeding 15 ppb during the summer are predicted for the future reduced emissions case. A sensitivity test conducted with 30% higher methane mixing ratio yields widespread ozone increases of 0.5?2 ppb, an effect larger than that of climate-induced increases in isoprene emissions, demonstrating the need to consider changes in methane levels alongside climate change when simulating future air quality.",3.3.1,Global Scale CTMs,0,0

The relationship between AQI media alerts and change in outdoor activities among people with asthma is unknown. Our objective is to examine this relationship. Data were analyzed in a cross-sectional study from 33,888 adults, in six states, who responded to the questions in the 2005 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) about reductions/changes in outdoor activity. The prevalence of change in outdoor activity due to media alerts was 31% among adults with lifetime asthma and 16% without asthma. The prevalence of outdoor activity change increased to 75% among those with lifetime asthma and to 68% without asthma, when the combined the effects of media alerts and individual perception were examined. The odds of activity change based on the media alerts was 2.30 (Adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 2.16, 95% Confidence interval [CI]: 1.61, 2.90) among those with lifetime asthma and 1.72 (aO R = 1.72, 95% CI: 1.50, 1.98) without asthma, compared to those unaware of media alerts, after adjustment for demographic variables and covariates. This study shows that awareness of media alerts as well as health professional advice may be associated with reported changes in outdoor activities.

As in many other communities across the country, a coalition of government agencies and businesses initiated a public information campaign in the Atlanta metropolitan region to reduce certain targeted behaviors, mainly driving. A two-stage model used to analyze data from a rolling sample survey shows that the centerpiece of the information campaign?air quality alerts?was effective in raising awareness and reducing driving in a segment of the population. When the overall information campaign was moderated by employers' participation in programs to improve air quality, drivers significantly reduced the number of miles they drove and the number of trips they took by car on days when air quality alerts were sounded.

Third-trimester estimates were generally higher in Hispanic and non-Hispanic black infants relative to non-Hispanic white infants. Distributed lag models were also suggestive of associations between air pollutant concentrations in late pregnancy and reduced birth weight.

We observe that a statistically significant trend at a specific monitoring site, using one exposure metric, does not necessarily result in a similar trend using the other two metrics. The two most common trends among the monitoring sites are either a continuation of negative trending over the 29-year period or a shift from negative to no trend status, indicating a leveling off of the trending. Very few sites exhibit statistically significant increases in the exposure indices. In characterizing the statistically significant changes in the distribution of hourly average O3, we observe subtle statistically significant changes in the lower part of the distribution (i.e., below 50 ppb) that are not necessarily captured by the trending patterns associated with the three exposure metrics. Using multisite data from 12 metropolitan cities, we find that as the frequency of higher hourly average concentrations is reduced, the lower hourly average concentrations also move upward toward the mid-level values. The change in the number of the hourly average concentrations in the lower range is consistent with decreased NO scavenging. We recommend assessing possible subtle shifts in O3 concentrations by characterizing changes in the distribution of hourly average concentrations by month. Identifying statistically significant monthly changes in the mid- and low-level hourly average concentrations may provide important information for assessing changes in physical processes associated with global climate change, long-range transport, and the efficacy of models used for emission and risk reductions. Our results indicate that it is important to investigate the change in the trending pattern with time (e.g., moving 15-year trending) in order to assess how year-to-year variability may influence the trend calculation.",3.6.3.1,Multiyear Trends,0,0

In the presence of multiple monitoring stations at different locations, the selection of them may affect the observed epidemiological concentration-response (C-R) relationships. In this paper, we quantify these impacts in an observational ecologic case-crossover study of air pollution and mortality. The associations of daily concentrations of PM(10), O(3), and NO(2) with daily all-cause non-violent mortality were investigated using conditional logistic regression to estimate percent increase in the risk of dying for an increase of 10??g/m(3) in the previous day air pollutant concentrations (lag 1). The study area covers the six main cities in the central-western part of Emilia-Romagna region (population of 1.1 million). We used four approaches to assign exposure to air pollutants for each individual considered in the study: nearest background station; city average of all stations available; average of all stations in a macro-area covering three cities and average of all six cities in the study area (50 ? 150?km(2)). Odds ratios generally increased enlarging the spatial dimension of the exposure definition and were highest for six city-average exposure definition. The effect is especially evident for PM(10), and similar for NO(2), whereas for ozone, we did not find any change in the C-R estimates. Within a geographically homogeneous region, the spatial aggregation of monitoring station data leads to higher and more robust risk estimates for PM(10) and NO(2), even if monitor-to-monitor correlations showed a light decrease with distance. We suggest that the larger aggregation improves the representativity of the exposure estimates by decreasing exposure misclassification, which is more profound when using individual stations vs regional averages.",4.6.2.1,Spatial Variability,0,0

Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) is involved in ozone (O3)-induced pulmonary hyperpermeability and inflammation, though the downstream signaling events are unknown. Objectives. The aims of our study were to determine the mechanism through which TLR4 modulates O3-induced pulmonary responses and to utilize transcriptomics to determine potential TLR4 effector molecules. Methods. C3H/HeJ (HeJ; Tlr4 mutant) and C3H/HeOuJ (OuJ; Tlr4 normal) mice were exposed continuously to 0.3 ppm O3 or filtered air for 6, 24, 48 or 72 hr. Inflammation was assessed by bronchoalveolar lavage and molecular analysis by mRNA microarray, quantitative RT-PCR, immunoblots, immunostaining, and ELISAs. Results. O3-induced TLR4 signaling occurred through MYD88-dependent and independent pathways in OuJ mice, and involved multiple downstream pathways. Genome-wide transcript analyses of air- and O3-exposed HeJ and OuJ lungs identified a significantly upregulated cluster of genes in OuJ mice compared to HeJ mice or air that included heat shock proteins (e.g. Hspa1b; Hsp70). Furthermore, O3-induced expression of HSP70 protein was significantly increased in OuJ compared to HeJ mice. Moreover, O3-induced inflammation and MYD88 upregulation, ERK1/2 and AP-1 activation, and KC protein content were significantly reduced in Hspa1a/Hspa1btm1Dix (Hsp70-/-) compared to Hsp70+/+ mice (p<0.05). Conclusions. These studies suggest that HSP70 is an effector molecule downstream of TLR4, and is involved in the regulation of O3-induced lung inflammation by triggering similar pathways to TLR4.

Besides the well-described respiratory tract inflammation and dysfunctions, there is accumulating evidence indicating that O(3) exposure affects brain functions. However, the mechanisms through which O(3) exerts toxic effects on the brain remain poorly understood. This work aimed at precisely characterizing CNS neuronal activation after O(3) inhalation using Fos staining in adult rat. We showed that, together with lung inflammation, O(3) exposure caused a sustained time- and dose-dependent neuronal activation in the dorsolateral regions of the nucleus tractus solitarius overlapping terminal fields of lung afferents running in vagus nerves. Furthermore, we highlighted neuronal activation in interconnected central structures such as the caudal ventrolateral medulla, the parabrachial nucleus, the central nucleus of the amygdala, the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis and the paraventricular hypothalamic nucleus. In contrast, we did not detect any neuronal activation in the thoracic spinal cord where lung afferents running in spinal nerves terminate. Overall, our results demonstrate that O(3) challenge evokes a lung inflammation that induces the activation of nucleus tractus solitarius neurons through the vagus nerves and promotes neuronal activation in stress-responsive regions of the CNS.",5.3.2,Activation of Neural Reflexes,5.1.2,Biological Plausibility

The results showed that O(3) exposure for 5 or 10 cycles increased the TGF-? protein level in the epithelial lining fluid (ELF), associated with an increase in the expression of plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 (PAI-1), a TGF-?-responsive gene that plays a critical role in the development of fibrosis under various pathological conditions. Cyclic O(3) exposure also increased the deposition of collagens and alpha smooth muscle actin (?-SMA) in airway walls. However, these fibrotic changes were not overt until after 10 cycles of O(3) exposure. Importantly, blockage of the TGF-? signaling pathway with IN-1233 suppressed O(3)-induced Smad2/3 phosphorylation, PAI-1 expression, as well as collagens and ?-SMA deposition in the lung.

Experiments were conducted at typical room temperatures and air exchange rates. Limonene ozonolysis produced the highest SOA mass concentrations and linalool the lowest with ?-pinene being intermediate. Simplified empirical modeling simulations were conducted to provide insights into reaction chemistry. Assessment of variability of particle-bound reactive oxygen species (ROS) may be important in the understanding of health effects associated with particulate matter. The ROS intensities defined as ROS/SOA mass were found to be moderately correlated with the SOA densities. Greater ROS intensities were observed for the cases where ozone was in excess. ROS intensities approached a relatively constant value in the region where ozone was in deficit. The estimated initial ROS half-life time was approximately 6.5 h at room temperature suggesting the time sensitivity of ROS measurements. The ROS formed from terpenoid ozonolysis could be separated into three categories: short-lived/high reactive/volatile, semivolatile/relatively stable and nonvolatile/low reactive species based on ROS measurements under various conditions.

Objective: To examine the relationships between airway purine metabolites and established inflammatory markers of ozone exposure, and to determine if these relationships are altered in individuals with atopy or asthma. Materials and methods: Mass spectrometry was utilized to measure concentrations of purine metabolites (adenosine monophosphate [AMP], adenosine, hypoxanthine, uric acid) and non-purine metabolites (taurine, urea, phenylalanine, tyrosine) in induced sputum obtained from 31 subjects with normal lung function (13 healthy controls, eight atopic nonasthmatics, and 10 atopic asthmatic [AA]) before and 4?h after ozone exposure. Results: At baseline, the purines AMP and hypoxanthine correlated with multiple inflammatory markers including neutrophil counts and the cytokines interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-?), and IL-1? (r ranged from 0.41 to 0.66, all P?&lt;?0.05). Following ozone exposure, these purines remained correlated with IL-6, IL-8, and TNF-? (r?=?0.37-0.68). However, AMP and hypoxanthine increased significantly post ozone exposure in atopic nonasthmatics but not in AA. In contrast, the non-purine metabolite taurine correlated with baseline neutrophil counts (r?=?0.56) and IL-6 (r?=?0.53) and was elevated post-exposure in both atopic cohorts. Discussion and conclusions: The purine metabolites AMP and hypoxanthine are correlated with multiple inflammatory markers at baseline and after ozone exposure. However, changes in these purine metabolites after ozone appear to differ from other inflammatory markers, with less response in AA relative to atopic nonasthmatics.

The coincidences between the number of days with a daily maximum hourly average O3 concentration ? 50 ppb and stratosphere-to-troposphere transport to surface (STT-S > 0) were quantified. The high-elevation site at Yellowstone National Park (NP) in Wyoming exhibited the most coincidences (i.e., more than 19 days a month) during the spring and summer for hourly average O3 concentrations ? 50 ppb with STT-S > 0 of the 12 monitoring sites. At this site, the daily maximum hourly springtime average O3 concentrations were usually in the 60?70 ppb range. The maximum daily 8-h average concentrations mostly ranged from 50 to 65 ppb. At many of the lower-elevation sites, there was a preference for O3 enhancements to be coincident with STT-S > 0 during the springtime, although summertime occurrences were sometimes observed. When statistically significant coincidences occurred, the daily maximum hourly average concentrations were mostly in the 50?65 ppb range and the daily maximum 8-h average concentrations were usually in the 50?62 ppb range. For many cases, the coincidences between the enhancements and the STT-S events occurred over a continuous multiday period. Supplementary observations, such as (1) the greater frequency of O3 concentration enhancements occurring during the springtime versus other times of the year, (2) the elevation dependency of the frequency of enhancements, (3) the year-to-year variability, (4) the timing of the hour-by-hour occurrences of the O3 concentration enhancements within and across monitoring sites, and (5) the detailed analyses of O3 enhancement events at specific sites, provide additional support for our modeling and statistical results.

Using this criteria, the OMI data indicate that ozone formation became: 1. more sensitive to NOx over most of the United States from 2005 to 2007 because of the substantial decrease in NOx emissions, primarily from stationary sources, and the concomitant decrease in the tropospheric column of NO2, and 2. more sensitive to NOx with increasing temperature, in part because emissions of highly reactive, biogenic isoprene increase with temperature, thus increasing the total VOC reactivity. In cities with relatively low isoprene emissions (e.g., Chicago), the data clearly indicate that ozone formation became more sensitive to NOx from 2005 to 2007.

Eulerian chemical transport models (CTMs) have difficulty reproducing these layered structures due to numerical plume dissipation. We show that this dissipation is much faster than would be expected from the order of the advection scheme because of interaction between numerical diffusion and the nonuniformity of the atmospheric flow. The nonuniform flow stretches out the plume, enhancing the effect of numerical diffusion. For sufficiently strong stretching, the numerical decay of the plume is independent of the model grid resolution and is set instead by the flow Lyapunov exponent ?. In this regime, conventional numerical methods are not convergent: upon increasing grid resolution, the plume still decays with the same decay rate. The critical plume size below which the numerical scheme does not converge is set by the geometric mean of the grid spacing and the characteristic length scale l = v/? over which the flow varies, where v is the wind speed. Above this critical plume size the numerically induced decay rate of the plume scales like the square root of the grid spacing.

Monitor locations were also analyzed with respect to a socioeconomic status index developed by the municipal government. Hourly PM10 and O3 data for the S?o Paulo Municipality and Metropolitan Region (1999-2006) were used to evaluate heterogeneity by comparing distance between monitors with pollutants' correlations and coefficients of divergence (CODs). Both pollutants showed high correlations across monitoring sites (median = 0.8 for daily averages). CODs across sites averaged 0.20. Distance was a good predictor of CODs for PM10 (p < 0.01) but not O3, whereas distance was a good predictor of correlations for O3 (p < 0.01) but not PM10. High COD values and low temporal correlation indicate a spatially heterogeneous distribution of PM10.

Exposure to carbon monoxide, nitrogen dioxide, ozone, sulfur dioxide, and particulate matter was determined using data obtained from fixed-site air pollution monitors operated principally in urban areas. Four different methods of attributing pollution exposure were used based on residence in (1) 1980, (2) 1994, (3) 1980 and 1994, and (4) at all locations between 1980 and 2002. Between 1,693 and 4,274 of 10,515 members of the cohort could be assigned exposures to individual pollutants using these methods. On average, subjects spent 71.4% of the 1980-2002 period in the census subdivision where they lived in 1980. A single exposure measure in 1980 or 1994 or a mean of the two measures was highly correlated (r&gt;0.7, P&lt;0.0001) with a measure which accounted for all moves between 1980 and 2002.

Indeed, in most instances, the metabolic cost of ventilation represents the only significant contribution of the pulmonary system to the limitation of O2 transport of locomotor muscles and thus to the limitation of maximum performance. Of the ""weaknesses"" inherent in the healthy pulmonary system response to exercise, the most serious one may well be its absence of structural adaptability to physical training or to the trained state. Thus, the lung's diffusion capacity and pulmonary capillary blood volume remain unaltered in the highly trained human or horse, while maximum pulmonary blood flow rises linearly with the enhanced max VO2. Similarly, ventilatory requirement rises markedly, with no alteration in the capability of the airways to produce higher flow rates or of the lung parenchyma to stretch to higher tidal volumes, and little or no change in the pressure-generating capability of inspiratory muscles. The case of the elderly athlete who remains capable of achieving high maximum pulmonary blood flows and ventilatory requirements and whose lung undergoes a normal aging process underscores the importance of deficits (from ""normal"") on the capacity end of this continuum of cost versus capacity in the pulmonary system. The asthmatic athlete may represent another such example of limited flow-generating capacity; and the healthy, young, highly fit athlete who shows marked reductions in SaO2 and in max VO2 at even moderately high altitudes demonstrates that, in many situations, precious little room can be added to the demand side or removed from the capacity side before signs of failure can be seen.",5.2.2.7,Physical Activity,0,0

First, flow limitation in intrathoracic airways may occur during exercise because of narrowed, hyperactive airways or secondary to excessive ventilatory demands superimposed on a normal maximum flow-volume envelope. Narrowing of the extrathoracic, upper airway also occurs in some athletes at very high flow rates during heavy exercise. Examination of the breath-by-breath tidal flow-volume loop during exercise is key to a noninvasive diagnosis of flow limitation and to differentiation between intrathoracic and extrathoracic airway narrowing. Second exercise-induced arterial hypoxemia occurs secondary to an excessively widened alveolar-arterial oxygen pressure difference. This inefficient gas exchange may be attributable in part to small intracardiac or intrapulmonary shunts of deoxygenated mixed venous blood during exercise. The existence of these shunts at rest and during exercise may be determined by using saline solution contrast echocardiography. Finally, fatigue of the respiratory muscles resulting from sustained, high-intensity exercise and the resultant vasoconstrictor effects on limb muscle vasculature will also compromise O(2) transport and performance. Exercise in the hypoxic environments of even moderately high altitudes will greatly exacerbate the negative influences of these respiratory system limitations to exercise performance, especially in highly fit individuals.",5.2.2.7,Physical Activity,0,0

In this work, the four stereoisomers of these tetraols were analyzed in aerosols from Aspvreten, Sweden. 2-C-methyl-D-erythritol was found in excess over its enantiomer in the Spring/Summer, by up to 29% in July. This clearly indicated some biological origins for this enantiomer, consistent with its well-documented production by plants and other living organisms.

Our work improves on previous GEOS-Chem PRB estimates through the use of higher model resolution, 3-year statistics, better representation of stratospheric influence, and updated emissions. PRB is particularly high in the intermountain West due to high elevation, arid terrain, and large-scale subsidence. We present for this region a detailed model evaluation showing that the model is successful in reproducing ozone exceedances up to 70 ppbv. However, the model cannot reproduce PRB-relevant exceptional events associated with wildfires or stratospheric intrusions. The mean PRB estimates for spring?summer are 27 ? 8 ppbv at low-altitude sites and 40 ? 7 ppbv at high-altitude sites. Differences between the PRB simulation and the natural simulation indicate a mean enhancement from intercontinental pollution and anthropogenic methane of 9 ppbv at low-altitude sites and 13 ppbv at high-altitude sites. The PRB is higher than average when ozone exceeds 60 ppbv, particularly in the intermountain West. Our PRB estimates are on average 4 ppbv higher than previous GEOS-Chem studies and we attribute this to higher lighting, increasing Asian emissions, and improved model resolution. Whereas previous studies found no occurrences of PRB exceeding 60 ppbv, we find here some occurrences in the intermountain West. The annual 4th-highest PRB values in the intermountain West are typically 50?60 ppbv, as compared to 35?45 ppbv in the East or on the West Coast.

RESULT(S): ROS plays an essential role in the pathogenesis of many reproductive processes. In male-factor infertility. oxidative stress attacks the fluidity of the sperm plasma membrane and the integrity of DNA in the sperm nucleus. Reactive oxygen species induced DNA damage may accelerate the process of germ cell apoptosis, leading to the decline in sperm counts associated with male infertility. ROS mediated female fertility disorders share many pathogenic similarities with the ones on the male side. These similarities include a potential role in the pathophysiology of endometriosis and unexplained infertility. High follicular fluid ROS levels are associated with negative IVF outcomes, particularly in smokers. Moreover, oxidative stress may be responsible in hydrosalpingeal fluid mediated embryotoxicity as well as poor in vitro embryonic development.

Nitrotyrosine residues, which are a marker of peroxynitrite formation and action, are found in placental vessels of preeclamptic and diabetic pregnancies, indicating oxidative stress. Treatment of the placental vasculature with authentic peroxynitrite in vitro attenuates responses both to vasoconstrictors such as the thromboxane mimetic U46619 and to vasodilators, including glyceryl trinitrate and prostacyclin, indicating it has caused vascular dysfunction. Further, the responses of the fetal-placental vasculature of diabetic and preeclamptic placentae to these same vasoconstrictor and vasodilator agents are significantly attenuated when compared to responses in normal control placentae. Together these data suggest there may be a cause and effect relationship between formation and action of peroxynitrite and vascular dysfunction in the placenta of both preeclamptic and diabetic pregnancies.

The site of ROS-mediated inhibition of steroidogenesis in the corpus luteum and MA-10 tumor Leydig cells was shown to be the hormone-sensitive mitochondrial cholesterol transfer step. The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of ROS on steroidogenic acute regulatory (StAR) protein in MA-10 cells and determine the extent to which MA-10 cell mitochondria are sensitive to oxidative stress. cAMP-stimulated progesterone production was inhibited in a dose-dependent manner in MA-10 cells exposed to H(2)O(2). StAR protein, but not mRNA levels, was decreased in parallel to changes in progesterone production. Even at the highest concentrations of H(2)O(2) tested, there was no effect on P450 side-chain cleavage enzyme protein levels. Oxidative stress from exposure to exogenous xanthine oxidase and xanthine resulted in the inhibition of both progesterone production and StAR protein expression. The mature 30- and 32-kDa intramitochondrial forms of StAR were decreased relative to the 37-kDa extramitochondrial precursor form of StAR, indicating that the ROS-mediated inhibition of StAR protein was due, in part, to the inhibition of mitochondrial import and processing. Vital staining with the fluorescent dye tetramethylrhodamine ethyl ester was used to visualize changes in the mitochondrial electrochemical gradient-dependent membrane potential (Deltapsim). ROS caused a significant dissipation of Deltapsi(m) and time-dependent loss of tetramethylrhodamine ethyl ester fluorescence. The inhibitory effects of H(2)O(2) were transient. There was no evidence for ROS-induced cell death, and following H(2)O(2) removal in the presence of continuous treatment with 8-bromo-cAMP, StAR protein levels and progesterone production were restored. In addition, there was no loss of cell viability following treatment with H(2)O(2) or xanthine/xanthine oxidase as determined by trypan blue exclusion. H(2)O(2) did not cause a significant decrease in total cellular ATP levels. These data indicate that oxidative stress-mediated perturbation of the mitochondria and dissipation of Deltapsi(m) results in the inhibition of StAR protein expression and its import, processing, and cholesterol transfer activity. These findings confirm earlier studies demonstrating the requirement for maintenance of an intact Deltapsi(m) for StAR protein function in cholesterol transport. The significant reduction in the 32- to 30-kDa mature forms of StAR, cessation of cholesterol transport, and loss of Deltapsi(m) are consistent with mitochondrial perturbation because of oxidative stress.

Two statistics, ""D"" and ""A"", are targeted. The D statistic reflects the relative importance of within- and between-person variance with respect to the key variable. The A statistic quantifies the day-to-day (lag-one) autocorrelation. The user selects appropriate target values for both D and A. The new method then stochastically assembles longitudinal diaries that collectively meet these targets. On the basis of numerous simulations, the D and A targets are closely attained for exposure analysis periods >30 days in duration, and reasonably well for shorter simulation periods. Longitudinal diary data from a field study suggest that D and A are stable over time, and perhaps over cohorts as well. The new method can be used with any cohort definitions and diary pool assignments, making it easily adaptable to most exposure models. Implementation of the new method in its basic form is described, and various extensions beyond the basic form are discussed.",4.5.3,Microenvironment-Based Models,0,0

The main purpose of the paper is to understand intra- and inter-variability in the time spent by the sample in the outdoor location, the location exhibiting the most variability of the ones evaluated. The data were analyzed using distribution-free hypothesis-testing (K-S tests of the distributions), generalized linear modeling techniques, and random-sampling schemes that produced ""cohorts"" whose descriptive statistical characteristics were evaluated against the original dataset. Most importantly, our analyses indicate that subdividing the population into appropriate cohorts better replicates parameters of the original data, including the interclass correlation coefficient (ICC), which is a relative measure of the intra- and inter-individual variability inherent in the original data. While the findings of our analyses are consistent with previous assessments of ""time budget"" and physical activity data, they are constrained by the rather homogeneous sample available to us. Owing to a general lack of longitudinal human activity/location data available for other age/gender cohorts, we are unable to generalize our findings to other population subgroups.",4.4.1,Activity Patterns,0,0

Additional challenges include determining what scientific tools are available and most relevant, and understanding how to use those tools; given these barriers, community groups tend to rely more on risk perception than science. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's Office of Research and Development, National Exposure Research Laboratory (NERL) and collaborators are developing and applying tools (models, data, methods) for enhancing cumulative risk assessments. The NERL's ""Cumulative Communities Research Program"" focuses on key science questions: (1) How to systematically identify and prioritize key chemical stressors within a given community?; (2) How to develop estimates of exposure to multiple stressors for individuals in epidemiologic studies?; and (3) What tools can be used to assess community-level distributions of exposures for the development and evaluation of the effectiveness of risk reduction strategies? This paper provides community partners and scientific researchers with an understanding of the NERL research program and other efforts to address cumulative community risks; and key research needs and opportunities. Some initial findings include the following: (1) Many useful tools exist for components of risk assessment, but need to be developed collaboratively with end users and made more comprehensive and user-friendly for practical application; (2) Tools for quantifying cumulative risks and impact of community risk reduction activities are also needed; (3) More data are needed to assess community- and individual-level exposures, and to link exposure-related information with health effects; and (4) Additional research is needed to incorporate risk-modifying factors (""non-chemical stressors"") into cumulative risk assessments.

Impacts of measurement error in epidemiologic studies of ambient air pollution are expected to depend on error type. We characterize measurement error due to instrument imprecision and spatial variability as multiplicative (i.e. additive on the log scale) and model it over a range of error types to assess impacts on risk ratio estimates both on a per measurement unit basis and on a per interquartile range (IQR) basis in a time-series study in Atlanta.<br /><br /> Methods: Daily measures of twelve ambient air pollutants were analyzed: NO2, NOx, O3, SO2, CO, PM10 mass, PM2.5 mass, and PM2.5 components sulfate, nitrate, ammonium, elemental carbon and organic carbon. Semivariogram analysis was applied to assess spatial variability. Error due to this spatial variability was added to a reference pollutant time-series on the log scale using Monte Carlo simulations. Each of these time-series was exponentiated and introduced to a Poisson generalized linear model of cardiovascular disease emergency department visits.<br /><br />Results: Measurement error resulted in reduced statistical significance for the risk ratio estimates for all amounts (corresponding to different pollutants) and types of error. When modelled as classical-type error, risk ratios were attenuated, particularly for primary air pollutants, with average attenuation in risk ratios on a per unit of measurement basis ranging from 18% to 92% and on an IQR basis ranging from 18% to 86%. When modelled as Berkson-type error, risk ratios per unit of measurement were biased away from the null hypothesis by 2% to 31%, whereas risk ratios per IQR were attenuated (i.e. biased toward the null) by 5% to 34%. For CO modelled error amount, a range of error types were simulated and effects on risk ratio bias and significance were observed.<br /><br />Conculsions: For multiplicative error, both the amount and type of measurement error impact health effect estimates in air pollution epidemiology.

Data Sources: A systematic and comprehensive literature search was conducted in 14 electronic databases (Diagnosis) and the Cochrane Airways Register (Therapy).

Review Methods: Study selection, quality assessment, and data extraction were conducted independently by two reviewers. The primary outcome was the maximum percent fall in the post-exercise forced expiratory volume in 1 second (percent fall FEV1). The diagnostic threshold for a positive ECT was a percent fall FEV1 of 10% or more. Sensitivity (SN) and specificity (SP) were calculated. For therapy, mean differences (MD) in the percent fall FEV1 and 95% confidence intervals (CI) (random effects model) were calculated. A positive MD indicates the intervention works better than the control.

Results: For the diagnostic reviews, 5,318 citations yielded 28 relevant studies; for the therapy reviews, 1,634 citations yielded 109 relevant RCTs. Diagnostic test results versus ECT: self-reported history (2 studies) SN=36-8 percent; SP=85-86 percent; sport specific challenges (5 studies) SN=0-100 percent, SP=0-100 percent; eucapnic voluntary hyperpnea (7 studies) SN=25-90 percent, SP=0-71 percent; free running asthma screening test (3 studies) SN=60-67 percent, SP=47-67 percent; mannitol (3 studies) SN=58-96 percent, SP=65-78 percent. All SN and SP calculations indicated substantial heterogeneity that could not be explained by sensitivity or subgroup analyses. Therapy results: SABA offered greater protection than mast cell stabilizers (MCS) (12 studies); MD=6.8 (95 percent CI: 4.5, 9.2) but combining them offered no additional benefit; SABA versus MCS plus SABA (5 studies) MD=1.3 (95 percent CI: -6.3, 8.9). Leukotriene receptor antagonists (LTRA), MCS, ipratropium bromide, and interval warmup routines provided statistically significant attenuation of EIA when compared with placebo; inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) and other warmup routines did not. Single-dose intervention versus placebo results are: LTRA (9 studies) MD=8.9 (95 percent CI: 6.9, 11.0); MCS (nedocromil sodium) (17 studies) MD=15.6 (95 percent CI: 13.2, 18.2); interval warmup versus no warmup (4 studies) MD=10.6 (95 percent CI: 6.5, 14.7); ICS (4 studies) MD=5.0 (95 percent CI: 0.0, 9.9); continuous low intensity warmup versus no warmup (3 studies) MD=12.6 (95 percent CI: -1.5, 26.7); continuous high intensity warmup versus no warmup (2 studies) MD=9.8 (95 percent CI: -6.4, 26.0). After daily LABA (salmeterol) use for 3 to 4 weeks (4 studies), the percent fall FEV1 following an ECT at 2 and 4 weeks was greater than at day 1 in the LABA arm indicating that tachyphylaxis to prophylactic LABA use occurred. Daily SABA use for 1 week (1 study) also indicated development of tachyphylaxis. However, both LABA and SABA continued to have an attenuating effect on EIA.

Conclusions: Given the small number of studies comparing EIB/EIA diagnostic tests, the heterogeneity of the study populations, and the varied study methodologies, there is no clear evidence that any of the index tests are a suitable replacement for a standardized ECT to diagnose EIB/EIA in the general population. All bronchodilator agents and most anti-inflammatory agents when used as pretreatment are somewhat effective in attenuating the percent fall FEV1 associated with EIA.",6.2.1.1,Controlled Human Exposure,0,0

We employ data collected from 1978 as reported in 41 roadside monitoring studies, encompassing more than 700 air pollutant concentration measurements, published as of June 2008. Two types of normalization, background and edge-of-road, were applied to the observed concentrations. Local regression models were specified to the concentration-distance relationship and analysis of variance was used to determine the statistical significance of trends. Using an edge-of-road normalization, almost all pollutants decay to background by 115-570 m from the edge of road; using the more standard background normalization, almost all pollutants decay to background by 160-570 m from the edge of road. Differences between the normalization methods arose due to the likely bias inherent in background normalization, since some reported background values tend to underpredict (be lower than) actual background. Changes in pollutant concentrations with increasing distance from the road fell into one of three groups: at least a 50% decrease in peak/edge-of-road concentration by 150 m, followed by consistent but gradual decay toward background (e.g., carbon monoxide, some ultrafine particulate matter number concentrations); consistent decay or change over the entire distance range (e.g., benzene, nitrogen dioxide); or no trend with distance (e.g., particulate matter mass concentrations).",4.3.3,Personal-Ambient Concentration Relationships,0,0

Modeling indicated that North American pollution plumes impacted the California coast primarily below 3 km, but had no measurable impact on the average coastal ozone profiles. Vertical and latitudinal variation in free tropospheric baseline ozone appears to be partly explained by polluted and stratospheric air masses that descend isentropically along the west coast. Above 3 km, the dominant sources of ozone precursors were China and international shipping, while international shipping was the greatest source below 2 km. Approximately 8-10% of the baseline ozone that enters California in the 0-6 km range impacts the surface of the USA, but very little reaches the eastern USA. Within California, the major impact of baseline ozone above 2 km is on the high elevation terrain of eastern California.

Here, we identify the role of two key reactive intermediates, epoxydiols of isoprene (IEPOX = beta-IEPOX + delta-IEPOX) and methacryloylperoxynitrate (MPAN), which are formed during isoprene oxidation under low- and high-NO(x) conditions, respectively. Isoprene low-NO(x) SOA is enhanced in the presence of acidified sulfate seed aerosol (mass yield 28.6%) over that in the presence of neutral aerosol (mass yield 1.3%). Increased uptake of IEPOX by acid-catalyzed particle-phase reactions is shown to explain this enhancement. Under high-NO(x) conditions, isoprene SOA formation occurs through oxidation of its second-generation product, MPAN. The similarity of the composition of SOA formed from the photooxidation of MPAN to that formed from isoprene and methacrolein demonstrates the role of MPAN in the formation of isoprene high-NO(x) SOA.

The causes of NO(x) underpredictions have yet to be fully understood due to the interconnected nature of simulated emission, transport, and chemistry processes. Recent observation-based studies, in the upper troposphere, identify chemical rate coefficients as a potential source of error (Olson et al., 2006; Ren et al., 2008). Since typical chemistry evaluation techniques are not available for upper tropospheric conditions, this study develops an evaluation platform from in situ observations, stochastic convection, and deterministic chemistry. We derive a stochastic convection model and optimize it using two simulated datasets of time since convection, one based on meteorology, and the other on chemistry. The chemistry surrogate for time since convection is calculated using seven different chemical mechanisms, all of which predict shorter time since convection than our meteorological analysis. We evaluate chemical simulations by inter-comparison and by pairing results with observations based on NO(x):HNO(3), a photochemical aging indicator. Inter-comparison reveals individual chemical mechanism biases and recommended updates.

Laboratory studies show significant variation in the rate of uptake, with a general decline in the value of ?N2O5 over the last decade as increasingly relevant tropospheric proxies have been studied. In order to understand the implication of this decline for tropospheric composition, a global model of tropospheric chemistry and transport (GEOS-Chem) is run with differing values of ?N2O5 (0.0, 10?10?6, 10?10?4, 10?3, 5?10?3, 10?2, 2?10?10?2, 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, and 1.0). We identify three regimes in the model response. At low values of ?N2O5, the model shows reduced sensitivity to the value of ?N2O5 as heterogeneous uptake of ?N2O5 does not provide a significant pathway to perturb NOx burdens. At high values of ?N2O5 the model again shows reduced sensitivity to the value of ?N2O5, as NOx loss through heterogeneous removal of ?N2O5 is limited by the rate of production of NO3, rather than the rate of heterogeneous uptake. At intermediate values of ?N2O5 the model shows significant sensitivity to the value of ?N2O5. We find regional differences in the model's response to changing ?N2O5. Regions with high aerosol surface area and low temperatures show NO3 production becoming rate limiting at lower ?N2O5 values than regions with lower aerosol surface area and higher temperatures. The northern extra-tropics show significant sensitivity to the value of ?N2O5 at values consistent with current literature (0.001?0.02), thus an accurate description of ?N2O5 is required for adequate simulation of O3 burdens and long-range transport of pollutants in this region.

Our model simulations also provide insight into the sensitivity of coupled chemistry-aerosol simulations to the choice of ?N2O5. We find little change in the global sensitivity of NOx, O3 and OH to ?N2O5 in the range 0.05 to 1.0, but a significant drop in sensitivity below this range.

Sensitivity calculations were conducted to assess effects of varying HONO inputs, ambient VOC speciation, and changing treatments of temperature and lighting conditions. The locations modeled were found to be quite different in VOC speciation and sensitivities to VOC and NOx emissions, with one site modeled for the 2008 episode being highly NOx-sensitive and insensitive to VOCs and HONO, and the other 2008 site and both 2011 sites being very sensitive to changes in VOC and HONO inputs. Incremental reactivity scales calculated for VOC-sensitive conditions in the UGRB predict far lower relative contributions of alkanes to ozone formation than in the traditional urban-based MIR scale and that the major contributors to ozone formation were the alkenes and the aromatics, despite their relatively small mass contributions. The reactivity scales are affected by the variable ambient VOC speciation and uncertainties in ambient HONO levels. These box model calculations are useful for indicating general sensitivities and reactivity characteristics of these winter UGRB episodes, but fully three-dimensional models will be required to assess ozone abatement strategies in the UGRB.

PRB enters into the calculation of health risk benefits, and as the US ozone standard approaches background levels, PRB is increasingly important in determining the feasibility and cost of compliance. As PRB is a hypothetical construct, modeling is a necessary tool. Since 2006 EPA has relied on global modeling to establish PRB for their regulatory analyses. Recent assessments with higher resolution global models exhibit improved agreement with remote observations and modest upward shifts in PRB estimates. This paper shifts the paradigm to a regional model (CAMx) run at 12 km resolution, for which North American boundary conditions were provided by a low-resolution version of the GEOS-Chem global model. We conducted a comprehensive model inter-comparison, from which we elucidate differences in predictive performance against ozone observations and differences in temporal and spatial background variability over the US. In general, CAMx performed better in replicating observations at remote monitoring sites, and performance remained better at higher concentrations. While spring and summer mean PRB predicted by GEOS-Chem ranged 20-45 ppb, CAMx predicted PRB ranged 25-50 ppb and reached well over 60 ppb in the west due to event-oriented phenomena such as stratospheric intrusion and wildfires. CAMx showed a higher correlation between modeled PRB and total observed ozone, which is significant for health risk assessments. A case study during April 2006 suggests that stratospheric exchange of ozone is underestimated in both models on an event basis. We conclude that wildfires, lightning NO and stratospheric intrusions contribute a significant level of uncertainty in estimating PRB, and that PRB will require careful consideration in the ozone standard setting process.

We first produce a monthly climatology for each site over all available years, defined as the slope of the best-fit line (m(O3-T)) between monthly average values of maximum daily 8-hour average (MDA8) O-3 and monthly average values of daily maximum surface temperature (T-max). Applying two distinct statistical approaches to aggregate the site-specific measurements to the regional scale, we find that summer time m(O3-T) is 3-6 ppb K-1 (r = 0.5-0.8) over the Northeast, 3-4 ppb K-1 (r = 0.5-0.9) over the Great Lakes, and 3-6 ppb K-1 (r = 0.2-0.8) over the Mid-Atlantic. The Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory (GFDL) Atmospheric Model version 3 (AM3) global chemistry-climate model generally captures the seasonal variations in correlation coefficients and m(O3-T) despite biases in both monthly mean summertime MDA8 O-3 (up to +10 to +30 ppb) and daily T-max (up to +5 K) over the eastern US. During summer, GFDL AM3 reproduces m(O3-T) over the Northeast (m(O3-T) = 2-6 ppb K-1; r = 0.6-0.9), but underestimates m(O3-T) by 4 ppb K-1 over the Mid-Atlantic, in part due to excessively warm temperatures above which O-3 production saturates in the model. Combining T-max biases in GFDL AM3 with an observation-based m(O3-T) estimate of 3 ppb K-1 implies that temperature biases could explain up to 5-15 ppb of the MDA8 O-3 bias in August and September though correcting for excessively cool temperatures would worsen the O-3 bias in June.

The method successfully reproduces the results of full simulations with these models. For a given emission scenario it provides the ensemble mean surface ozone change, a regional source attribution for each change, and an estimate of the associated uncertainty as represented by the variation between models. Using the Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) emission scenarios as an example, we show how regional surface ozone is likely to respond to emission changes by 2050 and how changes in precursor emissions and atmospheric methane contribute to this. Surface ozone changes are substantially smaller than expected with the SRES A1B, A2 and B2 scenarios, with annual global mean reductions of as much as 2 ppb by 2050 vs. increases of 4-6 ppb under SRES, and this reflects the assumptions of more stringent precursor emission controls under the RCP scenarios. We find an average difference of around 5 ppb between the outlying RCP 2.6 and RCP 8.5 scenarios, about 75% of which can be attributed to differences in methane abundance. The study reveals the increasing importance of limiting atmospheric methane growth as emissions of other precursors are controlled, but highlights differences in modelled ozone responses to methane changes of as much as a factor of two, indicating that this remains a major uncertainty in current models.",3.4.3.1,Updated GEOS-Chem Model Estimates of Background Concentrations,0,0

Wildfires are a source of tropospheric O3, and studies show that wildfires are increasing in North America. In this study, we present a critical review of O3 production from wildfires focusing on three key topics: the influence of wildfire emissions on O3 production; the influence of photochemistry on wildfire O3 production; and regulatory issues associated with wildfire O3 production in the United States. Observations of ?O3/?CO range from approximately ?0.1 to 0.9, and are caused by the interplay of numerous factors including fire emissions, efficiency of combustion, chemical and photochemical reactions, aerosol effects on chemistry and radiation, and local and downwind meteorological patterns. Using average ?O3/?CO ratios for major biomes, we estimate global wildfires produce approximately 170 Tg of O3 per year, which is 3.5% of all global tropospheric O3 production. Areas of uncertainty in wildfire O3 production include the net effect of aerosols on chemical and photochemical reactions within a fire plume, the impact of oxygenated volatile organic compounds and nitrous acid on O3 production, and the interplay of variables that lead to extreme ?O3/?CO values. Because wildfire frequencies are likely increasing and have been shown to contribute to elevated O3 at air quality monitoring sites, it is important to better understand the emissions, photochemistry and impacts of these fires.",3.4.1.2,Contributions from Other Natural Sources ,1.3.1.3.3,Landscape Fires

However; the content and efficacy of SIPs have rarely been examined systematically. Here, 20 SIPs developed in response to the 1997 8-hr ozone standard are reviewed as case studies of attainment efforts at the state level. Comparison of observed and model predicted ozone concentrations shows the US. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) recommended modeled attainment test to be a somewhat conservative predictor of attainment. Among 12 SIPs for regions that sought attainment by 2009, the test correctly predicted attainment and non attainment in four and five regions, respectively; in the other three regions, attainment was observed despite predictions of nonattainment However; weight-of-evidence determinations and deviations from the recommended modeled attainment test methodology led five of these SIPs to predict attainment that was not in fact observed by 2009; three of those regions achieved attainment in 2010. Ozone and NO2 concentrations declined across much of the United States during the period covered by the SIPs, with rates of improvement strongly correlated with the initial pollution levels and hence greatest in nonattainment regions. However; at monitors with mid-range levels of ozone initially, rates of reduction were largely independent of the initial attainment status of the region. This is consistent with the fact that apart from California, the majority of ozone precursor reductions documented by SIPs resulted from federal measures rather than from state or local controls specific to the nonattainment regions. Implications: At a time of sharp debate in the United States about strengthening ambient ozone standards, this study highlights strengths and weaknesses of recent state implementation plans. Substantial improvements in air quality have been observed, bringing the majority of regions into attainment of the 1997 ozone standards. The extent to which state-level measures contributed to those improvements is unclear.

Using version 3.1 of the Master Chemical Mechanism (MCM v3.1) as a base mechanism, the sensitivity of the system to a number of detailed mechanistic changes is examined for a wide range of NOx levels, using a simple box model. The studies consider sensitivity tests in relation to three general areas for which experimental and/or theoretical evidence has been reported in the peer-reviewed literature, as follows: (1) implementation of propagating channels for the reactions of HO2 with acyl and ?-oxo peroxy radicals with HO2, with support from a number of studies; (2) implementation of the OH-catalysed conversion of isoprene-derived hydroperoxides to isomeric epoxydiols, as characterised by Paulot et al.~(2009a); and (3) implementation of a mechanism involving respective 1,5 and 1,6 H atom shift isomerisation reactions of the ?-hydroxyalkenyl and cis-?-hydroxyalkenyl peroxy radical isomers, formed from the sequential addition of OH and O2 to isoprene, based on the theoretical study of Peeters et al. (2009). All the considered mechanistic changes lead to simulated increases in the concentrations of OH, with (1) and (2) resulting in respective increases of up to about 7% and 16%, depending on the level of NOx. (3) is found to have potentially much greater impacts, with enhancements in OH concentrations of up to a factor of about 3.3, depending on the level of NOx, provided the (crucial) rapid photolysis of the hydroperoxy-methyl-butenal products of the cis-?-hydroxyalkenyl peroxy radical isomerisation reactions is represented, as also postulated by Peeters et al.~(2009). Additional tests suggest that the mechanism with the reported parameters cannot be fully reconciled with atmospheric observations and existing laboratory data without some degree of parameter refinement and optimisation which would probably include a reduction in the peroxy radical isomerisation rates and a consequent reduction in the OH enhancement propensity. However, an order of magntitude reduction in the isomerisation rates is still found to yield notable enhancements in OH concentrations of up to a factor of about 2, with the maximum impact at the low end of the considered NOx range.

A parameterized representation of the mechanistic changes is optimized and implemented into a reduced variant of the Common Representative Intermediates mechanism (CRI v2-R5), for use in the STOCHEM global chemistry-transport model. The impacts of the modified chemistry in the global model are shown to be consistent with those observed in the box model sensitivity studies, and the results are illustrated and discussed with a particular focus on the tropical forested regions of the Amazon and Borneo where unexpectedly elevated concentrations of OH have recently been reported.",3.2.2,Gas Phase Reactions Leading to O3 Formation,0,0

New evidence indicates that isoprene emissions changed considerably from the mid-1980s to the mid-1990s owing to land-use changes in the eastern United States (Purves et al., 2004). Over this period, U.S. anthropogenic VOC (AVOC) emissions decreased substantially. Here we apply two chemical transport models (GEOS-CHEM and MOZART-2) to test the hypothesis, put forth by Purves et al. (2004), that the absence of decreasing O3 trends over much of the eastern United States may reflect a balance between increases in isoprene emissions and decreases in AVOC emissions. We find little evidence for this hypothesis; over most of the domain, mean July afternoon (1300?1700 local time) surface O3 is more responsive (ranging from ?9 to +7 ppbv) to the reported changes in anthropogenic NOx emissions than to the concurrent isoprene (?2 to +2 ppbv) or AVOC (?2 to 0 ppbv) emission changes. The estimated magnitude of the O3 response to anthropogenic NOx emission changes, however, depends on the base isoprene emission inventory used in the model. The combined effect of the reported changes in eastern U.S. anthropogenic plus biogenic emissions is insufficient to explain observed changes in mean July afternoon surface O3 concentrations, suggesting a possible role for decadal changes in meteorology, hemispheric background O3, or subgrid-scale chemistry. We demonstrate that two major uncertainties, the base isoprene emission inventory and the fate of isoprene nitrates (which influence surface O3 in the model by ?15 to +4 and +4 to +12 ppbv, respectively), preclude a well-constrained quantification of the present-day contribution of biogenic or anthropogenic emissions to surface O3 concentrations, particularly in the high-isoprene-emitting southeastern United States.

The three national parks are Smoky Mountains National Park (GRSM), Mammoth Cave National Park (MACA), and Shenandoah National Park (SHEN), Big Meadows. A base emission scenario and eight variant predictions are analyzed, and predictions are compared with data observed at the three locations for the same time period. Model-predicted concentrations are higher than observed values for O-3 (with a cutoff of 40 ppbv) by 3.0% at GRSM, 19.1% at MACA, and 9.0% at SHEN (mean normalized bias error). They are very similar to observations for overall mean ozone concentrations at GRSM and SHEN. They generally agree (the same order of magnitude) with observed values for lumped paraffin compounds but are an order of magnitude lower for other species (isoprene, ethene, surrogate olefin, surrogate toluene, and surrogate xylene). Model sensitivity analyses here indicate that each location differs in terms of volatile organic compound (VOC) capacity to produce O-3, but a maximum VOC capacity point (MVCP) exists at all locations that changes the influence of VOCs on O-3 from net production to production suppression. Analysis of individual model processes shows that more than 50% of daytime O-3 concentrations at the high-elevation rural locations (GRSM and SHEN) are transported from other areas; local chemistry is the second largest O-3 contributor. At the low-elevation location (MACA), about 80% of daytime O-3 is produced by local chemistry and 20% is transported from other areas. Local emissions (67-95%) are predominantly responsible for VOCs at all locations, the rest coming from transport. Chemistry processes are responsible for about 50% removal of VOCs for all locations; less than 10% are lost to surface deposition and the rest are exported to other areas. Metrics, such as VOC potential for O-3 production (VPOP), which links the chemistry processes of both O-3 and VOCs and MVCP, are devised to measure the different characteristics of O-3 production and VOCs. The values of the defined metrics are mapped for the entire modeling domain. Implications of this model exercise in understanding O-3 production are analyzed and discussed.

A total of twelve sensitivity scenarios which can be grouped into four thematic categories were performed. These four categories consist of simulations with different chemical mechanisms, different assumptions concerning the deposition characteristics of intermediate products, assumptions concerning the nitrates from the oxidation of isoprene and variations of the source strengths. The largest differences in ozone compared to the reference simulation occured when a different isoprene oxidation scheme was used (up to 30-60% or about 10 nmol/mol). The largest differences in the abundance of peroxyacetylnitrate (PAN) were found when the isoprene emission strength was reduced by 50% and in tests with increased or decreased efficiency of the deposition of intermediates. The deposition assumptions were also found to have a significant effect on the upper tropospheric HOx production. Different implicit assumptions about the loss of intermediate products were identified as a major reason for the deviations among the tested isoprene oxidation schemes. The total tropospheric burden of O-3 calculated in the sensitivity runs is increased compared to the background methane chemistry by 26 +/- 9 Tg(O-3) from 273 to an average from the sensitivity runs of 299 Tg(O-3). Thus, there is a spread of +/- 35% of the overall effect of isoprene in the model among the tested scenarios.

Immediately after ozone exposure, we observed a 98.9% increase in interleukin-8, a 21.4% decrease in plasminogen activator inhibitor-1, a 51.3% decrease in the high-frequency component of heart rate variability, and a 1.2% increase in QT duration. Changes in interleukin-1B and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 were apparent 24 hours after exposure. In agreement with previous studies, we also observed ozone-induced drops in lung function and an increase in pulmonary inflammation.<br /><br /><strong>CONCLUSIONS: </strong>This controlled-human-exposure study shows that ozone can cause an increase in vascular markers of inflammation and changes in markers of fibrinolysis and markers that affect autonomic control of heart rate and repolarization. We believe that these findings provide biological plausibility for the epidemiology studies that associate ozone exposure with mortality.<br /><br /><strong>CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION: </strong>URL: http://www.clinicaltrials.gov.

Materials and methods: Existing individual E-R data for 23 human controlled ozone exposure studies with a wide range of concentrations, activity levels, and exposure patterns have been obtained. The data were fit to the original model and to a version of the model that contains a threshold below which no response occurs using a statistical program for fitting nonlinear mixed models. Results: Mean predicted FEV(1) responses and the predicted proportions of individuals experiencing FEV(1) responses greater than 10, 15, and 20% were found to be in agreement with observed responses across a wide range of exposure conditions for both models. The threshold model, however, provided a better fit to the data than the original, particularly at the lowest levels of exposure. Conclusion: The models identified in this manuscript predict population FEV(1) response characteristics for 18-35-year-old individuals exposed to ozone over a wide range of conditions and represent a substantial improvement over earlier E-R models. Because of its better fit to the data, particularly at low levels of exposure, the threshold model is likely to provide more accurate estimates of risk in future risk assessments of ozone-induced FEV(1) effects.",6.2.1.1,Controlled Human Exposure,3.1.4.1.1,Controlled Human Exposure Studies

The fortuitous occurrence of large wildfire episodes in Northern California allowed for studies of fire emissions, their composition, and their interactions with rural and urban air. Relative to CO, emissions of HCN were shown to vary non-linearly with fire characteristics while those of CH3CN were nearly unchanged, making the latter a superior quantitative tracer of biomass combustion. Although some fire plumes over California contained little NOx and virtually no O-3 enhancement, others contained ample VOCs and sufficient NOx, largely from urban influences, to result in significant ozone formation. The highest observed O-3 mixing ratios (170 ppb) were also in fire-influenced urban air masses. Attempts to simulate these interactions using CMAQ a high-resolution state of the art air quality model, were only minimally successful and indicated several shortcomings in simulating fire emission influences on urban smog formation. A variety of secondary oxidation products (e.g. O-3, PAN, HCHO) were substantially underestimated in fire-influenced air masses. Available data involving fire plumes and anthropogenic pollution interactions are presently quite sparse and additional observational and mechanistic studies are needed.

When the Australians simulated their experiments with CB4, they found that CB4 underpredicted ozone production at low VOC-to-NO(x) ratios, i.e. in the NO(x)-rich region of the ozone isopleth diagram above the ridge line. CB4 predicts a significant NO(x) inhibition in this region whereas the empirical General Reaction Set (GRS) mechanism, which was developed by the Australian researchers to fit their data, does not. In this study, a mass balance and process analysis technique is used to explain the origins of the NO(x)-inhibition in CB4 simulations. The causes are determined to be in the inorganic reactions of the CB4, which are believed to be both complete and well-known. The primary cause was a strong negative feedback of new radical production from the photolysis of ozone which occurred because of the longer delay needed to oxidize the higher initial NO. The CB4 mechanism could still be incorrect if it is missing a strong radical source, for example, in the poorly understood aromatics chemistry. The GRS, which lacks representation of the inorganic processes responsible for NO(x)-inhibition, may be achieving its predictive accuracy by compensating errors. If this is true, then the GRS would be unsatisfactory for ambient air use. Additional smog chamber experiments at low VOC-to-NO(x) ratios and better characterization of the Australian chambers are needed to resolve the discrepancy in CB4 and GRS predictions.",3.2.4,Temperature and Chemical Precursor Relationships,0,0

Local indicators of instantaneous odd oxygen production sensitivity,"Tonnesen, GS; Dennis, RL",2000,"We used a simple trajectory model and a three-dimensional grid model to evaluate several indicators that can be used to predict the sensitivity of odd oxygen production (P(O-x)) to changes in emissions of anthropogenic nonmethane hydrocarbons (VOC) and nitrogen oxides (NOx = NO + NO2). To perform the evaluation, we augmented the model to include new diagnostic outputs such as rates of P(O-x), rates of conversion of NOx to unreactive nitrogen, and radical chain length. We used the new diagnostic outputs to explain the model-predicted sensitivity of P(O-x) to changes in VOC and NOx emissions. We found that the ozone ridgeline, which distinguishes between NOx-limited and radical-limited conditions, is determined by a ridgeline of maximum OH chain length. We examined the radical propagation reactions which affect OH chain length, and we developed four indicators related to radical propagation efficiency: I(HC,NO2) which approximates the fraction of OH that reacts with hydrocarbons; I(NO,RO2) which approximates the fraction of HO2 that reacts with NO; the ratio of [O-3]/[NOx] which affects the balance between radical initiation and propagation; and [HO2] which is the dominant term in P(H2O2)/P(HNO3).

Three probing tools are available in a three-dimensional air quality model, CAMx: the Decoupled Direct Method (DDM), the Ozone Source Attribution Technology (OSAT), and Process Analysis (PA). These tools are evaluated in terms of consistency, complementarity, accuracy and robustness, and computational requirements using the 7-15 July 1995 O-3 episode over the eastern United States. The NOx-versus VOC-sensitivity of O-3 chemistry and relative role of chemistry and transport predicted by the three tools are qualitatively consistent, except that OSAT predicts an NOx-limited O-3 chemistry at a few locations where both DDM and PA predict a VOC-sensitive O-3 chemistry. DDM and OSAT agree well on the top 10 contributors to O-3 formation, but they predict different rankings, with greater importance given to biogenic VOC emissions by DDM and greater importance given to surface anthropogenic NOx emissions by OSAT. The major difference in the DDM and OSAT predictions on the relative impact of sources is that DDM predicts both positive and negative sensitivities whereas OSAT always predicts positive contributions. Compared to the single-perturbation method ( brute force method), DDM predicts accurate model responses under the 25% VOC or NOx emission reduction scenarios but inaccurate results under the 75% NOx emission reduction scenario. OSAT predicts accurate model responses under the 25% VOC emission reduction scenario, but inaccurate responses under the 25% and 75% NOx emission reduction scenarios. While these tools provide valuable and complementary information regarding O-3 formation, each of them has limitations in terms of its design and application for the design of emission control strategies. DDM is suitable for such an application for small-to-moderate emission reductions of &lt;40%. OSAT leads to incorrect results for VOC-limited areas because it does not account for the titration/inhibition effect of NOx and/or VOC. PA provides an in-depth understanding of the processes involved in controlling O-3 formation locally.

The stability and bioactivities of these species are pH-dependent; however, the pH of the airway during acute asthma has not previously been studied. As with gastric and urinary acidification, asthmatic airway acidification could be expected dramatically to alter the concentrations and bioactivities/cytotoxicities of endogenous nitrogen oxides. Here, we demonstrate that the pH of deaerated exhaled airway vapor condensate is over two log orders lower in patients with acute asthma (5.23 +/- 0.21, n = 22) than in control subjects (7.65 +/- 0.20, n = 19, p < 0.001) and normalizes with corticosteroid therapy. Values are highly reproducible, unaffected by salivary or therapeutic artifact, and identical to samples taken directly from the lower airway. Further, at these low pH values, the endogenous airway compound, nitrite, is converted to nitric oxide (NO) in quantities sufficient largely to account for the concentrations of NO in asthmatic expired air, and eosinophils undergo accelerated necrosis. We speculate that airway pH may be an important determinant of expired NO concentration and airway inflammation, and suggest that regulation of airway pH has a previously unsuspected role in asthma pathophysiology.",6.2.3.2,Epidemiology,0,0

CO showed the most consistently significant (p < 0.05) relationships to cardiovascular admissions. A wintertime 25th-75th percentile increase in CO (1.1-2.2 ppm) predicted an increase of 4% in cardiovascular admissions. NO2, and, to a lesser extent, PM10 tracked CO and showed similar associations with cardiovascular disease, but O3 was negatively or nonsignificantly associated. No significant demographic differences were found, although increased cardiovascular effects were suggested in diabetics, in whites and blacks (relative to Hispanics and Asians), and in persons older than 65 years of age. Pulmonary disease admissions associated more with NO2 and PM10 than with CO. Pulmonary effects were generally smaller than cardiovascular effects and were more sensitive to the choice of model.

This paper presents the design of and some results from a new prospective mortality study of a national cohort of about 50,000 U.S. veterans who were diagnosed as hypertensive in the mid-1970s, based on approximately 21 years of follow-up. This national cohort is male with an average age at recruitment of 51 +/- 12 y; 35% were black and 81% had been smokers at one time. Because the subjects have been receiving care at various U.S. Veterans Administration (VA) hospitals, access to and quality of medical care are relatively homogeneous. The health endpoints available for analysis include all-cause mortality and specific diagnoses for morbidity during VA hospitalizations; only the mortality results are discussed here. Non-pollution predictor variables in the baseline model include race, smoking (ever or at recruitment), age, systolic and diastolic blood pressure (BP), and body mass index (BMI). Interactions of BP and BMI with age were also considered. Although this study essentially controls for socioeconomic status by design because of the homogeneity of the cohort, selected ecological variables were also considered at the zip code and county levels, some of which were found to be significant predictors. Pollutants were averaged by year and county for TSP, PM10, CO, O3, and NO2; SO2 and Pb were considered less thoroughly. Both mean and peak levels were considered for gases. SO42- data from the AIRS database and PM2.5, coarse particles, PM15, and SO42- from EPA's Inhalable Particulate (IP) Network were also considered. Four relevant exposure periods were defined: 1974 and earlier (back to 1953 for TSP), 1975-81, 1982-88, and 1989-96. Deaths during each of the three most recent exposure periods were considered separately, yielding up to 12 combinations of exposure and mortality periods for each pollutant. Associations between concurrent air quality and mortality periods were considered to relate to acute responses; delayed associations with prior exposures were considered to be emblematic of initiation of chronic disease. Pre-exposure mortality associations were considered to be indirect (non-causal). The implied mortality risks of long-term exposure to air pollution were found to be sensitive to the details of the regression model, the time period of exposure, the locations included and to the inclusion of ecological as well as personal variables. Both positive and negative statistically significant mortality responses were found. Fine particles as measured in the 1979-84 EPA Inhalable Particulate Network indicated no significant (positive) excess mortality risk for this cohort in any of the models considered. Among the positive responses, indications of concurrent mortality risks were seen for NO2 and peak O3 with a similar indication of delayed risks only for NO2. The mean levels of these excess risks were in the range of 5-9%. Peak O3 was dominant in 2-pollutant models and there was some indication of a threshold in response. However, it is likely that standard errors of the regression coefficients may have been underestimated because of spatial autocorrelation among the model residuals. The significant variability of responses by period of death cohort suggests that aggregation over the entire period of follow-up obscures important aspects of the implied pollution-mortality relationships, such as early depletion of the available pool of those subjects who may be most susceptible to air pollution effects.",7.7,Mortality,0,0

Daily concentrations of nitrogen dioxide (NO2), sulphur dioxide (SO2), ozone (O3), and particulate matter <10 ""mu""m in aerodynamic diameter (PM10) were obtained from seven air monitoring stations in Hong Kong in 1994 and 1995. Relative risks (RR) of respiratory and cardiovascular disease admissions (for an increase of 10 ""mu""g/m3 in concentration of air pollutant) were calculated. Results- Significant associations were found between hospital admissions for all respiratory diseases, all cardiovascular diseases, chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases, and heart failure and the concentrations of all four pollutants. Admissions for asthma, pneumonia, and influenza were significantly associated with NO2, O3, and PM10. Relative risk (RR) for admissions for respiratory disease for the four pollutants ranged from 1.013 (for SO2) to 1.022 (for O3), and for admissions for cardiovascular disease, from 1.006 (for PM10) to 1.016 (for SO2). Those aged >=65 years were at higher risk. Significant positive interactions were detected between NO2, O3, and PM10, and between O3 and winter months. Conclusions-Adverse health effects are evident at current ambient concentrations of air pollutants. Further reduction in air pollution is necessary to protect the health of the community, especially that of the high risk group.",6.3.2.7,Hospital Admissions and Emergency Department Visits,0,0

The mortality analysis of 90 sampled cities, using the same methods and a unified approach to look at questions previously unexamined, is a major contribution beyond other attempts to combine data from many cities and understand the PM10 -mortality association. The results of both the 20-city and 90-city analyses are generally consistent with an average approximate 0.5% increase in overall mortality per 10 Ag/m 3 increase in PM10. Copollutants in the 20-city and 90-city analyses did not appear to affect the PM10 -mortality association. The difference, or heterogeneity, in PM10 effect by region in these results needs further elucidation. The morbidity analysis also used a unified analytic method to provide a previously unavailable basis for examining the consistency of association of PM10 and hospital admissions and determinants of its variation. The results were consistent with an approximately 1% increase in cardiovascular admissions and about 2% increase for pneumonia and COPD per 10 Ag/m3 PM10. The analysis demonstrated convincingly, using the distributed-lag approach, that numbers of hospital admissions were associated with pollution levels over several previous days. The distributed-lag approach will be an important tool in future analyses because it eliminates the need to choose a specific lag for analysis. The observation that the PM10 effect on hospital admissions persisted at ambient concentrations below 50 Ag/m3 is important, but the greater effect per unit exposure at these lower concentrations should be considered suggestive rather than definitive. Given the uncertainties involved in calculating precise effect estimates with the models, the meaning of these preliminary findings should await completion of concentration-response analyses now under way. The PM10 effect did not appear to be confounded by copollutants, but it is unclear whether the approach to assessing and controlling for confounding in the morbidity analysis had adequate statistical power for this purpose. No large modifying effects of sociodemographic factors were identified. Moderate effects cannot be ruled out because the power to detect effect modification was limited by the number of cities studied and because the available census data might not have adequately reflected the unknown vulnerabilities of the elderly in each city. In conclusion, NMMAPS Part II presents results of a major study using new approaches to time-series analysis of PM10 health effects and has added substantially to our understanding of PM10 effects on mortality and morbidity. These findings also provide valuable suggestions for additional research that will further enhance our understanding of air pollution effects on health.",6.2.7.2,Hospital Admission Studies,0,0

We show in Vicia faba that O(3) inhibits (i) guard cell K(+) channels that mediate K(+) uptake that drives stomatal opening; (ii) stomatal opening in isolated epidermes; and (iii) stomatal opening in leaves, such that CO2 assimilation is reduced without direct effects of O3 on photosynthetic capacity.

Maternal exposures to sulfur dioxide (SO2), total suspended particles (TSP), and nitrous oxides (NOx) in each trimester of pregnancy were estimated as the arithmetic means of all daily measurements taken by all monitors in the district of birth of each infant. Oddsratios of low birth weight (< 2500 g), prematurity (< 37 weeks of gestation), and intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR; < 10th percentile of birth weight for gestational age and sex) were estimated by robust logistic regression. The median (and 25th and 75th percentile) trimester exposures were 32(18, 56) mug/m3 for SO2; 72 (55, 87) mug/m3 for TSP; and 38 (23, 59) mug/m3 for NOx. Low birth weight (prevalence 5.2%) and prematurity (prevalence 4.8%) were associated with SO2 and somewhat less strongly with TSP. IUGR was not associated with any pollutant. The effects on low birth weight and prematurity were marginally stronger for exposures in the first trimester, and were not attenuated at all by adjustment for socioeconomic factors or the month of birth. Adjusted odds ratios of low birth weight were 1.20 [95% confidence interval (CI), 1.11-1.30] and 1.15 (CI, 1.07-1.24) for a 50 mug/m3 increase in SO2 and TSP, respectively, in thefirst trimester; adjusted odds ratios of prematurity were 1.27 (CI, 1.16-1.39) and 1.18 (CI, 1.05-1.31) for a 50 mug/m3 increase in SO2 and TSP, respectively, in the first trimester.

An active surveillance system ascertained the numbers and types of absences during the first 6 months of 1996. Pollutants were measured hourly at central-site monitors in each of the 12 communities. To examine acute effects of air pollution on absence rates, we fitted a two-stage time-series model to the absence count data that included distributed lag effects of exposure adjusted for long-term pollutant levels. Short-term change in O3, but not NO2 or PM10, was associated with a substantial increase in school absences from both upper and lower respiratory illness. An increase of 20 ppb of O3 was associated with an increase of 62.9% [95% confidence interval (95% CI) = 18.4-124.1%] for illness-related absence rates, 82.9% (95% CI = 3.9-222.0%) for respiratory illnesses, 45.1% (95% CI = 21.3-73.7%) for upper respiratory illnesses, and 173.9% (95% CI = 91.3-292.3%) for lower respiratory illnesses with wet cough.

It included 2,445 children from the 8th and 9th school grades who had been living for at least 3 years in an area where some communities undergo the heaviest photochemical exposure in France. Data on rhinitis, asthmatic symptoms, and asthma prevalence were gathered with the ISAAC paper and video questionnaires.

METHODS: To clarify this issue, we performed a cross-sectional epidemiological survey in 2604 primary school children, 10 and 11 years old, living in seven communities among which some have the highest photochemical exposure in France. The mean levels of the main gaseous air pollutants (SO2, NO2 and O3) were measured during a 2-month period in 1993. The protocol included a standardized questionnaire, skin prick tests to common aeroallergens and in the atopic children, collection of a sample of mattress dust to measure group 1 mite allergens. Atopy was only defined on the basis of the skin prick tests. RESULTS: Percentage of positive skin tests and the number of positive skin tests were similar in the different communities looked at. The distribution of dust samples with a group 1 allergen level greater than 2 microg/g dust, was also similar. Logistic regression analysis including potential confounding factors, as well as the mean level of air pollutants, did not demonstrate any association between atopy and mean SO2, NO2 and O3 levels.

We hypothesize that macrophage-derived inflammatory cytokines and cytotoxic mediators contribute to the pathogenic process. Treatment of rats with ozone (2 ppm, 3 h) results in damage to the alveolar epithelium and increased protein in lung lavage fluid. This is associated with an increase in the number of macrophages in the lung. We found that these cells are activated to release the proinflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor-""alpha"" (TNF""alpha"") which has been implicated in tissue injury. Following ozone inhalation, alveolar macrophages also produce increased amounts of the cytotoxic mediator, nitric oxide. This response is time-dependent and correlated with expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase (NOS II) protein and mRNA. Inhibition of macrophages with gadolinium chloride abrogates ozone-induced inflammation, mediator production and tissue injury. These data demonstrate, that macrophages and mediators they release contribute to irritant-induced lung injury. Ozone inhalation also caused alterations in the liver, including increased nitric oxide production and protein synthesis suggesting that ozone induces an acute phase response. We speculate that this is mediated by cytokines such as TNF""alpha"" produced by alveolar macrophages. In this regard we noted increased expression of TNF""alpha""  in both lung and liver tissue.

In both these tissues, a localized accumulation of macrophages is observed following toxicant exposure.

These findings provide direct support for our hypothesis that macrophages contribute to tissue injury.

Ozone was consistently associated with admissions for asthma and respiratory disease-with little evidence of a threshold. In two-pollutant models, the ozone effect was relatively unaffected by the control for high levels of other pollutants. Particulate pollution (measured by nephelometry) was associated positively with admissions for respiratory disease and admissions for asthma in summer, whereas a negative association was observed for cardiovascular admissions. Although sulfur dioxide was associated significantly with admissions for respiratory and cardiovascular disese, a significant association was also found for the control diagnosis of digestive disorders. No significant associations were found for nitrogen dioxide over the study period, although significantly positive seasonal interactions were found for asthma and respiratory disease in autumn, winter, and spring.

Whether high concentrations of ambient particles can trigger the onset of acute myocardial infarction (MI), however, remains unknown. Methods and Results-We interviewed 772 patients with MI in the greater Boston area between January 1995 and May 1996 as part of the Determinants of Myocardial Infarction Onset Study. Hourly concentrations of particle mass <2.5 ""mu""m (PM2.5), carbon black, and gaseous air pollutants were measured. A case-crossover approach was used to analyze the data for evidence of triggering. The risk of MI onset increased in association with elevated concentrations of fine particles in the previous 2-hour period. In addition, a delayed response associated with 24-hour average exposure 1 day before the onset of symptoms was observed. Multivariate analyses considering both time windows jointly revealed an estimated odds ratio of I .48 associated with an increase of 25 ""mu""g/m3 PM2.5 during a 2-hour period before the onset and an odds ratio of 1.69 for an increase of 20 ""mu""g/m3 PM2.5 in the 24-hour period 1 day before the onset (95% CIs 1.09, 2.02 and 1.13, 2.34, respectively).

We considered confounding from other pollutants as well as meteorologic and chronologic variables. We investigated several variables describing the cities' pollution, climate, population, and geography as potential effect modifiers. For the individual city analysis, generalized additive models extending Poisson regression, using a smoother to control for seasonal patterns, were applied. To provide quantitative summaries of the results and explain remaining heterogeneity, we applied second-stage regression models.

U-EPX was determined from a single spot urine sample during autumn 1997. Children were participants in a longitudinal study of ozone effects on lung function. RESULTS: The 5-95% percentiles of ozone exposure (30-day mean before test) were 11.8-51.5 p.p.b. (mean: 31.6 ppb).

* Ground-level ozone (O3) curtails agricultural production in many regions world-wide. However, the etiology of O3 toxicity remains unclear. Activated oxygen species appear to inflict biochemical lesions and propagate defense responses that compound plant injury. Because some plant defense responses involve membrane-delimited GTPases (G proteins), we evaluated the O3 sensitivity of Arabidopsis mutants altered in the heterotrimeric G-protein pathway.
* Eight genotypes were treated with a range of O3 concentrations (0, 100, 175 and 250 nmol mol-1) for 13 d in controlled environment chambers.
* After treatment with O3, the epinasty typically observed for wild type leaves did not occur in mutant plants lacking the alpha subunit of the C-protein complex (gpal). O3-induced suppression of leaf chlorophyll levels and leaf mass per unit leaf area were less for gpal mutants and were not due to differences in O3 flux.
* There was a positive correlation between the lack of a G-protein alpha subunit and decreased O3 sensitivity. Our results suggest that a heterotrimeric G-protein is critically involved in the expression of O3 effects in plants.",9.3.3.1,Ozone Signal Transduction,0,0

Methods  3535 children with no history of asthma were recruited from schools in 12 communities in southern California and were followed up for up to 5 years. 265 children reported a new diagnosis of asthma during follow-up. We assessed risk of asthma in children playing team sports at study entry in six communities with high daytime ozone concentrations, six with lower concentrations, and in communities with high or low concentrations of nitrogen dioxide, particulate matter, and inorganic-acid vapour. 
Findings  In communities with high ozone concentrations, the relative risk of developing asthma in children playing three or more sports was 3A3 (95% CI 1A9-5A8), compared with children playing no sports. Sports had no effect in areas of low ozone concentration (0A8, 0A4-1A6). Time spent outside was associated with a higher incidence of asthma in areas of high ozone (1A4, 1A0-2A1), but not in areas of low ozone.

Objective To assess the relationship between long-term exposure to fine particulate air pollution and all-cause, lung cancer, and cardiopulmonary mortality.

Design, Setting, and Participants Vital status and cause of death data were collected by the American Cancer Society as part of the Cancer Prevention II study, an ongoing prospective mortality study, which enrolled approximately 1.2 million adults in 1982. Participants completed a questionnaire detailing individual risk factor data (age, sex, race, weight, height, smoking history, education, marital status, diet, alcohol consumption, and occupational exposures). The risk factor data for approximately 500 000 adults were linked with air pollution data for metropolitan areas throughout the United States and combined with vital status and cause of death data through December 31, 1998.

Main Outcome Measure All-cause, lung cancer, and cardiopulmonary mortality.

Results Fine particulate and sulfur oxide?related pollution were associated with all-cause, lung cancer, and cardiopulmonary mortality. Each 10-?g/m3 elevation in fine particulate air pollution was associated with approximately a 4%, 6%, and 8% increased risk of all-cause, cardiopulmonary, and lung cancer mortality, respectively.

After controlling for cofactors including infant sex, maternal residential city, education, medical risk factors, active tobacco use, drug use, alcohol use, prenatal care, mother's age, race and ethnicity of mothers, and weight gain of mothers, we found PM10 exposure in the third trimester of pregnancy to be a significant predictor of birth weight of newborns. A 10-Ag/m3 increase in the 24-h PM10 level in the third trimester of pregnancy can be associated with a birth-weight reduction of 11 g (95% CI: 2.3-19.8 g) using multiple linear regression; however, PM10 was not found to be related with the risk of LBW from logistic regression.

To help explain the mechanism behind these observations, we investigated the effect of air pollution exposure on vascular function. Methods and Results - Twenty-five healthy adults underwent a randomized, double-blind, crossover study comparing the vascular response to the 2-hour inhalation of ~150 Ag/m3 of concentrated ambient fine particles (CAP) plus ozone (120 ppb) versus the response to the inhalation of filtered air. High-resolution vascular ultrasonography was used to measure alterations in brachial artery diameter, endothelial-dependent flow-mediated dilatation (FMD) and endothelial- independent nitroglycerin-mediated dilatation (NMD). Exposure to CAP plus ozone caused a significant brachial artery vasoconstriction compared with filtered air inhalation (-0.09?0.15 mm versus +0.01?0.18 mm, P=0.03). There were no significant differences in FMD (+0.29?4.11% versus -0.03?6.63%~ P=0.88), NMD (+3.87?5.43% versus +3.46?7.92%, P=0.83), or blood pressure responses between exposures.

In field studies, O3 treatments were charcoal filtered air (CF), nonfiltered afr (NF), and two NF treatments with O3 added for 12 h d-1 at proportions of 1.25 and 1.50 times the ambient O3 concentration. In greenhouse studies, constant amounts of O3 were added to CF for 6 h d-1 to achieve mean concentrations ranging from S to 100 nL L-1.

Rats exposed to 0.1 or 0.3 ppm O3 for 4 h/day, 5 days/wk, for 1 or 3 wk were analyzed for the ability to clear an intrapulmonary challenge with Listeria monocytogenes or had their lungs processed to obtain pulmonary alveolar macrophages (PAM) and lung-associated lymphocytes for analyses of select cell functions and surface marker expression. The results indicate that repeated inhalation exposure to O3 affected local cell-mediated immunity (CMI) responses as evidenced by effects on clearance of Listeria. However, this modulation was not consistently dependent on exposure concentration or duration. Short-term repeat exposures had more effect on host resistance than did the more prolonged regimen, with rats exposed to 0.1 ppm O3 most adversely impacted. Clearance patterns suggest modifications in innate resistance following 1 wk of exposure to 0.1 ppm O3, but no similar effect following a 3-wk regimen. Exposure to 0.3 ppm O3 appeared to affect both innate and acquired resistance after a 1-wk regimen, but mainly the former after an additional wk of exposure. We conclude that these two mechanisms of resistance are differentially affected by O3 and that distinct time- and O3 concentration-dependent adaptation phenomena evolve for each; that is, in situ adaptation to higher levels of O3 may occur more readily with acquired than with innate/PAM-dependent resistance. A similar pattern of inconsistent effect on PAM and lung-associated lymphocytes was also evident. For example, while 3-wk exposures had a greater effect on PAM reactive oxygen intermediate ROI production, evidence for a significant effect on antibacterial activity was only notable among PAM from rats exposed for 1 wk. Among lung lymphocytes, while 3-wk exposure to 0.1 ppm O3 led to a significant increase in CD25 expression, there was no corresponding increase in responsivity to concanavalin A (ConA); only among cells from 1-wk-exposed rats did lymphoproliferative responses increase. Though investigations of altered immune cell cytokine receptor expression/binding activity are ongoing results herein provide further evidence to support our longstanding hypothesis that some well-documented effects of O3 exposure on human health are quite likely linked to changes in local immune cell (i.e., PAM and lung-associated lymphocytes) functions, with the latter being related to changes in the capacities of these cells to interact with immunoregulatory cytokines.",6.2.5.3,Alveolar Macrophages ,0,0

Issues the design of that study could not address were (1) the status of cellular differentiation at earlier time points during the course of ozone exposure; (2) whether changes that appeared to be compensatory after 20 months of exposure were due to ozone, or were aspects of the natural aging process in rats; (3) the inability to define adequately which effects were related specifically to the prolonged duration of exposure; and (4) how and what changes brought about by the natural aging process may have overridden or confounded a clear definition of the effects of exposure to ozone at ambient concentrations (e.g., 0.12 parts per million [ppm]), which are of most concern with long-term exposure to this pollutant. The present study examined the effects of a 3-month exposure to ozone under conditions identical to those of the 20-month NTP/HEI Collaborative Ozone Project. In our facilities at the University of California, Davis, we exposed 42 male F344/N rats to either filtered air or 0.12 or 1.0 ppm ozone. After 3 months of exposure to 1.0 ppm ozone, changes in the distribution of superoxide dismutase (SOD) in the copper-zinc (Cu-Zn) form were shown by a pattern of reduced staining in terminal bronchioles and the centriacinar region; and the manganese (Mn) form of SOD was elevated within the centriacinar region. Further analysis by transmission electron microscopy and immunogold labeling confirmed that Mn SOD was elevated within epithelial type II cells immediately distal to the bronchiole-alveolar duct, junction (BADJ). The trachea, three major bronchi, and a short-length and long-length airway path relative to the trachea were examined by morphometric techniques. The pulmonary acini arising from each of these two paths were also examined morphometrically as a function of distance into the alveolar duct. Cellular changes occurring in each of these anatomical regions after 3 months of exposure were analyzed and compared to the changes noted after the 20-month ozone exposures. We found significant increases in the volume density of nonciliated epithelial cells lining the trachea and caudal bronchi as well as in the proximal and terminal bronchioles of the cranial region at a concentration of 1.0 ppm ozone after both 3 and 20 months of exposure. Remodeling of the centriacinar region, particularly within the cranial region of the lungs after exposure to 1.0 ppm ozone, was statistically significant at both 3 and 20 months. No statistically significant effects were noted following exposure to 0.12 ppm ozone for either 3 or 20 months. An important finding was that age did not influence the effect of ozone on the lungs of rats. We conclude that long-term exposure to ozone, rather than the effects of aging, lead to significant alterations of epithelial cell populations lining the airways and centriacinar region of the lung.

In this study, we combined leaf-level ozone response data from independent ozone fumigation studies with a forest ecosystem model in order simulate the effects of ambient ozone on mature hardwood forests. Reductions in leaf carbon gain were determined as a linear function of ozone flux to the leaf interior, calculated as the product of ozone concentration and leaf stomatal conductance. This relationship was applied to individual canopy layers within the model in order to allow interaction with stand- and canopy-level factors such as light attenuation, leaf morphology, soil water limitations, and vertical ozone gradients. The resulting model was applied to 64 locations across the northeastern United States using ambient ozone data from 1987 to 1992. Predicted declines in annual net primary production ranged from 3 to 16% with greatest reductions in southern portions of the region where ozone levels were highest, and on soils with high water-holding capacity where drought stress was absent. Reductions in predicted wood growth were slightly greater (3-22%) because wood is a lower carbon allocation priority in the model than leaf and root growth. Interannual variation in predicted ozone effects was small due to concurrent fluctuations in ozone and climate. Periods of high ozone often coincided with hot, dry weather conditions, causing reduced stomatal conductance and ozone uptake. Within-canopy ozone concentration gradients had little effect on predicted growth reductions because concentrations remained high through upper canopy layers where net carbon assimilation and ozone uptake were greatest. Sensitivity analyses indicate a trade-off between model sensitivity to available soil water and foliar nitrogen and demonstrate uncertainties regarding several assumptions used in the model. Uncertainties surrounding ozone effects on stomatal function and plant water use efficiency were found to have important implications on current predictions.

Biomass was evaluated following 3, 5, 7 and 13 wk exposure. Biomass following 13 wk exposure also included weekly harvests of mature tomato fruit beginning week 8. Carbon dioxide enrichment significantly enhanced total vegetative plant d. wt at each harvest, as well as cumulative yield of mature fruit, whereas O3 significantly suppressed total vegetative plant d. wt at each harvest and reduced total cumulative fruit yield. The magnitude of these changes varied with the development of tomato from early growth to mature fruit yield. Carbon dioxide enrichment reduced the detrimental effects of O3 on total vegetative plant d. wt of tomato following 3, 5, 7 and 13 wk exposure. Final mature fruit yield was 24% higher under enriched CO, treatments than in ambient CO2. Ozone suppressed final yield by 31 % following exposure to 80 nmol mol-1 O3 when compared with exposure to charcoal-filtered (CF) air. The impacts of both CO2 and O3 on yield were, however, dependent upon the presence or absence of the other gas. In the absence of O3, yields were very similar for the ambient and elevated CO2 treatments, but in the presence of O3, yields under ambient CO2 were greatly suppressed whereas yields under elevated CO2 were similar to those in the absence of O3.

This is associated with an accumulation of activated macrophages in the lower lung, which we have demonstrated contribute to tissue injury. Nitric oxide (NO) is a highly reactive cytotoxic macrophage-derived mediator that has been implicated in lung damage. In the present studies we used knockout mice with a targeted disruption of the gene for inducible nitric oxide synthase (NOSII) to analyze the role of NO in ozone-induced lung inflammation and tissue injury. Treatment of wild-type control mice with ozone (0.8 ppm) for 3 h resulted in a time-dependent increase in protein and cells in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, which reached a maximum 24-48 h after exposure. Alveolar macrophages isolated from animals treated with ozone were found to produce increased amounts of NO, as well as peroxynitrite. This was correlated with induction of NOSII protein and nitrotyrosine staining of lung macrophages in tissue sections and in culture. Production of superoxide anion and prostaglandin (PG)E2 by alveolar macrophages was also increased after ozone inhalation. In contrast, alveolar macrophages from NOSII knockout mice did not produce reactive nitrogen intermediates even after ozone inhalation. Moreover, production of PGE2 was at control levels. NOSII knockout mice were also protected from ozone-induced inflammation and tissue injury, as measured by bronchoalveolar lavage protein and cell number. There was also no evidence of peroxynitrite-mediated lung damage in these animals. Taken together, these data demonstrate that NO, produced via NOSII, and potentially, its reactive oxidative product peroxynitrite, play a critical role in ozone-induced release of inflammatory mediators and in tissue injury.",8.1,Genetic Factors,0,0

Although evidence indicates that each of these respiratory insults individually can increase asthma severity in susceptible individuals, we know little about the extent to which exposure to environmental oxidant pollutants can influence the course of respiratory viral infection and its associated inflammation. To investigate the interaction of these two stimuli within their common epithelial cell targets in the upper and lower respiratory tracks, we infected primary human nasal epithelial cells and cells of the BEAS-2B line grown at the air-liquid interface with human rhinovirus type 16 (RV16) and exposed them to NO2 (2.0 ppm) or O3 (0.2 ppm) for 3 hr. Independently, RV16, NO2, and O3 rapidly increased release of the inflammatory cytokine interleukin-8 through oxidant-dependent mechanisms. The combined effect of RV16 and oxidant ranged from 42% to 250% greater than additive for NO2 and from 41% to 67% for O3. We abrogated these effects by treating the cells with the antioxidant N-acetylcysteine. Surface expression of intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1) underwent additive enhancement in response to combined stimulation. These data indicate that oxidant pollutants can amplify the generation of proinflammatory cytokines by RV16-infected cells and suggest that virus-induced inflammation in upper and lower airways may be exacerbated by concurrent exposure to ambient levels of oxidants commonly encountered the indoor and outdoor environments.",6.2.3.1,Controlled Human Exposures,0,0

In this study we compared the responses of these same clones exposed to O(3) under field conditions along a natural O(3) gradient and in a Free-Air CO(2) and O(3) Enrichment (FACE) facility. In addition, we examined how elevated CO(2) affected O(3) symptom development.

Clonal differences in O(3) sensitivity were consistent with our OTC rankings. Elevated CO(2) (200 ppm over ambient and applied during daylight hours during the growing season) reduced visible foliar symptoms for all three clones from 31 to 96% as determined by symptom development in elevated O(3) versus elevated O(3) + CO(2) treatments. Degradation of the epicuticular wax surface of all three clones was found at the two elevated O(3) gradient sites.

The fluorescence character, t(1/2), proved to be very sensitive to ozone, and it responded at all stages of plant development, but the ratio of variable to maximum fluorescence decreased only when plants received ozone during the first 2 wk of growth. The reduction was caused by a drop in maximum fluorescence. Ozone had no effect on F0. Whenever exposure occurred, O3 significantly reduced net CO2 assimilation and increased stomatal conductance. Unlike t(1/2), the effects were persistent, affecting leaves that were in bud or enshrouded by leaves when the exposure occurred.

Compared to sun leaves, shade leaves exhibited greater proportional reductions in Asat and had lower chlorophyll concentrations, quantum efficiencies, and leaf absorptances when treated with ozone relative to controls. With increasing ozone dose over time, Asat became uncoupled from stomatal conductance as ratios of internal to external concentrations of carbon dioxide increased, reducing water-use efficiency. Ozone reduced net photosynthesis and impaired stomatal function, with these effects depending on the irradiance environment of the canopy leaves.

The proportion of monocytes and neutrophils recovered by bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) as well as the level of total protein in BAL fluid were significantly increased in both IL-6 KO and WT mice following exposure to ozone or to ADSS/ozone. However, bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) labeling within terminal bronchiolar epithelium and proximal alveolar regions in IL-6 KO mice exposed to ozone or to ADSS/ozone was significantly reduced compared with IL-6 sufficient mice (WT). WT mice treated with IL-6 antibodies also demonstrated a reduction in BrdU cell labeling similar to that observed in IL-6 KO mice following exposure to ozone or ADSS/ozone. Clara cell secretory protein (CCSP) abundance, a marker of Clara cell maturation and function, was markedly reduced in the terminal bronchiolar epithelium of WT mice following exposure to ADSS and/or ozone, whereas CCSP abundance was unchanged in IL-6 KO mice.

Aspects of sexual reproduction were measured to determine whether impairment occurs in polluted air. Additionally, the ozone protectant chemical ethylenediurea (EDU) was applied to foliage to determine its effect on foliar injury. By the end of the experiment visible foliar injury was absent in CF air and nominal in the NF and AA treatments. Plants grown in CF-chamber air produced significantly more flowers and fruits than those grown in either NF-chamber air or AA plots. Flowers produced by plants grown in CF air also survived to mature fruits at a rate 1.7I greater than plants in NF air and 1.5I greater than plants in AA plots. We were unable to conclude whether EDU protected plants from foliar ozone injury due to the general lack of foliar injury in ozone-exposed plants.

It is also well established that sensitivity to ozone may differ not only between species, but also between cultivars and populations of individual species, and that the impact of exposure is highly dependent on ozone concentration and the duration and timing of exposure. However, few studies have attempted to distinguish between the direct effects of air pollutants on reproductive development, and indirect effects mediated by injury to the vegetative organs and associated changes in the supply of assimilates and other essential resources to support reproductive growth, or the levels of endogenous growth regulators.

Dieback was especially prominent in two of the five clones, and was attributed to those clones growing longer into the autumnal season where they were subject to frost. Our results show that elevated O3 negates expected positive growth effects of elevated CO2 in Populus tremuloides in the field, and suggest that future climate model predictions should take into account the offsetting effects of elevated O3 on CO2 enrichment when estimating future growth of trembling aspen stands.

Plants were grown in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan in open-top chambers with O3 exposures that ranged from 7 to 92 ppm-h. Depending on the genotype, total seasonal O3 exposure in the range of 50-92 ppm-h had negative impacts on stem, retained leaf, and root biomass accumulation and on diameter growth. Leaf abscission generally increased with increasing O3 exposure and was the principal cause of the decrease in leaf biomass of the O3-treated plants. Considerable genetic variation in O3 responses occurred, as shown by differences in sensitivities among clones and among seedlings. However, the responses to O3 of rooted cuttings and seedlings were similar when seedling means were compared with clonal means for leaf abscission, diameter growth, retained leaf biomass, and root biomass. Comparison of a single square-wave treatment (52 ppm-h) with 70 and 92 ppm-h episodic exposures suggested that the plant response to the square-wave exposure was similar to the response to the highest episodic exposure even though the 92 ppm-h episodic exposure was almost twice the square-wave exposure. Our results are consistent with previous studies that show that P iremuloides is highly responsive to O3 exposure and this response has a strong genetic component.",9.4.2,Visible Foliar Injury and Biomonitoring,8.2,Visible Foliar Injury and Biomonitoring

Six-d-old plants of an O3-sensitive population ('Valsain') were exposed to one of the following six treatments; 56 d charcoal/Purafll-filtered air (CFA): 56 d CFA plus 70 nmol mol-1 O3 for 7 h d-1; CFA with a 14-d episode of 0 administered at days 1, 14, 28 or 42. Harvests were made every 14 d, and at the final harvest (56 d) the influence of O3 on reproductive structures was assessed. Analysis of the effects of O3 on growth and reproductive performance confirmed the sensitivity of the population to the pollutant. In the absence of the development of typical visible symptoms of foliar damage, the total d. wt of plants maintained in O3 over a 56-d period was 35% lower than that of control plants. However, the impact of the pollutant was found to decrease as plants aged. Plant relative growth rate (R) was only affected in seedlings, suggesting that effects of O3 on seedling growth were largely responsible for the decrease in accumulated biomass; the growth rate of older plants was not affected by O3. The observed shift in O3 resistance with plant age was mediated by both 'acclimation' and ontogenetic changes. 'Acclimation' was not associated with changes in O3 uptake, and there was some evidence to support the existence of compensatory growth responses. In addition to effects on vegetative growth, plants exhibited an O3-induced decline in reproductive performance; O3 reducing the number of flower spikes and seed capsules produced per plant. Ozone episodes administered at different stages of development indicated that reproductive development was particularly sensitive to O3 during the early stages of flowering. The findings of this study are discussed in relation to evolutionary adaptation to O3 in natural plant communities The importance of plant age, prior exposure to the pollutant and the timing of O3 episodes in relation to plant developmental stage are highlighted.",9.4.3.3,Reproduction,0,0

The cellular O2.- accumulation is ethylene dependent, occurs ahead of the expanding lesions before visible symptoms appear, and is required for lesion propagation. Exogenous ethylene increased O2.- -dependent cell death, whereas impairment of ethylene perception by norbornadiene in rcdl or ethylene insensitivity in the ethylene-insensitive mutant ein2 and in the rcd1 ein2 double mutant blocked O2.- accumulation and lesion propagation. Exogenous methyl jasmonate inhibited propagation of cell death in rcd 1. Accordingly, the O3-exposed jasmonate-insensitive mutant jar1 displayed spreading cell death and a prolonged 02.- accumulation pattern. These results suggest that ethylene acts as a promoting factor during the propagation phase of developing oxyradical-dependent lesions, whereas jasmonates have a role in lesion containment, Interaction and balance between these pathways may serve to fine-tune propagation and containment processes, resulting in alternate lesion size and formation kinetics.",9.3.3.3,Role of Phytohormones in Plant Response to Ozone,0,0

In addition, two populations of P. major have been demonstrated to show an increase in ozone resistance after summers when ozone concentrations were high. However, if evolution of ozone resistance has occurred in the field there must be appropriate heritable genetic variation and this must be demonstrated. In the present study, artificial selection for ozone resistance and sensitivity was imposed on a resistant ('Lullington Heath') and sensitive ('Bush') population of P. major. Artificial selection is an efficient means of demonstrating additive genetic variance for a character. Selection was based on 2 wk growth in ozone (70 nI O(3)/l for 7 h d(-1)), and selected lines were tested for ozone resistance under both short and long term ozone exposures. Changes in ozone resistance were demonstrated for each population. On the basis of a 2-wk screening test, selection from the initially sensitive Bush population led to a line that was significantly more resistant to ozone, but it was not possible to select a line with greater sensitivity than the original population. Conversely, selection from the initially resistant Lullington Heath population led to a line with increased sensitivity but not to a line with increased resistance. Differences in ozone resistance between the selected lines were maintained over the long term and were reflected in growth and seed production at the final harvest. Net assimilation rate, stomatal conductance and leaf pigments were measured. In both populations the lines selected tor sensitivity showed a greater effect of ozone on net assimilation rate. Ozone had a minor effect on chlorophyll content in the Lullington Heath sensitive line but tended to increase carotenoid concentrations. However, this effect on carotenoids was not related to ozone resistance. The experiment demonstrated that ozone resistance in P. major is heritable.

Although ozone is suspected to be a respiratory carcinogen it is not regulated as a carcinogen in most countries. The genotoxic and inflammatory effects of ozone were investigated in female mice exposed to ozone for 90 min. The tail moment in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) cells from BALB/c mice was determined by the comet assay as a measure of DNA strand breaks. Within the first 200 min after exposure, the BAL cells from the mice exposed to 1 or 2 ppm ozone had 1.6- and 2.6-fold greater tail moments than unexposed mice. After 200 min there was no effect. It could be ruled out that the effect during the first 200 min was due to major infiltration of lymphocytes or neutrophils. Unexpectedly, ozone had no effect on the content of 8-oxo-deoxyguanosine (8-oxo-dG) in nuclear DNA or on oxidised amino acids in the lung tissue. The mRNA level of the repair enzyme ERCC1 was not increased in the lung tissue. Inflammation was measured by the cytokine mRNA level in lung homogenates. An up to 150-fold induction of interleukin-6 (IL-6) mRNA was detected in the animals exposed to 2 ppm ozone compared to the air-exposed control mice. Also at 1 ppm ozone, the IL-6 mRNA was induced. The large induction of IL-6 mRNA in the lung took place after DNA strand breaks were induced in BAL. This does not support the notion that inflammatory reactions are the cause of DNA damage. To determine whether these exposures were mutagenic, Muta(TM)Mice were exposed to 2 ppm ozone, 90 min per day for 5 days. No treatment-related mutations could be detected in the cII transgene. These results indicate that a short episode of ozone exposure at five times the threshold limit value (TLV) in US induces lung inflammatory mediators and DNA damage in the cells in the lumen of the lung.

The cocarcinogenicity study included subcutaneous administration of 0, 0.1, or 1.0 mg/kg body weight of 4-(N-nitrosomethylamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone (NNK) and inhalation of 0 or 0.5 ppm ozone to male rats. NNK was administered by subcutaneous injections 3 times per week for the first 20 wk with ozone inhalation exposure. The ozone inhalation exposure was for 2 yr (104 wk), including the first 20 wk of NNK treatment and continuing for 84 wk after the last NNK injection. Ozone exposure caused a concentration-related increase in inflammation of the centriacinar region of the lung. There was also increased fibrosis and an extension of the bronchiolar epithelium in these centriacinar regions to involve the proximal alveoli. There was no increased incidence of neoplasms at any site, including the lung, that was associated with ozone exposure. Rats administered 1.0 mg/kg body weight NNK alone had an increased incidence of bronchiolar/alveolar neoplasms, but this effect was not enhanced by ozone exposure. Ozone exposure for 2 yr and lifetime was associated with site-specific toxic alterations in the nasal passage and lung similar to those previously described for short-term exposures. While there was significant attenuation of the pulmonary lesions as compared to short-term exposures, lesions persisted in the lifetime study and there was evidence of a mild progressive fibrosis. We conclude that under the conditions of these studies: (a) ozone exposure is not carcinogenic to either male or female F-344/N rats,(b) ozone does not enhance the incidence of pulmonary neoplasms in F-344/N rats exposed to a known pulmonary carcinogen (NNK), and (c) mild site-specific toxic lesions characteristic of ozone exposure persist in the nasal passage and lung throughout the lifetime of the rat with continued ozone exposure.",7.6.1,Introduction,0,0

The results from two independent approaches ((a) statistical and (b) micrometeorological) were analyzed for understanding cause-effect relationships of the foliar injury responses of tobacco cv Bel-W3 to the exposure dynamics of ambient O(3) concentrations. Similarly, other results from two independent approaches were analyzed in: (1) establishing a micrometeorological relationship between hourly ambient O(3) concentrations and their vertical flux from the air into a natural grassland canopy; and (2) establishing a statistical relationship between hourly ambient O(3) concentrations in long-term, chronic exposures and crop yield reductions. Independent of the approach used, atmospheric conditions appeared to be most conducive and the crop response appeared to be best explained statistically by the cumulative frequency of hourly ambient O(3) concentrations between 50 ppb and 90 ppb (100 and 180 microg m(-3)). In general, this concentration range represents intermediate or moderately enhanced hourly O(3) values in a polluted environment. Further, the diurnal occurrence of this concentration range (often approximately between 0900 and 1600 h in a polluted, agricultural environment) coincided with the optimal CO(2) flux from the atmosphere into the crop canopy, thus high uptake. The frequency of occurrence of hourly O(3) concentrations &gt; 90 ppb (180 microg m(-3)) appeared to be of little importance and such concentrations in general appeared to occur during atmospheric conditions which did not facilitate optimal vertical flux into the crop canopy, thus low uptake. Alternatively, when &gt; 90 ppb (180 microg m(-3)) O(3) concentrations occurred during the 0900-1600 h window, their frequency of occurrence was low in comparison to the 50-90 ppb (100-180 microg m(-3)) range. Based on the overall results, we conclude that if the cumulative frequency of hourly ambient O(3) concentrations between 50-62 ppb (100-124 microg m(-3)) occurred during 53% of the growing season and the corresponding cumulative frequency of hourly O(3) concentrations between 50-74 ppb (100-148 microg m(-3)) occurred during 71% of the growing season, then yield reductions in sensitive crops could be expected, if other factors supporting growth, such as adequate soil moisture are not limiting.",9.2.3,Field Chambers,8.1.2.1.2,Field Chambers

Since O3 is a common air pollutant, an O3-induced alteration of mechanisms of drug action could have public health implications. It was shown that a 5-hr exposure to 1960 ?g O3/m3 (1 ppm) caused an increased PEN-induced S.T. in female mice (three strains), rats, and hamsters. This response was not observed in male rats or in male mice even when the latter were exposed for 5 hr/day for 3 days. Male hamsters were affected, but less so than females. Ozone concentration and time relationships were investigated in female mice. Concentrations from 196 to 9800 ?g O3/m3 (0.1 to 5 ppm) increased PEN-induced S.T. However, as the concentration was decreased, an increasing number of daily 3-hr exposures were needed to cause an effect. Once the maximal effect was observed, further daily exposures resulted in a dissipation or a disappearance of the effect. Also, recovery occurred within 24 hr after exposure ceased. Other experiments were performed in which mice received a continuous exposure to a C ? T (concentration ? time) of 5, ranging from 196 ?g/m3 (0.1 ppm) ? 50 hr to 1960 ?g/m3 (1 ppm) ? 5 hr. For most of the concentrations, the magnitudes of the O3 effects were roughly equivalent. These data are interpreted as a systemic effect of O3 on mechanisms of the termination of action of pentobarbital.",6.5.1,Effects on the Liver and Xenobiotic Metabolism,0,0

In addition, ratios of type I to type III collagen in the lungs of the same monkeys were also evaluated by cyanogen bromide peptide mapping techniques. We observed elevated levels of collagen in lungs of both species of animals exposed to ozone. We conclude that elevations in collagen synthesis rates in lungs of rats and monkeys acutely exposed to high levels of ozone are reflected by corresponding increases in lung collagen content over subchronic and chronic time frames. Preliminary results on young rats also suggest that removal of rats from atmospheres containing ozone does not cause reversal of such increases in lung collagen content.

The metabolic clearance of TSH was not altered during ozone exposure and the high TSH levels seen in thyroidectomized rats were also not affected. Circulating prolactin (PRL) levels were significantly elevated after exposure. Pituitary TSH and PRL content was considerably increased in ozone-exposed rats; however, only TSH was released significantly above control values in vitro. Thyroid weight was also significantly increased after exposure. The results suggest that the depression of the pituitary-thyroid axis may be an adaptive mechanism during ozone exposure by reducing hypothalamic stimulation via thyrotropin releasing hormone (TRH) and at the same time lifting the hypothalamic catecholamine inhibition on PRL release. Both may be necessary alterations in order to develop tolerance during ozone exposure.",6.4.1,Neuroendocrine Effects,5.1.2,Biological Plausibility

The pulmonary response was evaluated by means of pulmonary function testing, light microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, transmission microscopy, autoradiography, and morphometry. Pulmonary function values obtained before exposure did not statistically differ from values obtained after exposure. A general trend of increased quasistatic compliance of the lung was observed in both groups of exposed monkeys. Morphologic changes were principally characterized as low-grade chronic respiratory bronchiolitis. Major features were intraluminal accumulations of macrophages and hypertrophy and hyperplasia of cuboidal bronchiolar epithelial cells. The intensity of this inflammatory response was determined by counting the number of intraluminal inflammatory cells per millimeter of respiratory bronchiolar surface. The magnitude of inflammation was greatest at the 0.8 ppm ozone concentration at each exposure period; however, the number of inflammatory cells present at 90 days was less than one half that observed at 7 days, in spite of persistent ozone insult. Tritiated thymidine labeling and counts of respiratory bronchiolar epithelium demonstrated up to a 37-fold increase in labeling index at 7 days but only a sevenfold increase at 90 days. Differential cell counts demonstrated an increase in the proportion of cuboidal bronchiolar cells constituting the respiratory bronchiolar epithelium. In control monkeys, 60% of the epithelial cells were cuboidal bronchiolar cells. At 90 days of exposure, more than 90% of the respiratory bronchiolar cells were cuboidal in appearance. The cuboidal bronchiolar cell in control monkeys does not appear secretory, but membrane-bound electron-dense secretory granules are present in this cell type from exposed monkeys.

Total IgE cells increased 9.4-fold in mice that received aerosolized ovalbumin as compared to normal mice. When ozone exposure was added to the effects from aerosolized ovalbumin, the increase of IgE cells over normal was 34.2-fold.

One day old Fischer-344-rats were exposed to 0 or 0.25 part per million (ppm) ozone 12 hours per day for 6 weeks. At the end of the experimental period, the rats were killed, the lungs were removed, and the alveolar region was examined for histological changes. Morphometric techniques were used to quantitate structural changes in the proximal alveolar region, and the volume of tissue in this area was significantly increased after 6 weeks of exposure to 0.25ppm ozone. The changes in tissue volume were due to a 23 percent increase in type 1 epithelium, a 31 percent increase in type 2 epithelium, and a 154 percent increase in the volume of alveolar macrophages. The number of type 1 cells increased from 126 to 220 million cells per square millimeter (million/mm2). An average type 1 cell decreased in volume from 2,040 to 1,551 cubic micrometers. The arithmetic mean thickness of the epithelial layer increased from 0.250 to 0.311 micron. Morphological changes included rupture of the plasma membrane and sloughing off of the epithelium. Ozone caused an increase in type 2 cells from 224 to 300 million/mm2. The other cell parameters were not changed, relative to controls. Ozone exposure increased the number of alveolar macrophages from 43 to 85 million/mm2. The macrophages were extensively vacuolated and contained numerous lysosomes in their cytoplasm.

Part IX: Changes in the tracheobronchial epithelium, pulmonary acinus, and lung antioxidant enzyme activity","Pinkerton, KE; Menache, MG; Plopper, CG",1995,"The effect of ozone on the respiratory system is not confined to a single region or a specific cell type. Ozone-induced injury can occur at all levels of the respiratory system. However, the effects of this oxidant gas throughout the tracheobronchial tree and the lung parenchyma can be highly variable. The doses of ozone delivered to the various regions may also be different, and these differences may have a significant effect on the extent of injury. To examine the effects of chronic exposure to ozone on the lungs, we used a systematic sampling approach to perform morphometric, histochemical, and enzymatic analyses of selected airway generations and pulmonary acini arising from short and long airway paths of the tracheobronchial tree. The objectives of this study were to define compositional, cytochemical, and architectural changes that occur in epithelial cells of the airways and major tissue components of the pulmonary acini after 20 months of exposure to 0.0, 0.12, 0.5, or 1.0 parts per million (ppm)* ozone in male and female F344/N rats. We found in the trachea and bronchi significant alterations in stored secretory product following exposure to ozone, but no changes in epithelial thickness or the volume density of nonciliated cells. The volume density of nonciliated cells was significantly increased in terminal bronchioles arising from a long airway path (caudal region) of the left lung. The predominant change within the pulmonary acini was the extension of bronchiolar epithelium beyond the bronchiole-alveolar duct junction into alveoli. This change was concentration-dependent and site-specific, with ventilatory units arising from a short path (cranial region) of the left lung in male rats being most affected. The antioxidant enzymes superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase, and glutathione S-transferase were significantly elevated in the distal bronchiole to central acinus following 20 months of exposure to 0.5 or 1.0 ppm ozone. Changes in antioxidant enzyme levels were more variable in other airway generations. We conclude that the effects of long-term (20-month) exposure to ozone are dose-dependent and site-specific along the tracheobronchial tree and pulmonary acini of the lungs. With the tissue sampling strategies used in this study, for the first time microdosimetric relations between ozone concentrations and biological changes in precisely delineated regions of the lungs can be defined along the entire lower respiratory tract.",7.2.3.2,Pulmonary Structure and Function: Evidence from Toxicological Studies and Nonhuman Primate Asthma Models,0,0

Blocks of tissue selected throughout the lung and from first generation RBs following airway microdissection had the following significant exposure-related changes: 57% greater volume of RB in the lung, 27% smaller diameter of RB lumen, 179% thicker media and intima of peribronchiolar arterioles, 61% thicker RB epithelium, and 77% thicker PCT. The increase in thickness of the RB wall resulted primarily from an 84% increase in PCT, with the remainder from the epithelium. Estimates of cellular numerical density showed an 81% increase in cuboidal bronchiolar cells and an 87% decrease in type 1 pneumocytes in the exposed group. Cell volumes from serial section reconstruction showed significantly larger cuboidal bronchiolar (79%), ciliated (117%), and type 2 (66%) cells over controls.

Since the area of the junction of the conductive and respiratory regions of the lung has been reported as the major site of injury due to O3 inhalation, techniques were devised to specifically study alveolar tissue from this region. One-day-old or 6-week-old male rats were exposed to either 0.25 ppm O3 12 hours/day or to continuous room air for 6 weeks. An additional group of 6-week-old rats were exposed to 0.12 ppm O3 for the same time period. All lungs were fixed at the end of the exposure by intratracheal installation of buffered 2% glutaraldehyde. Cylinders of tissue containing a cross-section of a terminal bronchiole were punched out of lung tissue slices using a sharpened cannula. These tissue cylinders were oriented, embedded in Epon, serial sectioned until the first alveolar duct bifurcation was reached, and then thin sectioned for electron microscopy. Qualitative examination of the tissue revealed little observable damage to the proximal alveolar tissues. However, by ultrastructure morphometric analysis, significant changes occurred in the alveolar epithelium of the proximal alveolar region of all exposed animals. In the animals exposed to 0.25 ppm O3 from 1 day of age (juvenile animals), the number of type 1 epithelial cells doubled, their mean surface area decreased 38%, and their mean thickness increased 24%. The number of alveolar type 2 epithelial cells increased, and the number of alveolar macrophages doubled. Adult animals exposed to 0.25 ppm O3 showed similar patterns of changes in the epithelium of the proximal alveolar region and in addition had a doubling of interstitial macrophages, indicating a mild inflammatory stimulus in the interstitium. Adult animals exposed to 0.12 ppm O3 showed smaller, but statistically significant changes in the alveolar type 1 epithelium, suggesting a relatively linear concentration-response relationship. The change in number and size of type 1 cells in all exposed animals is consistent with an increased cell turnover rate due to prolonged O3 inhalation. These results suggest that low concentrations of O3 cause a chronic epithelial injury in the proximal alveolar region and that the extent of these changes occurs in a concentration-dependent manner, even at concentrations as low as 0.12 ppm.

All these factors have a spatial nature, and consequently an approach to characterization of ozone risk is presented that places ozone exposure-response functions for species as seedlings and model-simulated tree and stand responses in a spatial context using a geographical information systems (GIS). The GIS is used to aggregate factors considered important in a risk characterization, including: (1) estimated ozone exposures over forested regions, (2) measures of ozone effects on species' and stand growth, and (3) spatially distributed environmental, genetic, and exposure influences on species' response to ozone. The GIS-based risk characterization provides an estimation of the extent and magnitude of the potential ozone impact on forests. A preliminary risk characterization demonstrating this approach considered only the eastern United States and only the limited empirical data quantifying the effect of ozone exposures on forest tree species as seedlings. The area-weighted response of the annual seedling biomass loss formed the basis for a sensitivity ranking: sensitive - aspen and black cherry (14%-33% biomass loss over 50% of their distribution); moderately sensitive - tulip popular, loblolly pine, eastern white pine, and sugar maple (5%-13% biomass loss); insensitive - Virginia pine and red maple (0%-1% loss). In the future, the GIS-based risk characterization will include process-based model simulations of the three- to 5-year growth response of individual species as large trees with relevant environmental interactions and model simulated response of mixed stands.

These studies are based on retrospective statistical analyses of data from the U.S. NCLAN (National Crop Loss Assessment Network) and the EOTCP (European Open-Top Chambers Programme). In these investigations, a sigmoidal O-3 concentration weighting function and/or different types of summation techniques have been used. For example, in the U.S., from a regulatory perspective, one of the descriptors of O-3 exposure is SUM06 (sum of all hourly concentrations above 60 ppb). Based on this statistic, it was predicted that a three month growing season SUM06 value of 26.4 ppm cntdot hours of O-3 would protect 50% of the crops from yield losses of gt 10%. In contrast, in the UN-ECE studies, an exposure index or critical level of AOT40 (Accumulated exposure Over Threshold of 40 ppb) was selected as the best predictor of adverse crop response and has been used to predict yield losses in spring wheat, green beans and clover. Most recently we have also statistically analyzed both the NCLAN and the EOTCP data retrospectively. The results showed that the cumulative frequency of occurrence of intermediate or moderate hourly O-3 concentrations is important in crop yield loss response. While our NCLAN data analysis showed that the cumulative frequency of occurrence of hourly O-3 concentrations between 50 and 87 ppb is the best predictor of crop response in the U.S., the corresponding results from EOTCP showed a range of 35 to 60 ppb as being important in Europe. There is a debate at the present time as to whether peak or moderate O-3 concentrations are critical in causing crop yield reductions. The resolution of this issue is related to O-3 concentrations that occur when both the atmosphere and the phytosphere are sufficiently conductive for optimal O-3 flux (exposure potential) and uptake. In this context, summary results from a number of independent studies are reviewed to further underscore the significance of moderate O-3 concentrations. In addition, results on the relevance of moderate or intermediate O-3 concentrations are explained in this paper with the use of an independent hybrid, statistical-mechanistic (micro-meteorological) approach. Here the concept includes the importance of ambient O-3 concentrations as they relate to the atmospheric conductivity and the physiological and functional properties of the plant. Further, we provide the numerical equations for applying this approach in O-3 measurement networks, the results of which, can be coupled with crop specific biology by using descriptors such as the ""growing degree days."" It is concluded that these types of efforts will be very valuable in significantly reducing the current controversy associated with the presently popular single point, statistical cause-effect models and the scaled uncertainties consequently associated with regional scale assessments of ambient O-3-induced crop loss through the application of such models.",9.2.3,Field Chambers,8.1.2.1.2,Field Chambers

Using data obtained during the summer of 1991 at a grape vineyard and a cotton field in the San Joaquin Valley of California, we compare canopy (stomatal) conductances to ozone estimated (1) from eddy covariance ozone flux data (2) from eddy covariance evapotranspiration data and (3) by scaling leaf transpirational conductance to the canopy level using a canopy radiative transfer model. These simultaneous data, obtained at two levels of biological organization and for two trace gases, allow us to contrast the pathways for canopy-atmosphere exchange of water vapour and ozone, to evaluate limitations to scaling from leaf to canopy, and to predict ozone uptake parameters from those governing transpiration. At the vineyard site the eddy covariance ozone results underestimate the ET-based (eddy covariance and leaf scaling) approaches between 25% and 36%. At the cotton site the ozone-based results overestimate the ET-based approaches between 9% and 62%. A number of modelling and measurement uncertainties are of appropriate magnitude to reconcile these estimates. Some of the possible causes for these discrepancies that are discussed include NO effects, mesophyll resistances to ozone uptake and flaws in the K-theory (first-order closure) approach on which the canopy-scale analysis is based. Nevertheless, both canopy and single leaf measurements of conductance for water vapour provide acceptable estimates of conductance for ozone, but further experiments in which all are measured simultaneously are suggested.",9.3.2,Ozone Uptake into the Leaf,0,0

40707,,,,Simulating ozone effects on forest productivity: Interactions among leaf- and stand-level processes,"Ollinger, SV; Aber, JD; Reich, PB",1997,"#Ozone pollution in the lower atmosphere is known to have adverse effects on forest vegetation, but the degree to which mature forests are impacted has been very difficult to assess directly. In this study, we combined leaf-level ozone response data from independent ozone fumigation studies with a forest ecosystem model in order simulate the effects of ambient ozone on mature hardwood forests. Reductions in leaf carbon gain were determined as a linear function of ozone flux to the leaf interior, calculated as the product of ozone concentration and leaf stomatal conductance. This relationship was applied to individual canopy layers within the model in order to allow interaction with stand- and canopy-level factors such as light attenuation, leaf morphology, soil water limitations, and vertical ozone gradients.
The resulting model was applied to 64 locations across the northeastern United States using ambient ozone data from 1987 to 1992. Predicted declines in annual net primary production ranged from 3 to 16% with greatest reductions in southern portions of the region where ozone levels were highest, and on soils with high water-holding capacity where drought stress was absent. Reductions in predicted wood growth were slightly greater (3u22%) because wood is a lower carbon allocation priority in the model than leaf and root growth. Interannual variation in predicted ozone effects was small due to concurrent fluctuations in ozone and climate. Periods of high ozone often coincided with hot, dry weather conditions, causing reduced stomatal conductance and ozone uptake. Within-canopy ozone concentration gradients had little effect on predicted growth reductions because concentrations remained high through upper canopy layers where net carbon assimilation and ozone uptake were greatest.
Sensitivity analyses indicate a trade-off between model sensitivity to available soil water and foliar nitrogen and demonstrate uncertainties regarding several assumptions used in the model. Uncertainties surrounding ozone effects on stomatal function and plant water use efficiency were found to have important implications on current predictions. Field measurements of ozone effects on mature forests will be needed before the accuracy of model predictions can be fully assessed.",9.4.3.4,Ecosystem Productivity and Carbon Sequestration,0,0

After acute exposure to 1.2 ppm, a marked increase in lavaged neutrophils was observed at 24 h. A single exposure to 0.1 ppm resulted in increased AM at 7 d, while repeated exposures resulted in an increase in AM and neutrophils on d 7 and 14. AM phagocytosis was depressed immediately and 24 h after acute exposure to 0.1 ppm, and at all time points after exposure to 1.2 ppm.

One group was killed immediately after the exposure period; the second exposed group breathed filtered air for 6 months after the ozone exposure before being killed. Previous studies of these monkeys had revealed that lung collagen content was increased in both exposed groups (J.A. Last et al., (1984). Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol. 72, 111-118). In the present study specific collagen crosslinks were quantified in order to determine whether the excess collagen in the lungs of these animals was structurally normal or abnormal. In the group killed immediately after exposure, the difunctional crosslink dehydrodihydroxylysinonorleucine (DHLNL) was elevated, as was the ratio of DHLNL to dehydrohydroxylysinonorleucine (HLNL). Lung content of the mature nonreducible crosslink hydroxypyridinium was also increased in this group. In the group killed after a 6-month postexposure period, lung content of the difunctional crosslinks DHLNL and HLNL was indistinguishable from control values. However, lung hydroxypyridinium content was significantly increased. The changes in collagen crosslinking observed in the group killed at the termination of exposure are characteristic of those seen in lung tissue in the acute stage of experimental pulmonary fibrosis. The changes seen in the postexposure group suggest that while the lung collagen being synthesized at the time the animals were killed was apparently normal, ""abnormal"" collagen synthesized during the period of ozone exposure was irreversibly deposited in the lungs. This study suggests that long-term exposure to relatively low levels of ozone may cause irreversible changes in lung collagen structure.",7.2.3.2,Pulmonary Structure and Function: Evidence from Toxicological Studies and Nonhuman Primate Asthma Models,0,0

With TREGRO, we estimated whether the reduction in the supply of carbon caused by ozone exposure would prevent an individual tree from meeting its demands for carbon for growth. With ZELIG, we analyzed the effect that changes in individual tree growth have in altering the ability of trees to successfully compete during forest succession. Current ambient levels of ozone measured at mid-elevations on the west side of GSMNP were predicted to reduce the abundance of yellow-poplar by 10% over the next 100 yr. This reduction would accelerate declines that are expected because of natural successional change. An increase of ozone of 50% above current ambient conditions was predicted to decrease yellow-poplar abundance by 30%. A reduction of ozone to halfambient levels was insufficient to prevent yellow-poplar abundance decreases. Increases in abundance in two other canopy dominants, red maple (Acer rubrum L.) and black cherry (Prunus serotina Ehrh.) were predicted from the release from competition as yellow-poplar was suppressed by ozone exposure. These increases, however, were predicted to be short-lived, with large decreases of up to 30% eventually occurring for both species.

Soil respiration, soil pCO2, and dissolved organic carbon in soil solution (DOC) were monitored biweekly. Soil respiration was measured with a portable infrared gas analyzer. Soil pCO2 and DOC samples were collected from soil gas wells and tension lysimeters, respectively, at depths of 15, 30, and 125 cm. Fine-root biomass averaged 263 g m-2 in control plots and increased 96% under elevated CO2. The increased root biomass was accompanied by a 39% increase in soil respiration and a 27% increase in soil pCO2. Both soil respiration and pCO2 exhibited a strong seasonal signal, which was positively correlated with soil temperature. DOC concentrations in soil solution averaged ~12 mg l-1 in surface horizons, declined with depth, and were little affected by the treatments.

We conclude that regenerating stands of northern hardwoods have the potential for substantially greater C input to soil due to greater fine-root production under elevated CO2. Greater fine-root biomass will be accompanied by greater soil C efflux as soil respiration, but leaching losses of C will probably be unaffected.",9.4.3.1,Plant Growth and Biomass Allocation,8.3,Plant Growth

Sixweek-old Fisher 344 rats were exposed to O3 in two different subchronic low-level exposure patterns. The first was a 12 hr/day exposure for 6 weeks and included two O3 concentrations, 0.12 and 0.25 ppm. The second consisted of an exposure profile having a background level of 0.06 ppm with a 9-hr period. Rats given the second exposure pattern were exposed for either 3 or 13 weeks. Changes in the volumes of alveolar epithelium were found to be consistent and reproducible markers for cell injury and/or response. Results from the first study indicated that the relative volume of the type I epithelium increased 13 and 23% over the control value (p < 0.05) following exposures for 6 weeks to 0.12 and 0.25 ppm, respectively. The magnitude of the increases were clearly concentration related. Similarly, when a fixed exposure concentration was employed the relative volume of type I epithelium was found to increase in proportion to the exposure time. In the second exposure, increases of 9 and 33% in relative volume of type I epithelium were found respectively after 3 and 13 weeks of exposure. If the total exposure determined by the product of O3 concentration (including background) and exposure time is plotted against the relative volume of type I epithelium from both the 0.12 ppm (60.5 ppm-hr) and 0.25 ppm (126 ppm-hr) exposures and the 3-week (45.3 ppm-hrs) and 13-week (196.2 ppm-hr) exposures, a linear relationship between increases in type I cell volume and the concentration ? time product is observed. The coefficient of correlation (r2) for the linear regression of the animal means is 0.72. Changes in the volume of Type II epithelial cell also correlate with the concentration ? time product (r2 = 0.66). This suggests that epithelial cell reactions to low-level subchronic exposure of O3 are directly related to the cumulative oxidant concentration. The pattern of exposure did not appear to affect the resulting degree of injury. Furthermore, a low level of background exposure may contribute to the epithelial cell injuries.",7.2.3.2,Pulmonary Structure and Function: Evidence from Toxicological Studies and Nonhuman Primate Asthma Models,0,0

The ozone-mediated abatement of the lung injury was independent of peak pulmonary virus titers. However, determination of the sites of virus multiplication indicated that exposure to ozone resulted in a less widespread infection of the lung parenchyma. Furthermore, ozone exposure reduced the antiviral immune response as shown by reduced numbers of phenotypically quantitated T- and B-lymphocytes recovered from lung tissues and reduction of serum antibody titers. Since the pathogenesis of influenza virus infection depends on both the site of viral replication and the antiviral immune response, these studies suggest that redistribution of virus growth in murine lungs and immunosuppressive mechanisms are factors in the ozone-reduced disease severity.",6.2.5.4,Infection and Adaptive Immunity ,0,0

For this purpose rats were continuously exposed to O3 concentrations ranging from 0.25 to 2.0 mg/m3 for a period of 1 week. In this model defense to a respiratory infection with Listeria depends on acquired specific cellular immune responses, as well as on natural nonspecific defense mechanisms. The results confirm earlier findings that show that ozone exposure can suppress the capacity of macrophages to ingest and kill Listeria. Moreover, the results show that ozone can also have a suppressive effect on the development of cellular immune responses to a respiratory Listeria infection, i.e., on T/B ratios in lung draining lymph nodes, delayed-type hypersensitivity responses to Listeria antigen, and lymphoproliferative responses in spleen and lung draining lymph nodes to Listeria antigen. The effects on the specific immune responses are especially overt if exposure to the oxidant gas occurs during an ongoing primary infection. The pathological lesions induced by a pulmonary Listeria monocytogenes infection were characterized by multifocal infiltrates of histiocytic and lymphoid cells. The foci sometimes had a granulomatous appearance. Moreover, the cellularity of the interstitial tissues was increased. In the lung many diffuse alveolar macrophages could be seen in the alveoli. Ozone exposure greatly increased the severity of the lung lesions and also of liver lesions resulting from the pulmonary infection. A prominent finding was the formation of granulomas in ozone-exposed and Listeria-infected rats. This increased severity of the lesions after ozone exposure and subsequent infection with Listeria was presumably not a result of additive ozone and Listeria-induced lesions, but rather an effect of ozone-induced impaired clearance of the bacteria, caused by depressed macrophage activity and cellular immunity. T-cell-dependent immune responses form an important component of defense to respiratory infections with bacteria and viruses, and possibly also to neoplasms. Since our study unequivocally shows an effect on T-cell-dependent immunity, ozone exposure has to be judged potentially hazardous with respect to such challenges of the lung.",6.2.5.4,Infection and Adaptive Immunity ,0,0

Noninfected control mice were exposed to either ambient air or ozone. On various days during the first month after infection, groups of mice were sacrificed and their lungs assessed for acute injury (lung lavage albumin, total and differential cell counts, wet/dry ratios, and morphometry).

After Day 30 a shift in the character of the pulmonary lesions was observed in that continuous exposure to ozone potentiated the postinfluenzal alveolitis and structural changes in the lung parenchyma.

Results of this study indicated that continuous ozone exposure for 1, 5, or 7 days resulted in a significant decrease in pulmonary NK activity. This suppressed pulmonary NK activity returned to control levels after continuous exposure to ozone for 10 days. The suppressed pulmonary NK response was thus attenuated and returned to normal values in the continued presence of ozone gas. This attenuation process is dynamic, complex, and doubtless involves several cell types and/or products of these cells.

It is super-sensitive to O(3) and may produce easily recognizable symptoms for several weeks on the new, fully expanded leaves. Bel-B and Bel-C, tolerant and sensitive to O(3), respectively, are sometimes used along with Bel-W3. Information is provided on the origin and nature of these varieties. This includes their use as indicators of elevated O(3) concentrations, strength and limitations, and the inheritance and nature of resistance to O(3) in Bel-B. The varieties were the product of research initiated in 1957 to determine the cause and to reduce losses from tobacco weather fleck. Bel-C and Bel-B display the classical upper leaf surface injury; whereas, Bel-W3 develops primarily bifacial lesions. Data are provided to show differences in the amounts of acute and chronic injury on each variety when exposed to different O(3) exposure doses in controlled environments and under field conditions. There is discussion of the influence of environmental factors on response to O(3) by the varieties and the possibility of synergistic action of O(3) and SO(3) when tobacco is exposed to mixtures of these gases. The methods and results obtained with Bel-W3 in the Dutch National Monitoring Network for Air Pollution are presented in detail.

To evaluate which age group is more susceptible to the adverse health effects of air pollution, we compared the effects of air pollution on mortality among postneonates, those aged 2 to 64 years, and those over 65 years of age. DESIGN: Daily counts of total and respiratory death along with daily levels of meteorological variables and air pollutants were analyzed using generalized additive Poisson regression. The relative risks (RR) of mortality for interquartile changes of the levels of particulate matter <10 micro m (PM(10)) were calculated on the same day. RESULTS: For postneonates, the RR of total mortality for an interquartile change (42.9 micro g/m(3)) in PM(10) (RR: 1.142; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.096-1.190) was greatest among age groups. Next were the elderly over 65 years of age (RR: 1.023; 95% CI: 1.022-1.024). Regarding respiratory mortality, RR for an interquartile change of PM(10) in postneonates (RR: 2.018; 95% CI: 1.784-2.283) was also greater than those in the other groups.

Mid-canopy measures of diurnal foliar stomatal conductance (gs) were taken in June and August in 1999. In early summer, there was little difference between trees in either microsite with regard to gs (55 mmol H2O mu2su1), canopy transpiration (4.0 l hu1), and total duration of active transpiration (12 h >0.03 l hu1). In late summer, xeric trees had a lower daily maximum gs (by 30%), a greater reduction in whole canopy transpiration relative to the seasonal maximum (66 vs 79%), and stomata were open 2 h less per day than in mesic trees. Based on leaf-level gas exchange measurements, trees in mesic sites had an estimated 46% decrease in O3 uptake from June to August.

We describe a prototype FACE system currently in operation in forest plots in a maturing loblolly pine(Pinus taeda L.) stand in North Carolina, USA. The system uses feedback control technology to control [CO2] in a 26 m diameter forest plot that is over 10 m tall, while monitoring the 3D plot volume to characterize the whole-stand CO2 regime achieved during enrichment. in the second summer season of operation of the FACE system, atmospheric CO2 enrichment was conducted in the forest during all daylight hours for 96.7% of the scheduled running time from 23 May to 14 October with a preset target [CO2] of 550 mu mol mol(-1), approximate to 200 mu mol mol(-1) above ambient [CO2]. The system provided spatial and temporal control of [CO2] similar to that reported for open-top chambers over trees, but without enclosing the vegetation. The daily average daytime [CO2] within the upper forest canopy at the centre of the FACE plot was 552 +/- 9 mu mol mol-l (mean +/- SD). The FACE system maintained I-minute average [CO2] to within +/- 110 mu mol mol(-1) of the target [CO2] for 92% of the operating time. Deviations of [CO2] outside of this range were short-lived (most lasting &lt; 60 s) and rare, with fewer than 4 excursion events of a minute or longer per day. Acceptable spatial control of [CO2] by the system was achieved,,with over 90% of the entire canopy volume within +/- 10% of the target [CO2] over the exposure season. CO2 consumption by the FACE system was much higher than for open-top chambers on an absolute basis, but similar to that of open-top chambers and branch bag chambers on a per unit volume basis. CO2 consumption by the FACE system was strongly related to windspeed, averaging 50 g CO2 m(-3) h(-1) for thestand for an average windspeed of 1.5 m s(-1) during summer. The [CO2] control results show that the free-air approach is a tractable way to study long-term and short-term alterations in trace gases, even within entire tall forest ecosystems. The FACE approach permits the study of a wide range of forest stand and ecosystem processes under manipulated [CO2](a) that were previously impossible or intractable to study in true forest ecosystems.",9.2.4,Plume and FACE-Type Systems,8.1.2.1.3,Free Air Carbon Dioxide/Ozone Enrichment (FACE) and Plume Type Systems

Foliar injury, chlorophyll, and forage weight responses of two clones of white clover (Trifolium repens L.) to ambient O3 were compared for plants grown in charcoal-filtered (CF) and nonfiltered air (NF) in a greenhouse and open-top field chambers and in ambient air (AA) plots at Raleigh, NC. One clone is sensitive to O3 (NC-S), whereas the other is resistant (NC-R). Comparisons of individual clone responses in CF vs. NF treatments in the greenhouse and in the field and the proportional response of the clones (defined as the NC-S/NC-R response ratio) were used to indicate the relative response to O3 in the different environments. Foliar injury and chlorophyll responses of NC-S to O3 were similar in the NF greenhouse, NT open-top chambers, and in AA. However, for individual harvests, the percentage decrease in NC-S forage weight in NF compared with CF was 7 to 23% greater in the greenhouse than in open-top chambers. The NC-S/NC-R forage ratios indicated that clover response to O3 in NF open-top field chambers was the same as in AA. Large environmental differences between greenhouse and open-top chambers apparently caused differences in plant responses to O3, whereas relatively small environmental differences between open-top chambers and ambient air did not.",9.2.3,Field Chambers,0,0

Three plots containing 30 trees of each species were established adjacent to air quality monitoring stations located at three different elevations. The symptom response of black cherry was most clearly correlated with ozone exposure. The best-fit regression model describing the relationship between cumulative ozone exposures and foliar injury was quadratic (y= a + bx2 + e); the most significant relationships were foliar injury versus the cumulative ozone concentrations of ?=60 ppb and the cumulative ozone concentrations weighted by a sigmoidal function. These observations suggest that higher ozone exposures are more important to foliar symptom development, but cumulatively all exposures contribute to the effect. In 1992, the progression of symptom development on10 black cherry trees at each site was observed and related to cumulative ozone; there was an exponential increase of foliar injury with cumulative ozone throughout the summer. In 1993, eight subplots of five black cherry saplings were established, and ozone-induced symptom incidence and severity was compared with those on overstory trees at associated trend plots. There was no significant difference in symptom expression between overstory and sapling trees; therefore, Park Service personnel can use the more accessible saplings instead of overstory trees to monitor ozone symptoms in the Park.",9.4.2,Visible Foliar Injury and Biomonitoring,8.2,Visible Foliar Injury and Biomonitoring

While pulmonary function decrements occur almost immediately after ozone exposure, it is not known how quickly the cellular and biochemical changes indicative of inflammation occur in humans. Increased bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid levels of neutrophils (PMNs) and prostaglandins (PGE2) have been reported in humans as early as 3 hr and as late as 18 hr after exposure. The purpose of this study was to determine whether a broad range of inflammatory mediators are elevated in BAL fluid within 1 hr of exposure. We exposed eight healthy volunteers twice: once to 0.4 ppm ozone and once to filtered air. Each exposure lasted for 2 hr during which the subjects underwent intermittent heavy exercise (66 liters/min). BAL was performed 1 hr after the exposure. Ozone induced rapid increases in PMNs, total protein, LDH, -1 antitrypsin, fibronectin, PGE2, thromboxane B2, C3a, tissue factor, and clotting factor VII. In addition, there was a decrease in the recovery of total cells and alveolar macrophages, and decreased ability of alveolar macrophages to phagocytizeCandida albicans.A comparison of these changes with changes observed in an earlier study in which subjects underwent BAL 18 hr after an identical exposure regimen indicates that IL-6 and PGE2levels were higher 1 hr after exposure than 18 hr after exposure, fibronectin and tissue-plasminogen activator levels were higher 18 hr after exposure, and that PMNs, protein, and C3a were present at essentially the same levels at both times. These results indicate that (i) several inflammatory mediators are already elevated 1 hr after exposure; (ii) some mediators achieve their maximal levels in BAL fluid at different times following exposure.

Leaf injury occurred in both lines when the molar ratio of putrescine to 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid or ethylene fell short of a certain threshold value. Monocaffeoyl-putrescine, an effective scavenger for oxyradicals, was detected in the apo-plastic fluid of the leaves of cv Bel B and increased upon exposure to ozone.

Comparison of the effect of ozone on dry matter partitioning at different stages of growth suggested that at each stage in development, ozone relatively strengthened the currently dominant sink, therefore reducing allocation tosubsidiary sinks. As a plant develops, the relative strengths of sources and sinks change so the effects of an ozone episode on allocation will depend upon the timing. It is concluded that the commonly held view that ozone tends to reduce root growth more than shoot may be an over-simplification. For native plants growing in the field, the timing of episodes in relation to development may be crucial to understanding ozone impact. On the ecosystem level we need knowledge of response and source-sink relationships at times of the year when episodes occur.",9.4.3.3,Reproduction,0,0

The ozone deposition data were obtained above and within the forest canopy. The deposition process was affected by solar radiation, wind speed and ambient ozone concentration. Solar radiation was likely acting through its influence on stomatal opening and wind speed through its effects on bulk boundary layer resistance. Ozone deposition deep in the canopy was negligibly small compared with that in the upper canopy. The difference is ascribed to a larger biological sink for ozone in the upper canopy and to a lack of efficient transport in the lower canopy. Substantial ozone deposition was measured while the forest canopy remained wet with either dew or rain water, during night-time and daytime conditions. This is contrary to assumptions made in some deposition models that ozone uptake is reduced when foliage is wet.",9.3.2,Ozone Uptake into the Leaf,0,0

As ozone effects depend on genotype, the ability to predict these effects on forest carbon cycling via competitive response between genotypes will also be required. This study tests a process-based model that predicts the relative effects of ozone on the photosynthetic rate and growth of an ozone-sensitive aspen clone, as a first step in simulating the competitive response of genotypes to atmospheric and climate change. The resulting composite model simulated the relative above ground growth response of ozone-sensitive aspen clone 259 exposed to square wave variation in ozone concentration. This included a greater effect on stem diameter than on stem height, earlier leaf abscission, and reduced stem and leaf dry matter production at the end of the growing season.

The objective of this research was to test the ozone sensitivity of selected conifer species under controlled exposure conditions. Seedlings of three species of conifers, Table Mountain pine (Pinus pungens), Virginia pine (Pinus virginiana), and eastern hemlock (Tsuga canadensis), were exposed to various levels of ozone in open-top chambers for one to three seasons in Great Smoky Mountains National Park in Tennessee, USA. A combination of episodic profiles (1988) and modified ambient exposure regimes (1989-92) were used. Episodic profiles simulated an average 7-day period from a monitoring station in the Park. Treatments used in 1988 were: charcoal-filtered (CF), 1.0I ambient, 2.0I ambient, and ambient airuno chamber (AA). In 1989 a 1.5I ambient treatment was added, and in 1990, additional chambers were made available, allowing a 0.5I ambient treatment to be added. Height, diameter, and foliar injury were measured most years. Exposures were 3 years for Table Mountain pine (1988-90), 3 years for hemlock (1989-91), and 1 and 2 years for three different sets of Virginia pine (1990, 1990-91, and 1992). There were no significant (p<0.05) effects of ozone on any biomass fraction for any of the species, except for older needles in Table Mountain and Virginia pine, which decreased with ozone exposure. There were also no changes in biomass allocation patterns among species due to ozone exposure, except for Virginia pine in 1990, which showed an increase in the root:shoot ratio. There was foliar injury (chlorotic mottling) in the higher two treatments (1.0I and 2.0I for Table Mountain and 2.0I for Virginia pine), but high plant-to-plant variability obscured formal statistical significance in many cases. We conclude, at least for growth in the short-term, that seedlings of these three conifer species are insensitive to ambient and elevated levels of ozone, and that current levels of ozone in the Park are probably having minimal impacts on these particular species.",9.2.3,Field Chambers,8.2,Visible Foliar Injury and Biomonitoring

The purpose of this study was to establish whether the development of tolerance to long-term exposure is associated with changes in the tracheobronchial epithelium. Male F344-N rats were exposed to 0, 0.12, 0.5, or 1.0 ppm ozone 6 hours/day for 5 days/week for 20 months and killed 1 week post-exposure. Samples for light microscopic morphometry were obtained by microdissection from each infusion-fixed trachea and left lung lobe and included: 1) a cranial bronchus with short path length (generation no. 4 to 5) and small diameter; 2) a central bronchus with short path length (generation no. 4 to 5) and large diameter; and 3) a caudal bronchus with long path length (generation no. 10 to 12) and small diameter. In addition, three sites within the central acinus were examined from cranial, central, and caudal regions. These sites included terminal bronchiole, 0.5 to 1 mm proximal to terminal bronchiole and bronchiolarized alveolar duct. Intraepithelial mucin storage (AB/PAS-positive material quantified by image analysis) within the trachea decreased with dose. Mucin storage was unchanged in the central bronchus, increased threefold with dose in the caudal bronchus, and was six times higher in the cranial bronchus at 1.0 ppm ozone. Epithelial composition was unchanged in trachea or any bronchi; however, we noted a significant dose-dependent increase in nonciliated cell mass and volume fraction in terminal bronchioles in all three regions. There was also a significant increase in nonciliated cell mass in the bronchiolarized alveolar ducts. Bronchiolar nonciliated cells were identified greater than fourfold further into alveolar ducts in 1.0 ppm exposed than in 0 ppm animals. Nonciliated cells occurred almost 200 microns deeper into alveolar ducts in cranial regions than in caudal regions. We conclude: 1) that the development of tolerance to injury produced by long-term exposure to ozone involves changes in airway epithelium and 2) that these changes are site specific and involve alterations in both secretory activity and cellular composition.",7.2.3.2,Pulmonary Structure and Function: Evidence from Toxicological Studies and Nonhuman Primate Asthma Models,0,0

The present study explores the molecular bases for this differential O(3) susceptibility by studying the expression of proteins associated to the epithelial lining fluid (ELF) from two strains of mice, C57BL/6J and the C3H/HeJ, respectively described as O(3)-sensitive and O(3)-resistant. The ELF proteins of these two strains were displayed by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DE) of bronchoalveolar lavage fluids (BALFs) and the protein patterns obtained with BALF samples of both strains were compared. Two major differences were observed between the BALF 2-DE protein maps obtained from C57BL/6J and C3H/HeJ strains. First, two isoforms of the antioxidant protein 2 (AOP2) were detected in a strain-dependent manner: C3J/HeJ possesses only AOP2a (isoelectric point 5.7) and C57BL/6J exhibits only AOP2b (isoelectric point 6.0). Second, the levels of anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive Clara cell protein-16 (CC16) were 1.3 times higher in the BALF from resistant C3H/HeJ than from sensitive C57BL/6 mice. Moreover, two 6 kDa isoforms of CC16 with isoelectric points of 4.9 (CC16a) and 5.2 (CC16b) are detected in both strains. Interestingly, the C57BL/6J strain had a twice decreased level of the acidic isoform of CC16 compared to C3H/HeJ. Our results suggest that AOP2 and CC16 might participate in the protection of the pulmonary tract to O(3)-induced lung injury.

No significant differences in growth for black cherry were found although there was a 12% reduction in radial growth over 5 yrs (1990u1994) (p-level 0.4) and 8% over 10 yrs (1985u1994) (p-level 0.6). There was a significant difference in radial growth for yellow-poplar of 43% over 5 yrs (p-level 0.001) and 30% over 10 yrs (p-level 0.005). Even though the trees of both species were selected to balance the diameter distribution of each species between the two groups at each site, it was still possible that the differences were due to some other factors than sensitivity to ozone exposure. Therefore, a series of multiple linear regressions were used to identify the most explanatory model based on principal components derived from the following independent variables: Diameter at breast height, total height, height to the live crown, percent slope, and a number of competition indices based on the diameter and distance to competitors. These regressions were then tested for different intercepts and slopes between the sensitive and nonsensitive trees. Once again, no significant differences occurred for black cherry (p-levels of 0.4 and 0.7 for five-year and ten-year radial growth, respectively) and some differences for yellow-poplar (p-levels of 0.04 and 0.1 for five-year and ten-year radial growth, respectively).

The USDA Forest Service administers a long-term, nationwide ozone biomonitoring program to address public and scientific concerns about ozone impacts on forest health. A systematic grid is used as the basis for biomonitoring site locations. At each site, trained field crews evaluate a maximum of thirty plants of up to six species and record the amount and severity of leaf-injury on individual plants. Injury from ozone was found more often on biomonitoring sites in the eastern Unites States than in the interior or west-coast areas. Further results from the northeast reveal that in any year, there is a higher percentage of ozone-injured plants with more severe symptoms in areas with relatively high ozone concentrations than in areas with relatively low ozone. In very dry years (e.g., 1999) the percentage of injured plants and injury severity estimates are both sharply reduced even though ambient ozone exposures are high. These findings demonstrate that biomonitoring data provide meaningful evidence of when high ozone concentrations during the growing season have biological significance.

Methods: Outcome data on 4,407,535 emergency department visits were compiled from 31 hospitals in Atlanta.

We examined collagen deposition in lung tissue from these animals to determine whether or not chronic exposure of rats to ozone causes pulmonary fibrosis, as defined biochemically. Several techniques were used to study collagen deposition in the lungs of the animals. These methods included biochemical quantification by analysis of 4-hydroxyproline in lung tissue hydrolysates. The hydroxylysine-derived cross-links in mature collagen were quantified to estimate biochemically the excess of fibrotic collagen in the lung tissue. Biochemical analysis indicated excess collagen in the female rats exposed to 0.5 or 1.0 ppm ozone. Collagen in the lungs of the females also contained relatively more hydroxylysine-derived cross-links than did the lung collagen from age-matched control animals that had breathed only filtered air. Exposure of Fischer-344 rats for 20 months to 0.5 or 1.0 ppm ozone was associated with excess fibrotic lung collagen deposition as defined histologically. In female rats, exposure was also associated with excess deposition as determined biochemically. There was no indication of any significant changes in the lungs of any of the rats exposed to 0.12 ppm ozone, but the number of animals in this group was far too small to conclude whether this was a true no-observable-effect level. We conclude that chronic exposure of rats for 20 months to ozone at concentrations of 0.5 ppm or above for six hours per day, five days per week, causes mild to moderate lung fibrosis, as defined histologically and, in female rats, biochemically.

Changes in cell volume, cell surface ratios, and cellular characteristics were studied in the terminal bronchioles and in the proximal alveolar regions of the lungs. Animals exposed for 20 months to 0.5 or 1.0 ppm ozone demonstrated dramatic increases in the volume of interstitium and epithelium along the alveolar ducts. The thickening of the epithelium was caused by an epithelial metaplasia in which the normal squamous epithelium was modified to a cuboidal epithelium similar, but not identical, to the type found in terminal bronchioles. This bronchiolar epithelial metaplasia was directly related to dose of ozone, and was characterized by differentiated ciliated cells and Clara cells similar to those found in terminal bronchioles; undifferentiated cuboidal cells also were found in the animals exposed to 0.5 and 1.0 ppm ozone. A mild fibrotic response was seen in the animals exposed to 1.0 ppm ozone, with increases in both the interstitial matrix and cellular interstitium. The individual components of the interstitial matrix, including collagen, elastin, basement membrane, and acellular spaces, all were increased. The increase in cellular interstitium was due to an increase in the volume of interstitial fibroblasts. A slight inflammatory response, identified by an increase in alveolar macrophages, was observed in the animals exposed to 1.0 ppm. The terminal bronchioles were less affected than the proximal alveolar region by the ozone exposures, which may indicate a resistance of this tissue to ozone damage. The changes in the terminal bronchioles mainly consisted of a shift in cell type from ciliated to Clara cells in the animals exposed to 1.0 ppm ozone.

Population-based, cross-sectional studies of metropolitan areas in the United States have also found associations between particulate air pollution and annual mortality rates, but these studies have been criticized, in part because they did not directly control for cigarette smoking and other health risks.

Methods: In this prospective cohort study, we estimated the effects of air pollution on mortality, while controlling for individual risk factors. Survival analysis, including Cox proportional-hazards regression modeling, was conducted with data from a 14-to-16-year mortality follow-up of 8111 adults in six U.S. cities.

Results: Mortality rates were most strongly associated with cigarette smoking. After adjusting for smoking and other risk factors, we observed statistically significant and robust associations between air pollution and mortality. The adjusted mortality-rate ratio for the most polluted of the cities as compared with the least polluted was 1.26 (95 percent confidence interval, 1.08 to 1.47). Air pollution was positively associated with death from lung cancer and cardiopulmonary disease but not with death from other causes considered together. Mortality was most strongly associated with air pollution with fine particulates, including sulfates.

Conclusions: Although the effects of other, unmeasured risk factors cannot be excluded with certainty, these results suggest that fine-particulate air pollution, or a more complex pollution mixture associated with fine particulate matter, contributes to excess mortality in certain U.S. cities.",7.6.1,Introduction,0,0

Upon arising and before retiring, each child recorded the time, three PEFR measurements, and the presence of cold, cough, or wheeze symptoms. Ambient air pollution, including particle-strong acidity, was measured separately during the day (8 a.m. to 8 p.m.) and at night. Each child's maximum PEFR for each session was expressed as the deviation from his or her mean PEFR over the study and adjusted to a standard of 300 liters/minute. The session-specific average deviation was then calculated across all of the children. A second-order autoregressive model for PEFR was developed, which included a separate intercept for evening measurements, trend, temperature, and 12-hour average air pollutant concentration weighted by the number of hours each child spent outdoors during the previous 12-hour period. The results are expressed in terms of the interquartile range for each pollutant. A 12-hour exposure to a 125-nmol/m-3 increment in particle-strong acidity was associated with a -2.5 liters/minute deviation in the group mean PEFR (95% confidence interval (CI) -4.2 to -0.8) and with increased cough incidence (odds ratio (OR) = 1.6, 95% CI 1.1 to 2.4).

The children who had wheezing before three years of age but not at the age of six had diminished airway function (length-adjusted maximal expiratory flow at functional residual capacity [Vsub maxFRC]) both before the age of one year and at the age of six years, were more likely than the other children to have mothers who smoked but not mothers with asthma, and did not have elevated serum IgE levels or skin-test reactivity. Children who started wheezing in early life and continued to wheeze at the age of six were more likely than the children who never wheezed to have mothers with a history of asthma (P<0.001), to have elevated serum IgE levels (P<0.01) and normal lung function in the first year of life, and to have elevated serum IgE levels (P<0.001) and diminished values for VmaxFRC (P<0.01) at six years of age. 

Conclusions: The majority of infants with wheezing have transient conditions associated with diminished airway function at birth and do not have increased risks of asthma or allergies later in life. In a substantial minority of infants, however, wheezing episodes are probably related to a predisposition to asthma.",7.2.1.2,Prevalence of Asthma and Asthma Symptoms,0,0

For these children, small pulmonary function decrements associated with ambient ozone concentrations were reported previously. In this paper, the association between photochemical ambient air pollution and acute respiratory symptoms is evaluated. Occurrence of acute respiratory symptoms was registered by the parents of the children in a diary on a daily basis. The association of symptom prevalence and incidence with air pollution was evaluated using a logistic regression model that took auto-correlation of the residuals into account. Several photochemical episodes occurred in the study period of 102 d. Hourly maximum ozone concentrations ranged from 14 to 114 ppb.

Objective: The hypothesis was that air pollutants exacerbate allergic symptoms of the nose and eyes during the pollen season. In addition, the use of allergen measurements instead of pollen counts should be tested. 
 Methods: Fifteen pollen-allergic, nonsmoking subjects with weak reactivity of the airways recorded rhinoconjunctival symptoms and medication every morning and evening throughout the pollen season. Symptoms were compared with air pollutants (nitrogen oxide [NOx], particulate matter smaller than 10  m, and ozone) and birch and grass pollen counts or, alternatively, to airborne birch and grass allergens determined using ELISA-techniques. A multiple linear regression model was used which controlled for autocorrelation of the residuals of the time series (Cochrane-Orcutt approach). This model was applied to each subject individually, followed by calculations of summary scores for the group. 
 Results: Air pollution levels were moderate, often meeting air quality standards. Effect estimates (increase of score with 10-fold increase of concentration) were NOx = 1.06, P <0.01; ozone = 1.59, P < 0.01; and pollen = 0.48, P <0.001.Using allergen concentrations instead of pollen counts resulted in similar effect estimates. Using particulate matter smaller than 10  m instead of NOx gave comparable but less consistent results. 
 Conclusions: Symptoms were related to moderate levels of pollutants, suggesting that rhinoconjunctival tissue is very sensitive to irritant stimuli during an ongoing allergic inflammation, and that susceptibility toward allergens might be increased in areas with increased levels of air pollutants. Allergen measurements seem equally usable as pollen counts to investigate rhinoconjunctivitis.",6.2.6,Allergic and Asthma-Related Responses,0,0

The relationship between BP and air quality is considered by reviewing the literature, by deleting variables from the proportional hazards regression model, and by stratifying the cohort by diastolic blood pressure (DBP) level. The literature review shows BP to be an important predictor of survival and finds small transient associations between air quality and BP that may be either positive or negative. The regression model sensitivity runs showed that the associations with air pollution are robust to the deletion of the BP variables, for the entire cohort. For stratified regressions, the confidence intervals for the air pollution-mortality associations overlap for the two DBP groups.

Recent studies have indicated that the combination of ozone and nitrogen may alter biomass allocation in pines towards that of deciduous trees, accelerate litter accumulation, and increase carbon sequestration rates in heavily polluted forests. Further study of the effects of multiple pollutants, and their long-term consequences on the mixed conifer ecosystem, cannot be adequately done using the original San Bernardino Mountains Air Pollution Gradient network.

* Ozone did not affect the sink strength of fruits, but there was a trend to decreasing relative specific uptake of fruits when leaf 1, but not when leaf 3, was labelled. Ozone increased the sink strength of leaf blades younger than the source leaf when leaf 3 was labelled. Leaf 3, but not leaf 1, distributed assimilates mostly to the fruit.

Resource (carbon, water, nutrients) acquisition, allocation, and partitioning are affected by exposure to oxidant pollution. In this chapter, resource acquisition refers to plant processes that gain carbon, nutrients, or water. Allocation is the redistribution of a resource to another plant part separated spatially from point of acquisition to its use (Dickson 1989). Resource partitioning is the chemical repackaging of carbon, nutrients, or water for metabolism, detoxification, reparation, or respiratory functions and may include compounds that are produced and stored until use within a plant part. The total pool of resources obtained, the cost of tissue maintenance, and the total pool of resources retained with environmental stressors ultimately determines the perceived stress and fate of the individual.",9.2.5,Ambient Gradients,8.1.2.1.4,Ambient Gradients

In both clones, ozone stress led to significantly reduced leaf- level net photosynthesis but significantly increased stomatal conductance rates during the late summer, resulting in a lower carbon gain for bud formation and the onset of visi- ble foliar injuries.

Because populations have been shown to differ in ozone resistance, the aim of the experiment was to compare the reaction of populations from contrasting ozone climates to different types of ozone exposure. Three populations were grown under controlled conditions in five different ozone treatments (including controls for 10 wk. Development, growth, stomatal conductance and seed production were recorded. Populations were from the south coast of England (Lullington), near a mountain summit (Great Dun Fell) and lowland Scotland (Bush). Ozone treatments were: charcoal and Purafil filtered sir (CF); 35 nIl-1 for 24 h every day; 70 nil-' h for 7 h every day; CF then three episodes each week of 70 nIl~' for 7 h; and 35 nIl~' continuously plus three 7 h episodes each week of 70 nI 1'. The different ozone treatments resulted in different responses in each population. Ozone promoted senescence in the Great Dun Fell population but not in the others; it reduced root growth more in the Lullington population than in the others but those from Lullington and Great Dun Fell maintained seed production to a much greater extent than the Bush population. The reproductive effort (number of seeds g' of vegetative weight> actually increased in ozone in the Lullington and Great Dun Fell populations. It is suggested that this might be a general stress response rather than being specifically related to ozone. Effects on stomatal conductance were similar to those previously reported and the converse of effects on seed production. The relative responses of the populations varied according to the ozone treatment. Continuous exposure to 35 nl V' reduced leaf size only in the Great Dun Fell population, but seed output was reduced in the Bush population. In some cases, giving 3-d episodes of 70 nIl-' had a greater effect than giving the dose every day but the effects varied with the population. This greater effect was considered to be a result of the time it takes for a plant to develop maximum anti-oxidant defence, which is lost when the ozone decreases after the episode. A plant exposed to episodes might have to re-induce defence with each exposure. Although it is reported frequently that ozone favours allocation of resources to the shoot over the root, it is concluded that this is an over-simplification of the response. Even within a species there is a complex suite of responses that varies with the population and with ozone exposure. Describing a population as resistant or sensitive is also an over-simplification.",9.4.3.3,Reproduction,0,0

Establishing the vulnerability of vegetation to rising background ozone is complicated by marked differences in findings between individual studies. Ozone effects are influenced by exposure dynamics, nutrient and moisture conditions, and the species and cultivars that are investigated. Meta-analytic techniques provide an objective means to quantitatively summarize treatment responses. Soybean has been the subject of many studies of ozone effects. It is both the most widely planted dicotyledonous crop and a model for other C3 annual plants. Meta-analytic techniques were used to quantitatively summarize the response of soybean to an average, chronic ozone exposure of 70 p.p.b., from 53 peer-reviewed studies. At maturity, the average shoot biomass was decreased 34% and seed yield was 24% lower. Even in studies where [O3] was < 60 p.p.b., there was a significant decrease in biomass and seed production. At low [O3], decreased production corresponded to a decrease in leaf photosynthesis, but in higher [O3] the larger loss in production was associated with decreases in both leaf photosynthesis and leaf area. The impact of ozone increased with developmental stage, with little effect on vegetative growth and the greatest effect evident at completion of seed filling.

The air exclusion system was shown to be an effective alternative to open-top field chambers for controlled exposures of air pollutants to low growing plants. The system design included particulate and activated charcoal filters, pressure-type blowers, a mixing manifold, and perforated inflatable ducts that were positioned between rows of plants. Tests with CO as a tracer gas indicated optimal system parameters for air exclusion including: air flow of at least 0.944 m3 s-1 within the ducts, three or four rows of holes on the side of each duct pointing 45? upward, 90? to the side, and 45? downward from the center of the duct, four ducts per system, and a hole size that provided an air velocity of 0.5 to 1.8 m s-1 over the plant canopy. Reductions of  >70% in ambient O3 concentrations could be achieved over the plant canopy at 0.25m above the ground with the air exclusion system under optimum conditions (low ambient wind speed and high ambient ozone concentrations). This was comparable to the reductions achieved with either open-top or closed-top chambers.

The terracosm performance data indicate that between 92 and 100% of the hourly CO2 concentrations are within ?50 Amol mol-1 of the target concentrations for both ambient and elevated treatments (1 Nov. 1993 through 30 Nov. 1994). Air temperatures are within 2?C of the target temperature between 85 and 100% of the hours for both ambient and elevated temperature treatments. The VPD was approximately the same (0.09 kPa difference between treatments) in the ambient and elevated temperature treatments. Distributed process control was implemented to minimize downtime.

In this heterogeneous environment, individuals close to each other will experience variable degrees of root restriction. As some populations of P. major have been demonstrated to be sensitive to ozone, the aim of this study was to investigate the effect of root restriction on the response of P. major to ozone.

It was hypothesized that root restriction should reduce the effects of ozone. If this is true it would have implications for evolution of ozone resistance. A single population of P. major was grown in controlled?environment chambers and exposed to either charcoal/Purafil?filtered air or to ozone (70 nl O3 l?1for 7 h d?1).

At the final harvest, the total nitrogen content of leaf tissue was analysed and compared with that of plants collected from the field.

Plants grown in the smallest pots exhibited severely impaired growth, lower gs and lower A than non?restricted plants. Root growth was less impaired than shoot growth. However, only plants in the smallest pots resembled those found in the field, which implies that realistic assessment of ozone effects on this species should involve a degree of root restriction. Appearance and leaf nitrogen content of leaves suggested that root restriction may have caused nitrogen deficiency.

Canopy development in OTCs supplied with non-filtered air (NF) and in ambient (AA) plots was followed by measuring leaf area index (LAI). The dry matter yield was determined after three growth periods in each of two consecutive seasons. Boundary layer conductance (gbw) and wind speed (u) were measured along a vertical profile, and day-time flux were measured along a vertical profile, and day-time flux of O3 was estimated throughout the experiment on the basis of a mass balance. The vertical profile of u showed values in the range 1-1 2 m s-1 at the top of the canopy, and maximum gbw was 20-25 mm s-1. Average reduction in global radiation in OTCs was 25%, and volumetric soil water content was reduced by about 5%. Daily mean Tair was increased by 1 3 C, mean daily maximum svpd by 0 08 kPa, and the temperature sum (degree days with base temperature of +5 C) by 12%. Fluctuations in the difference in daily mean Tair and svpd during the daytime between OTCs and ambient air were related to canopy structure. Differences were largest after each cut and declined with increasing LAI. A small effect of changes in LAI on Tair and svpd occurred during periods with low soil water content. The flux of O3 in OTCs was largest (>100 Ag m-2 min-1) before and smallest (<20 Ag m-2 min-1) after each cut. Calculated deposition veloties for O3 (vd) in the range 0-3 cm s-1 were generally higher than those measured under most field conditions. Overall, in OTCs the deficit in soil and atmospheric moisture was larger than in the open field, and the increase in daily mean Tair was strongly influenced by the stage of canopy development. Changes in microclimate and incoming radiation affected pasture development. LAI was slightly reduced in OTCs as compared to AA plots. The total accumulated dry matter yield for all six growth periods was only about 7% lower in OTCs, but the contribution of clover to total forage mass declined during the experiment. OTCs had no significant effect on weeds. The results indicate that OTCs reduced the competitiveness of clover, and that the increase in growth of grasses compensates for the loss in clover yield.

The system operates by releasing ozone-enriched air from either one of two 120  sectors, placed in each of the two main wind directions. Ozone-enriched air is rapidly mixed with ambient air behind a small transparent windscreen mounted at canopy height around the 7-m diameter circular plots. Ozone generation and dispensing during daylight hours is PC controlled and depends upon wind speed, wind direction and ambient ozone. In 2001, from April to October fumigation was possible during 85% of the time. The ozone-enrichment factor (EF, [O3]enriched/[O3]control) in ozone plots relative to control plots averaged 1.48 (?0.24 SD), and EF was highest with winds of around 2 m s-1. The seasonal cumulative ozone exposure (AOT40) at canopy level was 5 ppm h in the control and 30 ppm h in the ozone-treated plots, with less than 10% variation between replicates, and 13 ppm h in ambient air at 2 m. Variation in ozone across the plot-diameter was <5% for 24-h mean concentrations, but differed by a maximum of 20% in terms of AOT40. There was no difference in microclimatic conditions between experimental plots and ambient conditions. It is concluded that the system is suitable for long-term ozone experiments at relatively low running costs, but that the variation in ozone distribution across the plots may lead to systematic differences in cumulative exposure over longer periods of time which need to be taken into account when relating exposure to biological effects.",9.2.4,Plume and FACE-Type Systems,8.1.2.1.3,Free Air Carbon Dioxide/Ozone Enrichment (FACE) and Plume Type Systems

RESULTS: Birth weight was shown to be associated with length of gestation, maternal age and instruction, infant gender, number of antenatal care visits, parity, and type of delivery. On adjusting for these variables negative effects of exposure to PM(10) and carbon monoxide during the first trimester were observed. This effect seemed to be more robust for carbon monoxide. For a 1 ppm increase in mean exposure to carbon monoxide during the first trimester a reduction of 23 g in birth weight was estimated.

The authors also found a strong association of the temperature-mortality relation with latitude, with a greater effect of colder temperatures on mortality risk in more-southern cities and of warmer temperatures in more-northern cities. The percentage of households with air conditioners in the south and heaters in the north, which serve as indicators of socioeconomic status of the city population, also predicted weather-related mortality. The model developed in this analysis is potentially useful for projecting the consequences of climate-change scenarios and offering insights into susceptibility to the adverse effects of weather.",6.6.2.2,Effect Modification,0,0

More refined assessment has been limited by study size and available air quality data.

Methods: Measurements of 5 pollutants (particulate matter [PM10], ozone, nitrogen dioxide [NO2], carbon monoxide [CO], and sulfur dioxide [SO2]) were available for the entire study period (1 January 1993 to 31 August 2000); detailed measurements of particulate matter were available for 25 months. We obtained data on 4 million emergency department visits from 31 hospitals in Atlanta. Visits for asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, upper respiratory infection, and pneumonia were assessed in relation to air pollutants using Poisson generalized estimating equations.

Results: In single-pollutant models examining 3-day moving averages of pollutants (lags 0, 1, and 2): standard deviation increases of ozone, NO2, CO, and PM10 were associated with 1?3% increases in URI visits; a 2 ?g/m3 increase of PM2.5 organic carbon was associated with a 3% increase in pneumonia visits; and standard deviation increases of NO2 and CO were associated with 2?3% increases in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease visits. Positive associations persisted beyond 3 days for several of the outcomes, and over a week for asthma.

However, whether ethylene acts alone or in conjunction with other signaling pathways is not clearly understood. Ethylene overproducer mutants, eto1 and eto3, produced high levels of ethylene and developed necrotic lesions in response to an acute O3 exposure that does not induce lesions in O3-tolerant wild-type Col-0 plants. Treatment of plants with ethylene inhibitors completely blocked O3- induced ethylene production and partially attenuated O3-induced cell death. Analyses of the responses of molecular markers of specific signaling pathways indicated a relationship between salicylic acid (SA)- and ethylene-signaling pathways and O3 sensitivity. Both eto1 and eto3 plants constitutively accumulated threefold higher levels of total SA and exhibited a rapid increase in free SA and ethylene levels prior to lesion formation in response to O3 exposure. SA pre-treatments increased O3 sensitivity of Col-0, suggesting that constitutive high SA levels prime leaf tissue to exhibit increased magnitude of O3-induced cell death. NahG and npr1 plants compromised in SA signaling failed to produce ethylene in response to O3 and other stress factors suggesting that SA is required for stress-induced ethylene production. Furthermore, NahG expression in the dominant eto3 mutant attenuated ethylene-dependent PR4 expression and rescued the O3-induced HR (hypersensitive response) cell death phenotype exhibited by eto3 plants.

Three different exposure indices were compared: AOT40 (accumulated exposure over a threshold ozone concentration of 40 nmol mol-1), CUOt (cumulative stomatal uptake of ozone, using a constant ozone uptake rate threshold of t nmol m-2 s-1) and mAOTc0 (conductance modified AOT using a threshold concentration for ozone of c0 nmol mol-1). The latter is essentially a combination of AOT and CUO. Ozone uptake was estimated using a Jarvis-type multiplicative model for stomatal conductance. In terms of correlation between relative yield (RY) and ozone exposure, CUO5, the CUO index with an ozone uptake rate threshold of 5 nmol m-2 s-1, performed best for both wheat and potato, resulting in r2 values of 0.77 and 0.64, respectively. CUO5 performed considerably better in terms of the correlation between RY and ozone exposure, than AOT40 for wheat, while mAOT10, the best performing mAOT index in this case, was intermediate in performance for this crop. For potato, the differences between the different ozone exposure indices AOT40, CUO5 and mAOT20 (the mAOT index performing best for potato) in the correlation between RY and ozone exposure were relatively small. To test the assumption that the non-stomatal deposition of ozone was negligible for the uppermost, sunlit leaves, measurements of ozone uptake in relation to leaf conductance for water vapor of wheat leaves in a cuvette system were used. The non-stomatal deposition of ozone to the leaves turned out to be comparatively small. Based on the non-stomatal conductance (gns=15 mmol m-2 s-1) estimated for the wheat leaves in the cuvette system, it was concluded that the consequence of omitting the non-stomatal conductance is small. In conclusion the study indicated that the ozone uptake based approach showed a high degree of fitting along a north-south European transect of pedoclimatic conditions, and represents a better and more relevant approach to the quantification of ozone effects on crops growth than the use of ozone exposure indices purely based on ozone concentrations.

Doseuresponse relationships based on cumulative leaf uptake of ozone (CUO) were calculated using different hourly ozone flux thresholds and these were compared to doseuresponse relationships based on daylight AOT40, which is currently used within the UNECE Convention on Long-Range Transboundary Air Pollution (CLRTAP). Regression analysis showed that the CUOubiomass response relationships were highly significant for both coniferous and broadleaf trees, and independent of which ozone flux threshold was applied. On the basis of this regressions analysis, an hourly flux threshold of 1.6 nmol m-2 s-1 (CUO>1.6) is proposed as the most appropriate for all species categories in deriving doseuresponse relationships. The analysis indicated that the current critical level for ozone impacts on European forests of AOT40 10 ppm h may not protect the most sensitive receptors and that critical levels for AOT40 and CUO>1.6 of 5 ppm h and 4 mmol m-2, respectively, are more appropriate.

Objectives: Generally, studies use Poisson regression, with complicated modeling strategies, to control for season and weather, raising concerns that the results may be sensitive to these modeling protocols. For studies of ozone, weather control is a particular problem because high ozone days are generally quite hot. 
Methods: The case-crossover approach converts this problem into a case-control study, where the control for each person is the same person on a day near in time, when he or she did not die. This method controls for season and individual risk factors by matching. One can also choose the control day to have the same temperature as the event day. 
Measurements: I have applied this approach to a study of over one million deaths in 14 US cities. 
Main Results: I found that, with matching on temperature, a 10 ppb increase in maximum hourly ozone concentrations was associated with a 0.23% (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.01%, 0.44%) increase in the risk of dying. This finding was indistinguishable from the risk when only matching on season and controlling for temperature with regression splines (0.19%; 95% CI 03%, 0.35%). Control for suspended particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter of 10Am or less (PM10) did not change this risk. However, the association was restricted to the warm months (0.37% increase; 95% CI 0.11%, 0.62%), with no effect in the cold months.

Measurements of gas exchange (assimilation versus light and assimilation versus intercellular [CO(2)]) were made on excised leaves from control and treatment plots (n = 4). In contrast to expectations from previous chamber studies, elevated [O(3)] did not alter light-saturated photosynthesis (A(sat), P = 0.09), carboxylation capacity (V(c,max), P = 0.82), or maximum electron transport (J(max), P = 0.66) for the topmost most recently fully expanded leaf at any stage of crop development. Leaves formed during the vegetative growth stage did not show a significant ozone-induced loss of photosynthetic capacity as they aged.

METHODS AND RESULTS: Pollutant concentrations (SO2, NO2, and O3) were measured hourly as part of the automated air quality network. Since 1985, an AMI registry (the Toulouse MONICA Project) has been collecting data in the southwest of France.

We performed a conditional logistic regression analysis to calculate relative risks (RRs) and their 95% CIs.

METHODS: The number of daily cardiac hospital admissions was obtained from all Windsor hospitals from April 1, 1995 to December 31, 2000 and linked to concentrations of ambient air pollutants and weather variables. The logarithm of daily counts of hospitalization was regressed on the levels of pollutants, after adjusting for seasonal, weekly cycles, and weather variables using time series analysis with natural splines as smoothing functions. RESULTS: Of all the pollutants considered, sulphur dioxide (SO2) had the strongest effect on cardiac hospitalization among the > or = 65 age group. The percentage increase in daily admission was 2.6% for current day sulphur dioxide level (95% CI: 0.5-6.4), 4.0% for 2-day mean level (95% CI: 0.1-6.9), and 5.6% (95% CI: 1.5-9.9) for 3-day mean level for an increase in interquartile range of 19.3 ppb.

In the meta-analysis, a 10-ppb increase in daily ozone at single-day or 2-day average of lags 0, 1, or 2 days was associated with an 0.87% increase in total mortality (95% posterior interval = 0.55% to 1.18%), whereas the lag 0 NMMAPS estimate is 0.25% (0.12% to 0.39%). Several findings indicate possible publication bias: meta-analysis results were consistently larger than those from NMMAPS; meta-analysis pooled estimates at lags 0 or 1 were larger when only a single lag was reported than when estimates for multiple lags were reported; and heterogeneity of city-specific estimates in the meta-analysis were larger than with NMMAPS.

Methods: We conducted a review and meta-analysis of short-term ozone mortality studies, identified unresolved issues, and conducted an additional time-series analysis for 7 U.S. cities (Chicago, Detroit, Houston, Minneapolis-St. Paul, New York City, Philadelphia, and St. Louis). Results: Our review found a combined estimate of 0.39% (95% confidence interval = 0.26-0.51%) per 10-ppb increase in 1-hour daily maximum ozone for the all-age nonaccidental cause/single pollutant model (43 studies). Adjusting for the funnel plot asymmetry resulted in a slightly reduced estimate (0.35%; 0.23- 0.47%). In a subset for which particulate matter (PM) data were available (15 studies), the corresponding estimates were 0.40% (0.27-0.53%) for ozone alone and 0.37% (0.20-0.54%) with PM in model. The estimates for warm seasons were generally larger than those for cold seasons. Our additional time-series analysis found that including PM in the model did not substantially reduce the ozone risk estimates. However, the difference in the weather adjustment model could result in a 2-fold difference in risk estimates (eg, 0.24% to 0.49% in multicity combined estimates across alternative weather models for the ozone-only all-year case).

We conducted an empiric Bayes metaregression to estimate the ozone effect on mortality, and to assess whether this effect varies as a function of hypothesized confounders or effect modifiers. METHODS: We gathered 71 time-series studies relating ozone to all-cause mortality, and we selected 48 estimates from 28 studies for the metaregression. Metaregression covariates included the relationship between ozone concentrations and concentrations of other air pollutants, proxies for personal exposure-ambient concentration relationships, and the statistical methods used in the studies. For our metaregression, we applied a hierarchical linear model with known level-1 variances. RESULTS: We estimated a grand mean of a 0.21% increase (95% confidence interval = 0.16-0.26%) in mortality per 10-microg/m increase of 1-hour maximum ozone (0.41% increase per 10 ppb) without controlling for other air pollutants. In the metaregression, air-conditioning prevalence and lag time were the strongest predictors of between-study variability. Air pollution covariates yielded inconsistent findings in regression models, although correlation analyses indicated a potential influence of summertime PM2.5. CONCLUSIONS: These findings, coupled with a greater relative risk of ozone in the summer versus the winter, demonstrate that geographic and seasonal heterogeneity in ozone relative risk should be anticipated, but that the observed relationship between ozone and mortality should be considered for future regulatory impact analyses.",6.6.2,Associations of Mortality and Short-Term O3 Exposure ,6.1.3,Total (Nonaccidental) Mortality

In particular, no data are available concerning the behavioral development of mouse offspring after maternal exposure, despite the fact that increasing use is made of this species in behavioral teratology studies for reasons both of economy and in order to increase the effectiveness of subsequent higher-tier studies (e.g., of treatment-genotype interactions). In the present work, female CD-1 mice were exposed during pregnancy (Days 7-17) to different O3 concentrations (0, 0.4, 0.8, or 1.2 ppm); to avoid confounding by postnatal maternal effects, all litters were assigned shortly after birth to foster dams neither treated nor handled during pregnancy. The dams' food and water intake and body weight gain were depressed in a concentration-dependent fashion. Tolerance to these effects developed during continuing exposure; such tolerance was faster in the case of food than water intake. Several measures of reproductive performance, such as proportion of pregnancies carried to term, litter size, sex ratio, frequency of stillbirth, and neonatal mortality, failed to show differences between control and O3 animals. Postnatal body weight gain was slightly but significantly depressed in the 1.2 ppm offspring. Otherwise, the somatic development of O3 pups was indistinguishable from that of controls, save for a delay in eye opening; this effect, however, failed to show a significant concentration dependence. Negative results were obtained in a wide range of assessments concerning (i) the development of various reflexes and responses (""Fox battery"") from birth to Day 18; (ii) ultrasonic emissions on Postnatal Days 3, 7, and 11; and (iii) activity, habituation, response to an unfamiliar object, and hyperactivity produced by a monoaminergic stimulant (d-amphetamine) at 60-61 days. The present data differ from those of a previous study on rats raised by their biological mothers after gestational exposure to O3 (1 and 1.5 ppm), which showed a substantial impairment in somatic and neurobehavioral development (R. Kavlock, E. Meyer, and C. T. Grabowski, 1980, Toxicol. Lett. 5, 3-9). This difference, be it due to species factors, to postnatal maternal effects, or to the time of occurrence of maximal O3 effects (e.g., on food and water intake) after the onset of exposure and before adaptation or tolerance, may provide significant cues for the understanding of O3 effects in pregnant and developing organisms.",7.4.2,Effects on Reproduction,7.1.2.3.2,Toxicological Evidence of Effects on Female Reproduction

In the present studies we analyzed the effects of brief exposure of rats to inhaled ozone on production of this mediator by lung macrophages and type II epithelial cells. We found that ozone exposure (1-2 ppm, 3 hr) induced a marked increase in spontaneous nitric oxide production by alveolar (AM) and interstitial macrophages, as well as type II cells. These effects were apparently due to increased expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase protein and mRNA, which was evident in vitro in isolated cells and in situ in histologic sections. Macrophages and epithelial cells from ozone-treated rats were also sensitized to produce increased amounts of nitric oxide in response to inflammatory cytokines such as interferon-gamma, a response that was also mediated by inducible nitric oxide synthase. Unexpectedly, we also discovered that brief inhalation of ozone caused dramatic effects on the liver, including increased production of nitric oxide by hepatocytes and enhanced protein synthesis. These data suggest that this inhaled irritant induces an acute phase response. Additional studies indicate that AM from ozone-treated rats produced significantly more tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interleukin-1 than did cells from control animals. Elevated levels of tumor necrosis factor-alpha were also noted immunohistochemically in both lung and liver tissue. These results indicate that the extrapulmonary effects of ozone may be mediated by inflammatory cytokines released by activated lung macrophages.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",6.5.1,Effects on the Liver and Xenobiotic Metabolism,0,0

Male and female Fischer 344 rats were exposed and morphometric methods were used to determine the volume, surface area, and cellular changes observed in bronchiole-alveolar duct regions following chronic ozone exposure. No major gender-related effects were observed in response to chronic inhalation of ozone nor were significant effects of ozone exposure found in either terminal bronchioles or the proximal alveolar regions in animals chronically exposed to 0.12 ppm ozone. The proximal alveolar regions of animals exposed for 20 months to 0.5 and 1.0 ppm ozone were significantly altered with exposure. The high-dose, long-term exposure to ozone resulted in a pronounced increase in volume of both the interstitium and epithelium in the proximal alveolar regions. The thickening of the epithelium was due to a change in tissue type from the normal squamous epithelium to a cuboidal epithelium similar, but not identical, to that found in terminal bronchioles. This bronchiolar epithelial metaplasia of proximal alveolar ducts, which was dose related, was composed of differentiated ciliated and Clara cells similar to those found in terminal bronchioles. In addition, unique cells which contained morphologic features of many different cell types were observed. These cells, which may represent stem cells or differentiated but transformed cells, were found associated with the bronchiolar metaplasia of alveolar ducts. In conjunction with the epithelial changes, cellular and matrix components in the interstitium were increased with chronic exposure to 0.5 and 1.0 ppm ozone. All matrix components were increased including collagen, elastin, and basement membrane, as well as other acellular spaces which did not contain identifiable structures. The total volume of interstitial fibroblasts was also increased in the high-dose exposure group. Alveolar macrophages were increased only in the 1.0 ppm exposed animals. The cell and tissue changes in the terminal bronchioles were less pronounced indicating a relative resistance of this tissue to ozone and mainly consisted of a change in cell type from ciliated to Clara cells in the 1.0 ppm exposed animals. The relative resistance of bronchiolar tissue to high concentration ozone exposure and the extensive bronchiolar epithelial metaplasia seen in the alveolar ducts suggest that bronchiolar metaplasia may be an adaptive mechanism following chronic ozone exposure. The bronchiolar epithelial metaplasia and interstitial fibrosis seen with high-dose chronic ozone exposure are similar to, and may be a model for, the early steps in human fibrotic diseases such as idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.",7.2.3.2,Pulmonary Structure and Function: Evidence from Toxicological Studies and Nonhuman Primate Asthma Models,0,0

In social interaction tests performed in the pre-juvenile period (23-25 days) and the juvenile period (43-45 days), social response endpoints were not modified in O3 mice, but exploration and self-grooming showed concentration dependent effects (decrease and increase, respectively). Performance at 84-98 days in an eight-arm radial maze with water reinforcement was initially impaired in O3 mice, but the results were not entirely consistent; e.g., the data failed to show a concentration dependence of the effects. Overall, the data confirm previous results of an experiment with more limited exposure [pregnancy Days 7-17 (6)] by showing that prenatal O3 exposure, even when extended to include a period before the start of pregnancy and the preimplantation phase, does not produce major or widespread somatic and neurobehavioral effects. Some of the results, however, point to subtle or borderline behavioral deficits which deserve to be considered both in further animal experiments and in the assessment of risk to developing humans.

Selected biomarkers were analyzed in venous blood, cord blood (chromosomal aberrations, comet assay) and placenta (DNA adducts, genetic polymorphisms of GSTM1 and NAT2 genotypes) of women enrolled in a nested case-control study. DNA adduct levels were higher in polluted vs. control districts, in smoking vs. nonsmoking mothers, and in GSTM1 null genotype, which was more pronounced in polluted district. No effect of air pollution was observed by cytogenetic analysis of chromosomal aberrations or by comet assay. The reproductive development of young men was followed by measures of semen quality, adjusted for ambient SO2 exposure. The analysis identified significant associations with air pollution for <13% morphologically normal sperm, <29% sperm with normal head shape, <24% motile sperm. Analysis of aneuploidy in human sperm by FISH showed, aneuploidy YY8 was associated with season of heaviest air pollution. These findings are suggestive for an influence of air pollution on YY8 disomy. All these results indicate that air pollution may increase DNA damage in human population, which may be even higher for susceptible groups. Biomarkers of exposure (DNA adducts) and susceptibility (GSTM1 and NAT2) may indicate the risk of presumable low environmental exposure. Pregnancy outcome and semen studies imply that relatively low air pollution (higher than 40 Ag PM10/m3) can significantly increase the adverse reproductive outcomes affecting both genders.

Two separate sets of seedlings were each exposed to various concentrations of ozone (charcoal-filtered; 0.5 x (not used in 1989), 1.0 x, 1.5 x, and 2.0 x modified ambient) in two different seasons. Seasonal indices of exposure (SUM00, SUM06 and AOT40) for the 1.0 x treatments were 39.2, 1.9, and 1.62 ppm h respectively, in 1989, and 63.1, 0.9, and 0.78 ppm h, respectively, in 1992. No significant chamber effects were noted, except for reduced height growth in open plots compared with 1.0 x chambers in 1992. In both years, the 2.0 x treatment reduced total, leaf, root, and shoot+root biomass, although some of these changes were only marginally significant in 1992. Stem biomass was significantly reduced in 1989, but not 1992. Leaf area, count and weight were all highly correlated, and showed significant reductions in both years. The leaf area ratio (leaf area/total weight) was reduced in 1989, but not in 1992. Height was not affected by ozone, but diameter was reduced only in 1989. Chamber-to-chamber variation for biomass and leaf variates was greater in 1992, and as a result, significance levels were lower. Weibull functions were fitted to chamber means, and showed significant near-linear declines for most components when log-transformed data were plotted against the SUM06 and AOT40 indices. Individual Weibull models for the 1989 and 1992 data sets, and combined models over both years, were developed. Combined models were adequate for describing ozone responses for all biomass components, as determined by the likelihood ratio test. The data show that the two years of exposure produced similar, but not identical effects, despite large differences in initial size of the seedlings and in seasonal ozone dynamics.

In large part, the results of this research supported governmental regulations designed to limit tropospheric O 3 levels to concentrations that affected crop production at economically acceptable levels. Recent studies have brought into question the effi- cacy of these concentration-based O 3 standards compared with flux-based approaches that incorporate O 3 uptake along with environmental and biotic factors that influence plant responses. In addition, recent studies provide insight into the biochemical mechanisms of O 3 injury to plants. Current interpretations suggest that upon entry into the leaf intercellular space O 3 rapidly reacts with components of the leaf apoplast to initiate a complex set of responses involving the formation of toxic metabolites and generation of plant defence responses that constitute variably effective countermeasures. Plant species and cultivars exhibit a range of sensitivity to O 3 , evident as heritable characteristics, that must reflect identifiable biochemical and molecular processes that affect sensitivity to O 3 injury, although their exact makeup remains unclear. Ozone clearly impairs photosynthetic processes, which might include the effects on electron transport and guard cell homeostasis as well as the better-documented effects on carbon fixation via decreased Rubisco activity. Translocation of photosynthate could be inhibited by O 3 exposure as well. Further, the influence of tropospheric O 3 needs to be considered when assessing potential effects of rising concentrations of atmospheric CO 2 on crop production.

Fewer live leaves and decreased photosynthesis in late grain filling appear to drive the ozone-induced losses in production and yield. -These results validate previous chamber studies suggesting that soybean yields will decrease under increasing ozone exposure. In fact, these results suggest that when treated under open-air conditions yield losses may be even greater than the large losses already reported in earlier chamber studies. Yield losses with elevated ozone were greater in the second year following a severe hailstorm, suggesting that losses may due to ozone may be exacerbated by extreme climatic events.",9.2.6,Comparative Studies,8.5.1,Field Studies and Meta Analyses

At all sites, gas exchange was under tight stomatal control during the growing season. Stomatal conductance was strongly correlated with leaf water potential (R-2 = 0.82), which decreased over the growing season with decreasing soil water content (R-2 = 0.60). Ozone uptake, carbon uptake, and transpirational water loss closely followed the dynamics of stomatal conductance. Peak ozone and CO2 uptake occurred in early summer and declined progressively thereafter. As a result, periods of maximum ozone uptake did not correspond to periods of peak ozone concentration, underscoring the inaropriateness of using current metrics based on concentration (e.g., SUM0, W126 and AOT40) for assessing ozone exposure risk to plants in this climate region. Both J(max) (maximum CO2-saturated photosynthetic rate, limited by electron transport) and V-cmax (maximum rate of Rubisco-limited carboxylation) increased toward the middle of the growing season, then decreased in September. Intrinsic water-use efficiency rose with increasing drought stress, as expected. The ratio of J(max) to V-cmax was similar to literature values of 2.0. Nighttime respiration followed a Q(10) of 2.0, but was significantly higher at the high-ozone site.

O3. A substantial proportion of these ESTs had predicted functions in cell rescue/defense processes. Using these

In general, short-term exposure to sulphur dioxide (SO2) promotes stomatal opening, whereas longer-term exposure can cause partial stomatal closure. By contrast, the effects of oxides of nitrogen (NOx) are often small or insignificant. The effects of ozone, and oxidative stress, are equally complex. Short-term exposure to ozone stimulates a rapid reduction in stomatal aperture, whilst longer-term exposure causes stomatal responses to become sluggish. The response of stomata to abscisic acid (ABA) has been shown to be slower in plants exposed to a combination of SO2 and NO2 suggesting an adverse effect on guard cell ABA signal transduction. In addition, ozone causes a reduction in stomatal closure under drought conditions. There is an increasing body of evidence to suggest that air pollutants and oxidative stresses can have a marked effect on the Ca2+ homeostasis of guard cells and the intracellular machinery responsible for stomatal movements. Here we discuss the effects of air pollutants on stomatal responses and their possible effects on Ca2+ based signalling in guard cells focusing on the effects of ozone and oxidative stress.",9.3.2.1,Changes in Stomatal Function,0,0

Accordingly, the EPR signals were generally stronger in the lungs of the senescent rats by comparison to juvenile rats.

This increase was significantly different (p = 0.017, unadjusted for basal BP) from the small 2-hr change during PFA (median change, 1 mm Hg; 95% CI, -2 to 4; p = 0.24). This prompted further investigation of the CAP+O3 response, which showed a strong association between the 2-hr change in DBP (and mean arterial pressure) and the concentration of the organic carbon fraction of PM2.5 (r = 0.53, p < 0.01; r = 0.56, p < 0.01, respectively) but not with total PM2.5 mass (r < or = 0.25, p > or = 0.27).

The rats, chronically implanted with an electrocardiographic  (ECG)  electrodes,  were  placed in a head-out plethysmograph for continuous ventilatory measurements of tidal volume and breathing frequency. Simultaneous measurements of HR were also obtained. A 6-hr exposure of each rat to filtered air was followed 2 days later by a 5-hr exposure to 0.1 ppm O3, 5 days later by a 5-hr exposure to 0.3 ppm O3 and 10 days later by a 5-hr exposure to 0.5 ppm O3. Each of the O3 exposures was preceded by a 1-hr exposure to filtered air. Transient rapid shallow breathing with slightly increased HR appeared 1-2 min after the start  of  O3  exposure.  It  was  suggested on the basis of the electroencephalographic (EEG) activity of the olfactory bulb that this transient response was mediated through olfactory sensation. Persistent rapid shallow breathing with a progressive decrease in HR occurred with a latent period of 1-2 hr. The last 90-min averaged values for relative minute ventilation tended to decrease with the increase in the level of exposure to O3 and these values for young rats were significantly lower than those for old rats. An exposure of young rats to 0.1 ppm O3 for shorter than 5 hr significantly decreased the tidal volume and HR and increased breathing frequency, but no significant changes were observed in old rats. There were no differences between young and old rats in non-observable-adverse-effect-levels (NOAELs) for the O3-induced persistent ventilatory and HR responses, when the NOAELs were determined by exposure to 0.3 and 0.5 ppm O3. The present results, as well as the reported decrease in body temperature and blood pressure, suggested that the age-related changes in patterns and magnitude of the persistent rapid shallow breathing with a progressive decrease in HR are mediated through some age-related defense mechanism acting against O3 inhalation.

Ozone (O3), the major oxidant of photochemical smog, is thought to be genotoxic and a potential respiratory carcinogen or promoter of carcinogenic processes. Because of oxidative reactions with the mucus in the upper airway, O3 reaction product are able to penetrate into the tracheobronchial epithelial (TE) cells. The carcinogenic effects of O3 on the TE cells are especially of interest since most previous studies have focused on the morphology or permeability changes of tracheas only. Therefore, the objective of this study was to examine the potential O3 genotoxicity in TE cells after an in vivo exposure, using DNA strand breaks as an index.

The statistical significance level was set at a .05. Compared with controls, ozone exposure did not alter the TE cell yield or viability, but caused an increase in protein content in tracheal lavage and an increase in DNA strand breaks. The amount of DNA left in the alkali lysate of TE cells found at 72 h exposure was significantly decreased from controls for 3 different alkali incubation times. An increase of the double-stranded DNA left in the alkali lysate of TE cells was observed at 96 h of exposure and approached the value of 24 h of exposure. The same pattern was seen with all 3 different alkali incubation times at 15 degrees C. One Qd unit was estimated to correspond to 100 strand breaks per cell.

METHODS: Long term concurrent trends, temperature, humidity, day of the week, influenza epidemic of 1989, and cyclical covariations with periodicity > 20 days in daily measures of pollution and admissions for 1987-94 were allowed for. 

RESULTS: There were 373556 admissions. No association was found between O3 and circulatory diseases. Four other pollutants were associated with acute myocardial infarction and circulatory diseases combined. P values and attributable cases (95% confidence intervals) for acute myocardial infarction were: black smoke P = 0.003, 2.5% (0.8% to 4.3%); NO2 P = 0.002, 2.7% (0.8% to 4.6%); CO P = 0.001, 2.1% (0.7% to 3.5%); and SO2 P = 0.0006, 1.7% (0.7% to 2.6%). There were also associations between black smoke and angina (P = 0.02), NO2 and arrhythmia (P = 0.04), and CO and other circulatory diseases (P = 0.004), but none with heart failure. Acute myocardial infarction was the only diagnosis for which there were significant associations with and without adjustment for cyclical terms. The associations with acute myocardial infarction were significant only in the cool season. 

CONCLUSION: Population data were consistent with 1 in 50 heart attacks currently presenting at London hospitals being triggered by outdoor air pollution.

METHODS: A time series study was conducted in the City of Edinburgh, which has a population of about 450,000. Poisson log linear regression models were used to investigate the relation of the daily event rate with daily air pollution concentrations of sulphur dioxide (SO2) and black smoke from 1981 to 1995, and of nitrogen dioxide (NO2), ozone (O3), carbon monoxide (CO), and particulate matter (PM10) from 1992 to 1995. Adjustments were made for seasonal and weekday variation, daily temperature, and wind speed.

RESULTS: The most significant findings were positive associations over the period 1981-95 between black smoke as a mean of the previous three days and daily all cause mortality in people aged > or = 65, and respiratory mortality also in this age group (3.9% increase in mortality for a 10 micrograms/m3 increment in black smoke). For hospital emergency admissions between 1992 and 1995 the two most significant findings (p < 0.05) were for cardiovascular admissions of people aged > or = 65 which showed a positive association with PM10 as a mean of the 3 previous days, and a negative association with O3 as a mean of the previous three days. Analyses of outcomes based on linkage with previous cardiorespiratory emergency admissions did not show substantially different results.

CONCLUSION: These data suggest that in the City of Edinburgh, after correction for confounders, there was a small but significant association between concentrations of black smoke and respiratory mortality in the older age group, probably attributable to higher pollution levels in the early part of the study period. There were also generally weak and variable associations between day to day changes in concentrations of urban air pollutants at a single central point and emergency hospital admission rates from cardiac and respiratory disease.",6.3.2.7,Hospital Admissions and Emergency Department Visits,0,0

Our aim was to study the role of neutrophils, and neutrophil-derived serine proteinases in an acute model in patients with asthma. Exposure to ozone induces an acute neutrophilic inflammatory reaction accompanied by an increase in airway hyperresponsiveness. It is thought that these two effects of ozone are linked, and that neutrophil-derived serine proteinases (i.e. elastase) may play a role in the ozone-induced airway hyperresponsiveness. Therefore, we examined the effect of recombinant antileukoprotease (rALP), one of the major serine proteinase inhibitors in the lung, on ozone-induced changes in airway hyperresponsiveness in this model. We observed that 16 h after exposure to ozone, airway hyperresponsiveness to methacholine was increased both following placebo and rALP treatment. There was no significant difference between placebo and rALP treatment (change in area under the dose-response curve to methacholine: 117.3 ? 59.0 vs 193.6 ? 59.6 %fallxDD; p = .12). Moreover, the immediate decrease in FEV1 after ozone exposure was not significantly different between the two groups (placebo: -29.6 ? 6.7%; rALP: -20.9 ? 3.8%; p = .11). In addition, no significant differences were observed in plasma levels of fibrinogen degradation products generated by neutrophil serine proteinases before and after exposure to ozone.

For an increase from the 10th to the 90th percentile in mean PM2.5 level during the 5 days before the visit (10.5 microg/m3), there was a 2.8-mm Hg (95% CI, 0.1 to 5.5) increase in resting systolic, a 2.7-mm Hg (95% CI, 1.2 to 4.3) increase in resting diastolic, and a 2.7-mm Hg (95% CI, 1.0 to 4.5) increase in resting mean arterial blood pressure. The mean PM2.5 level during the 2 preceding days (13.9 microg/m3) was associated with a 7.0-mm Hg (95% CI, 2.3 to 12.1) increase in diastolic and a 4.7-mm Hg (95% CI, 0.5 to 9.1) increase in mean arterial blood pressure during exercise in persons with resting heart rate > or =70 bpm, but it was not associated with an increase in blood pressure during exercise in persons with heart rate <70 bpm. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with preexisting cardiac disease, particle pollution may contribute to increased risk of cardiac morbidity and mortality through short-term increases in systemic arterial vascular narrowing, as manifested by increased peripheral blood pressure.",6.3.2.6,Blood Pressure,4.1.8.2,Epidemiologic Panel Studies

Chronic exposure has been associated with decreased lung function in children and adolescents. This study investigated the effects of long-term exposure to O3 on lung function in college freshmen.

Methods: We recruited University of California, Berkeley students (n = 255) who were lifelong residents of the Los Angeles and San Francisco Bay areas and who never smoked. Lifetime exposures to O3, small particulate matter (PM10), and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) were based on spatial interpolation of compliance monitor measurements to all residences at which students lived. Spirometry was performed between February and May, times when students would not have had recent exposure to increased levels of O3.

Results: Lifetime exposure to O3 was associated with decreased levels of measures of small airways (<2 mm) function (FEF75 and FEF25?75). There was an interaction with the FEF25?75/FVC ratio, a measure of intrinsic airway size. Subjects with a large ratio were less likely to have decreases in FEF75 and FEF25?75 for a given estimated lifetime exposure to O3. This association was not altered by history of chronic respiratory disease, allergy, second-hand exposure to environmental tobacco smoke, exposure to PM10 and NO2, or measurement errors in exposure assessment.

Conclusions: A history of increased level of lifetime exposure to ambient O3 is associated with decreased function of airways in which O3 deposition in the lungs is the greatest. Adolescents with intrinsically smaller airways appear to be at greatest risk. Any environmental or genetic factors that lead to reduced airway size may lead to increased susceptibility to the adverse effects of ambient ozone.",7.2.3.1,Pulmonary Structure and Function: Evidence from Epidemiology Studies,0,0

Methods.Exposures averaged during periods that varied from 1 to 7 days were used to assess the effects of air pollutants, including thoracic particulate matter (PM10), fine (PM2.5) and coarse (PM10-2.5) particulate matter, carbon monoxide (CO), sulfur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), and ozone (O3), on hospitalization for respiratory infections. A case-crossover design was used to calculate odds ratios for the hospitalization adjusted for daily weather conditions with an incremented exposure corresponding to the interquartile range in air pollution exposures. 
Results.When particulate matter and gaseous pollutants were mutually taken into account, the effect remained pronounced for PM10-2.5 in both boys and girls. The adjusted odds ratio for 6-day average exposure to PM10-2.5 with an increment of 6.5 Ag/m3 was 1.15 (95% confidence interval: 1.02-1.30) for boys and 1.18 (95% confidence interval: 1.01-1.36) for girls.

METHODS: Breath samples were collected weekly between September and December 2000 in a community based group of elderly subjects (median age 70.7 years) in Steubenville, Ohio. The samples were analysed for NO. Air pollution levels were measured concurrently at a central site monitor. 

RESULTS: An increase in the 24 hour average PM(2.5) concentration of 17.7 micro g/m(3) was associated with an increase in FE(NO) of 1.45 ppb (95% CI 0.33 to 2.57) in models adjusted for subject, week of study, day of the week, hour of the day, ambient barometric pressure, temperature, and relative humidity.

OBJECTIVE: Our cross-sectional study was intended to analyse the associations between long-term exposure to background air pollution and atopic and respiratory outcomes in a large population-based sample of schoolchildren. METHODS: Six thousand six hundred and seventy-two children aged 9-11 years recruited from 108 randomly schools in six French cities underwent a clinical examination including a skin prick test (SPT) to common allergens, exercise-induced bronchial reactivity (EIB) and skin examination for flexural dermatitis. The prevalence of asthma, allergic rhinitis (AR) and atopic dermatitis was assessed by a standardized health questionnaire completed by the parents. Three-year-averaged concentrations of air pollutants (NO2, SO2, PM10 and O3) were calculated at children' schools using measurements of background monitoring stations. RESULTS: After adjusting for confounders, EIB, lifetime asthma and lifetime AR were found to be positively related to an increase in the exposure to SO2, PM10 and O3. The adjusted odds ratios (aOR) per increase of 5 microg/m3 of SO2 was 1.39 (95% confidence interval (CI)=1.15-1.66) for EIB and 1.19 (1.00-1.41) for lifetime asthma. The aOR for lifetime AR per increase of 10 microg/m3 of PM10 was 1.32 (CI=1.04-1.68). Moreover, SPT positivity was associated with O3 (aOR=1.34; CI=1.24-1.46). Associations with past year symptoms were consistent, even if not always statistically significant. Results persisted in long-term resident (current address for at least 8 years) children. However, no consistent positive association was found with NO2.

Traffic density is seen to be a significant and robust predictor of survival in this cohort, more so than ambient air quality, with the possible exception of ozone. Stronger effects of traffic density are seen in the counties that have ambient air quality monitoring data, which also tend to have higher levels of traffic density. These proportional-hazard modeling results indicate only modest changes in traffic-related mortality risks over time, from 1976-2001, despite the decline in regulated tailpipe emissions per vehicle since the mid-1970s. This suggests that other environmental effects may be involved, such as particles from brake, tire, and road wear, traffic noise, psychological stress, and spatial gradients in socioeconomic status.",7.7,Mortality,0,0

For individuals with COPD, interquartile range (IQR) increases in 4-hr ambient PM2.5 (11.65 microg/m3)) and nitrogen dioxide (11.97 ppb) were associated with 8.3% [95% confidence interval (CI), 1.7-15.3%] and 7.7% (95% CI, 0.1-15.9%) increase in the SD of normal R-R intervals (SDNN), respectively. For individuals with MI, IQR increases in 4-hr PM2.5 (8.54 microg/m3) and NO2 (9.25 ppb) were associated with a nonsignificant 2.9% (95% CI, -7.8 to 2.3) and significant 12.1 (95% CI, -19.5 to -4.0) decrease in SDNN. Beta-blocker and bronchodilator intake and baseline forced expiratory volume in 1 sec modified the PM-SDNN association significantly, with effects consistent with those by disease group.

We carried out this mortality time series study in Montreal, Quebec, Canada to confirm these observations and to determine whether diabetics who had other health conditions were also at higher risk of dying when air pollution increases. METHODS AND RESULTS: In one analysis, we related daily deaths from diabetes (using the underlying cause) to daily concentrations of particles and gaseous pollutants. In another analysis, we created subgroups by identifying subjects diagnosed 1 year before death with diabetes and other major health conditions from billing and prescription data from the universal Quebec Health Insurance Plan. The analysis made use of parametric log-linear Poisson models that were adjusted for long-term temporal trends and daily weather conditions. We found positive associations between most air pollutants and daily mortality from diabetes as well as among subjects diagnosed with diabetes 1 year before death. In the latter group of subjects, greater effects were found generally in the warm season and especially among subjects who had diabetes and who also had any cardiovascular disease, chronic coronary disease, and atherosclerosis. We did not find evidence of associations among persons who only had diabetes (i.e., did not also have cancer, cardiovascular disease, or lower respiratory disease).

We speculated that the effects we observed previously for carbon monoxide, particulate matter < 10 microm in aerodynamic diameter (PM10), and traffic density were attributable to toxins sorbed to primary exhaust particles. Focusing on CO, PM10, and particulate matter < 2.5 microm in aerodynamic diameter (PM2.5), we examined whether varying residential distances from monitoring stations affected risk estimates, because effect attenuation may result from local pollutant heterogeneity inadequately captured by ambient stations. We geocoded home locations, calculated the distance to the nearest air monitors, estimated exposure levels by pregnancy period, and performed logistic regression analyses for subjects living within 1-4 mi of a station. For women residing within a 1-mi distance, we observed a 27% increase in risk for high (> or = 75th percentile) first-trimester CO exposures and preterm birth and a 36% increase for high third-trimester pregnancy CO exposures and term LBW. For particles, we observed similar size effects during early and late pregnancy for both term LBW and preterm birth. In contrast, smaller or no effects were observed beyond a 1-mi distance of a residence from a station. Associations between CO and PM10 averaged over the whole pregnancy and term LBW were generally smaller than effects for early and late pregnancy. These new results for 1994-2000 generally confirm our previous observations for the period 1989-1993, again linking CO and particle exposures to term LBW and preterm birth.

The purpose of this study was to examine the association between LBW among term infants and ambient air pollution, by trimester of exposure, in a region of lower level exposures. METHODS: The relationship between LBW and ambient levels of particulate matter up to 10 um in diameter (PM10), sulfur dioxide (SO2) and ground-level ozone (O3) was evaluated using the Nova Scotia Atlee Perinatal Database and ambient air monitoring data from the Environment Canada National Air Pollution Surveillance Network and the Nova Scotia Department of Environment. The cohort consisted of live singleton births (> or =37 weeks of gestation) between January 1, 1988 and December 31, 2000. Maternal exposures to air pollution were assigned to women living within 25 km of a monitoring station at the time of birth. Air pollution was evaluated as a continuous and categorical variable (using quartile exposures) for each trimester and relative risks were estimated from logistic regression, adjusted for confounding variables. RESULTS: There were 74,284 women with a term, singleton birth during the study period and with exposure data. In the analyses unadjusted for year of birth, first trimester exposures in the highest quartile for SO2 and PM10 suggested an increased risk of delivering a LBW infant (relative risk = 1.36, 95% confidence interval = 1.04 to 1.78 for SO2 exposure and relative risk = 1.33, 95% confidence interval = 1.02 to 1.74 for PM10). After adjustment for birth year, the relative risks were attenuated somewhat and not statistically significant. A dose-response relationship for SO2 was noted with increasing levels of exposure. No statistically significant effects were noted for ozone. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that exposure during the first trimester to relatively low levels of some air pollutants may be associated with a reduction in birth weight in term-born infants.

The proportional hazards model included individual data on age, race, smoking, body mass index, height, blood pressure, and selected interactions; contextual variables also controlled for climate, education, and income.

The effects of the other main constituents of PM2.5, of crustal particles, and of peak levels of CO, O3, or SO2 appear to be less important. Traffic density is also consistently the most important environmental predictor in multiple-pollutant models, with combined relative risks up to about 1.2. However, from these findings it is not possible to discern which aspects of traffic (pollution, noise, stress) may be the most relevant to public health or whether an area-based predictor such as traffic density may have an inherent advantage over localized measures of ambient air quality. It is also possible that traffic density could be a marker for unmeasured pollutants or for geographic gradients per se.

Recent findings suggest that exposure to outdoor air pollutants may increase the risk of allergic rhinitis. The results of these studies are inconsistent, but warrant further attention. The objective of the study was to assess the effect of relation between exposure to urban air pollution and the prevalence allergic rhinitis among school children.

Methods
We conducted a nationwide cross-sectional study of 32,143 Taiwanese school children. We obtained routine air-pollution monitoring data for sulphur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen oxides (NOx), ozone (O3), carbon monoxide (CO), and particles with an aerodynamic diameter of 10 ?m or less (PM10). A parent-administered questionnaire provided information on individual characteristics and indoor environments (response rate 92%). Municipal-level exposure was calculated using the mean of the 2000 monthly averages. The effect estimates were presented as odds ratios (ORs) per 10 ppb change for SO2, NOx, and O3, 100 ppb change for CO, and 10 ?g/m3 change for PM10.

Results
In two-stage hierarchical model adjusting for confounding, the prevalence of allergic rhinitis was significantly associated with SO2 (adjusted odds ratio (OR) = 1.43, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.25, 1.64), CO (aOR = 1.05, 95% CI: 1.04, 1.07), and NOx (aOR = 1.11, 95% CI: 1.08, 1.15). Contrary to our hypothesis, the prevalence of allergic rhinitis was weakly or not related to O3 (aOR = 1.05, 95% CI: 0.98, 1.12) and PM10 (aOR = 1.00, 95% CI: 0.99, 1.02).

DESIGN: Associations were assessed using the case-crossover method for seven cities: Auckland and Christchurch, New Zealand; and Brisbane, Canberra, Melbourne, Perth, and Sydney Australia. Results were combined across cities using a random-effects meta-analysis and stratified for two adult age groups: 15-64 years and >/= 65 years of age (elderly). Pollutants considered were nitrogen dioxide, carbon monoxide, daily measures of particulate matter (PM) and ozone. Where multiple pollutant associations were found, a matched case-control analysis was used to identify the most consistent association. RESULTS: In the elderly, all pollutants except O3 were significantly associated with five categories of cardiovascular disease admissions. No associations were found for arrhythmia and stroke. For a 0.9-ppm increase in CO, there were significant increases in elderly hospital admissions for total cardiovascular disease (2.2%) , all cardiac disease (2.8%), cardiac failure (6.0%), ischemic heart disease (2.3%), and myocardial infarction (2.9%). There was some heterogeneity between cities, possibly due to differences in humidity and the percentage of elderly people. In matched analyses, CO had the most consistent association. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that air pollution arising from common emission sources for CO, NO2, and PM (e.g., motor vehicle exhausts) has significant associations with adult cardiovascular hospital admissions, especially in the elderly, at air pollution concentrations below normal health guidelines. Relevance to clinical and professional practice: Elderly populations in Australia need to be protected from air pollution arising from outdoor sources to reduce cardiovascular disease.",6.3.2.7,Hospital Admissions and Emergency Department Visits,0,0

An association between traffic-related air pollution and AMI has been suggested, but the evidence is still limited. Objectives: to evaluate in a multi-centre study association between hospitalisation for first AMI and daily levels of traffic-related air pollution. Methods: We collected data on first AMI hospitalisations in 5 European cities. AMI registers were available in Augsburg and Barcelona; hospital discharge registers (HDRs) were used in Helsinki, Rome and Stockholm. NO2, CO and PM10 (particles <10 mu m) were measured at central monitoring sites. Particle number concentration (PNC), a proxy for ultrafine particles (<0.1 mu m), was measured for a year in each centre, and then modelled retrospectively for the whole study period. We used generalized additive models for statistical analyses. Age and 28-day fatality and season were considered as potential effect modifiers in the 3 HDR centres. Results: Nearly 27 000 cases of first AMI were recorded. There was a suggestion of an association of the same day CO and PNC levels with AMI: RR=1.005 (95% confidence interval: 1.000-1.010) per 0.2 mg/m3 and RR=1.005 (95%CI: 0.996-1.015) per 10000 particles/cm3, respectively. However, associations were only observed in the 3 cities with HDR, where power for city-specific analyses was higher. We observed in these cities the most consistent associations among fatal cases aged <75 years: RR at 1-day lag for CO=1.021 (95%CI: 1.000-1.048) per 0.2 mg/m3, for PNC= 1.058 (95% CI: 1.012-1.107) per 10000 particles/cm3, and for NO2=1.032 (95%CI: 0.998-1.066) per 8 mu g/m3.

Short-term effects of carbon monoxide, nitrogen dioxide, particulate matter less than 10 mum in aerodynamic diameter (PM10), sulfur dioxide, and warm-season ozone were examined in both one-pollutant and two-pollutant models, using lags of up to 2 days. Lags in carbon monoxide and nitrogen dioxide were positively associated with both measures of asthma exacerbation, and the 3-day moving sum of sulfur dioxide levels was marginally related to asthma symptoms. PM10 and ozone were unrelated to exacerbations. The strongest effects tended to be seen with 2-day lags, where a 1-parts-per-million change in carbon monoxide and a 20-parts-per-billion change in nitrogen dioxide were associated with symptom odds ratios of 1.08 (95% confidence interval (CI): 1.02, 1.15) and 1.09 (95% CI: 1.03, 1.15), respectively, and with rate ratios for rescue inhaler use of 1.06 (95% CI: 1.01, 1.10) and 1.05 (95% CI: 1.01, 1.09), respectively.

AIMS: To assess the association of community exposures to air pollution with ventricular arrhythmias in a cohort of ICD patients in metropolitan St Louis, Missouri. METHODS: ICD detected episodes reported during clinical follow up were abstracted and reviewed by an electrophysiologist to identify ventricular arrhythmias. A total of 139 ventricular arrhythmias were identified among 56 patients. A case-crossover design was used with control periods matched on weekday and hour of the day within the same calendar month. Conditional logistic regression models were adjusted for temperature, barometric pressure, and relative humidity in the 24 hours preceding the event.

There is evidence that maternal exposure to ambient air pollution during pregnancy is associated with adverse birth outcomes.

Objective? To assess preterm birth (PTB) in relation to maternal exposure to ambient air pollution.

Design? Retrospective cohort.

Setting? Brisbane, Australia.

Sample? A total of 28 200 singleton live births for the period of 1 July 2000 to 30 June 2003.

Methods? Average maternal exposure estimates for ambient particulate matter (PM10 and bsp), ozone (O3) and nitrogen dioxide were calculated over the first 3 months after last menstrual period (LMP) and the last 3 months prior to birth (individually and combined as trimesters).

Main outcome measures? PTB was defined as gestation <37 weeks and odds ratios (OR) were calculated for PTB per interquartile range increase in the maternal exposure estimate for each pollutant. Various covariates were controlled for, including season of birth.

METHODS: Linking birth and death certificates for infants who died between 1989 and 2000, we identified all infant deaths, matched 10 living control subjects to each case subject, and assigned the nearest air monitoring station to each birth address. For all subjects, we calculated average carbon monoxide, nitrogen dioxide, ozone, and particulate matter < 10 microm in aerodynamic diameter exposures experienced during the 2-week, 1-month, 2-month, and 6-month periods before a case subject's death. RESULTS: The risk of respiratory death increased from 20% to 36% per 1-ppm increase in average carbon monoxide levels 2 weeks before death in early infancy (age: 28 days to 3 months). We also estimated 7% to 12% risk increases for respiratory deaths per 10-microg/m3 increase in particulate matter < 10 microm in aerodynamic diameter exposure experienced 2 weeks before death for infants 4 to 12 months of age. Risk of respiratory death more than doubled for infants 7 to 12 months of age who were exposed to high average levels of particulates in the previous 6 months. Furthermore, the risk of dying as a result of sudden infant death syndrome increased 15% to 19% per 1-part per hundred million increase in average nitrogen dioxide levels 2 months before death.

We developed a model for ammonia bioindication, a major nitrogen pollutant in the region, using epiphytic macrolichens. We used non-metric multidimensional scaling to extract gradients in lichen community composition from surveys at 115 forested sites. A strong ammonia deposition gradient was detected, as evidenced by a high linear correlation with an index of ammonia indicator species conventionally known as onitrophyteso (r = 0.93). This gradient, however, was confounded by elevation (r = -0.54). We evaluated three statistical techniques for controlling the influence of elevation on nitrophytes: simple linear regression, nonlinear regression, and nonparametric regression. We used the unstandardized residuals from nonlinear regression to estimate relative ammonia deposition at each plot, primarily because this model had the best fit (r 2 = 0.33), desirable asymptotic properties, and it is easy to apply to new data. Other possible sources of noise in the nitrophyte-ammonia relationship, such as substrate pH and acidic deposition, are discussed. Lichen communities indicated relatively high deposition to forests of the southern Sierra Nevada, the Modoc Plateau, as well as in stands near urban areas. Evidence of elevated ammonia was also detected for popular recreation areas such as Sequoia and Yosemite National Parks. Lichen communities from forests in the Tahoe basin, northern Sierra Nevada, southern Cascades, and eastern Klamath Range appeared considerably less impacted.

In the presence of differing levels of measurement error across pollutants under consideration, however, they can be biased and as misleading as single-pollutant models. Their appropriate interpretation depends on the relationships among the pollutant measurements and the outcomes in question. In situations where two or more pollutant variables may be acting as surrogates for the etiologic agent(s), multipollutant models can help identify the best surrogate, but the risk estimates may be influenced by inclusion of a second variable that is not itself an independent risk factor for the outcome in question. In this paper, these issues will be illustrated in the context of an ongoing study of emergency visits in Atlanta. Emergency department visits from 41 of 42 hospitals serving the twenty-county Atlanta metropolitan area for the period 1993-2004 (n=10,206,389 visits) were studied in relation to ambient pollutant levels, including speciated particle measurements from an intensive monitoring campaign at a downtown station starting in 1998. Relative to our earlier publications, reporting results through 2000, the period for which the speciated data are now available is now tripled (six years in length). Poisson generalized linear models were used to examine outcome counts in relation to three-day moving average concentrations of pollutants of a priori interest (ozone, nitrogen dioxide, carbon monoxide, sulfur dioxide, oxygenated hydrocarbons, PM10, coarse PM, PM2.5, and the following components of PM2.5: elemental carbon, organic carbon, sulfate, water-soluble transition metals.) In the present analysis, we report results for two outcome groups: a respiratory outcomes group and a cardiovascular outcomes group. For cardiovascular visits, associations were observed with CO, 3 NO2, and PM2.5 elemental carbon and organic carbon. In multipollutant models, CO was the strongest predictor. For respiratory visits, associations were observed with ozone, PM10, CO and NO2 in single-pollutant models. In multipollutant models, PM10 and ozone persisted as predictors, with ozone the stronger predictor.

Pathways by which particles may act involve autonomic nervous system dysfunction or inflammation, which can affect cardiac rate and rhythm. The importance of these pathways may vary by particle component or source. In an eastern US location with significant regional pollution, the authors examined the association of air pollution and odds of cardiac arrhythmia in older adults. 
Methods: Thirty two non-smoking older adults were evaluated on a weekly basis for 24 weeks during the summer and autumn of 2000 with a standardised 30 minute protocol that included continuous electrocardiogram measurements. A central ambient monitoring station provided daily concentrations of fine particles (PM2.5, sulfate, elemental carbon) and gases. Sulfate was used as a marker of regional pollution. The authors used logistic mixed effects regression to examine the odds of having any supraventricular ectopy (SVE) or ventricular ectopy (VE) in association with increases in air pollution for moving average pollutant concentrations up to 10 days before the health assessment. 
Results: Participant specific mean counts of arrhythmia over the protocol varied between 0.1-363 for SVE and 0-350 for VE. The authors observed odds ratios for having SVE over the length of the protocol of 1.42 (95% CI 0.99 to 2.04), 1.70 (95% CI 1.12 to 2.57), and 1.78 (95% CI 0.95 to 3.35) for 10.0 microg/m3, 4.2 microg/m3, and 14.9 ppb increases in five day moving average PM2.5, sulfate, and ozone concentrations respectively. The other pollutants, including elemental carbon, showed no effect on arrhythmia. Participants reporting cardiovascular conditions (for example, previous myocardial infarction or hypertension) were the most susceptible to pollution induced SVE.

The regression coefficients were based on an inter-quartile range (IQR) increase in exposure as well as quartiles of exposure with the lowest used as a reference category. Trimester- and monthly specific exposures to all pollutants were not significantly associated with a reduction in either birth weight or HC, or an increased risk of SGA. An IQR increase in NO(2) during the third trimester was associated with a reduction in CHL (beta=-0.15cm, 95% CI -0.25 to -0.05cm) and this was concentrated around exposure during month nine.

Objective: To compare the 2-min tidal-breathing and the five-breath dosimeter methacholine challenges.

Results: The dosimeter provocation concentration of methacholine causing a 20% fall in FEV1 (PC20) was almost twice that of the tidal-breathing PC20: 2.4 mg/mL vs 1.3 mg/mL (paired t test, p < 0.00005).

Objectives: To investigate whether biological mechanisms linking air pollution to cardiovascular events occurred concurrently in human subjects exposed to urban air pollutants. 

Methods: We recruited a panel of 76 young, healthy students from a university in Taipei. Between April and June of 2004 or 2005, three measurements were made in each participant of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG), plasminogen activator fibrinogen inhibitor-1 (PAI-1), tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA) in plasma, and heart rate variability (HRV). Gaseous air pollutants were measured at one air-monitoring station inside their campus, and particulate air pollutants were measured at one particulate matter supersite monitoring station 1 km from their campus. We used linear mixed-effects models to associate biological endpoints with individual air pollutants averaged over 1- to 3-day periods before measurements were performed. 

Measurements and Main Results: We found that increases in hs-CRP, 8-OHdG, fibrinogen, and PAI-1, and decreases in HRV indices were associated with increases in levels of particles with aerodynamic diameters less than 10 Am and 2.5 Am, sulfate, nitrate, and ozone (O3) in single-pollutant models. The increase in 8-OHdG, fibrinogen, and PAI-1, and the reduction in HRV remained significantly associated with 3-day averaged sulfate and O3 levels in two-pollutant models. There were moderate correlations (r = -0.3) between blood markers of hs-CRP, fibrinogen, PAI-1, and HRV indices.

The authors evaluated the association between exposure to particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter of <2.5 microm (PM2.5) and onset of symptom exacerbation leading to hospital admission in Baltimore, Maryland. They used a case-crossover design for 135 case events occurring among 125 persons with prevalent congestive heart failure who were admitted to a single hospital through the emergency department during 2002. The case period was assigned using three index times: 8-hour and 24-hour periods of symptom onset and date of hospital admission. Controlling for weather, the authors detected a modest relative increase in risk for cases defined by 8-hour symptom onset for an interquartile-range increase in PM2.5 at a 2-day lag (odds ratio=1.09, 95% confidence interval: 0.91, 1.30). A corresponding increase in risk was not observed when admission date was used to define the case period. A series of simulations based on study data indicated that the study had adequate statistical power to detect odds ratios of 1.2 or higher. Although overall findings were not statistically significant, the identification of case events defined by an 8-hour onset period may be more relevant than either a 24-hour onset period or the admission date for estimating harmful effects of air pollutant exposure on cardiovascular health.

The issue is of particular importance due to the frequency, intensity, and health effects of Asian sandstorms. This work investigates the relationship between cause-specific hospital admissions and sandstorms and air pollution in Taipei, Taiwan's capital. METHODS: Time-series analyses of asthma, pneumonia, ischemic heart disease, and cerebrovascular disease hospital admissions were performed for Taipei. An 8-year time period (1995-2002) was considered for various indicators of sandstorms and the pollutants NO2, CO, ozone, SO2, PM10, and PM2.5. Pollution effects based on single-day lags of 0, 1, 2, and 3 days were explored, along with the average of the same day and previous three days (L03). RESULTS: The risk of ischemic heart disease admissions was associated with several sandstorm metrics, including indicators of high PM10 levels in the Taipei area, indicators of high PM10 at a monitor designed to measure background pollution, the PM coarse fraction, and the ratio of PM10 to PM2.5. However, the lag structure of effect was not consistent across sandstorm indicators. Hospital admissions for this disease were 16 to 21% higher on sandstorm days compared to other days. This cause was also associated with transportation-related pollutants, NO2, CO, and PM2.5. Asthma admissions rose 4.48% (95% confidence interval 0.71, 8.38%) per 28 microgm/m3 increase in L03 PM10 levels and 7.60% (95% confidence interval 2.87, 12.54%) per 10 ppb increase in L03 ozone. Cerebrovascular disease admissions were associated with PM10 and CO, both at lag 3 days. SO2 exhibited no relationship with admissions. CONCLUSIONS: Risk of hospital admissions in Taipei may be increased by air pollution and sandstorms.

METHODS: DNA damage (Comet assay) and personal exposure to volatile organic compounds, PM(2.5), and ozone were investigated in 55 outdoor and indoor workers from MUxico City and Puebla. RESULTS: In MUxico City, outdoor workers had greater DNA damage, reflected by a longer tail length, than indoor workers (median 46.8 v 30.1 mum), and a greater percentage of highly damaged cells (cells with tail length > or =41 microm); in Puebla, outdoor and indoor workers had similar DNA damage.

The Millennium Ecosystem Assessment is modeled on the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and will provide information requested by governments, through four international conventions, as well as meeting needs within the private sector and civil society. Ecosystems and Human Well-being offers an overview of the assessment, describing the conceptual framework that is being used, defining its scope and providing a baseline of understanding that all participants need to move forward.

The Millennium Ecosystem Assessment focuses on how humans have altered ecosystems, and how changes in ecosystems have affected human well-being. The assessment also evaluates how ecosystem changes may affect people in future decades and what responses can be adopted at local, national, or global scales to improve ecosystem management and thereby contribute to human well-being and poverty alleviation. The assessment was launched by United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan in June 2001, and the primary assessment reports will be released by Island Press in 2005.

The Millennium Ecosystem Assessment series is an invaluable new resource for professionals and policy-makers concerned with international development, environmental science, environmental policy, and related fields. It will help both in choosing among existing options and in identifying new approaches for achieving integrated management of land, water, and living resources while strengthening regional, national, and local capacities. The Millennium Ecosystem Assessment series will also improve policy and decision-making at all levels by increasing collaboration between natural and social scientists, and between scientists and policy-makers.

Studies using administrative data report a positive association between ambient air pollution and the risk of hospitalization for congestive heart failure (HF). Circulating levels of B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) are directly associated with cardiac hemodynamics and symptom severity in patients with HF and, therefore, serves as a marker of functional status. We tested the hypothesis that BNP levels would be positively associated with short-term changes in ambient pollution levels among 28 patients with chronic stable HF and impaired systolic function.
Methods
BNP was measured in whole blood at 0, 6, and 12 weeks. We used linear mixed models to evaluate the association between fine particulate matter (PM2.5), carbon monoxide, sulfur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide, ozone, and black carbon and log(BNP). Lags of 0 to 3 days were considered in separate models. We calculated the intraclass correlation coefficient and within-subject coefficient of variation as measures of reproducibility.
Results
We found no association between any pollutant and measures of BNP at any lag. For example, a 10 Ag/m3 increase in PM2.5 was associated with a 0.8% (95% CI: -16.4, 21.5; p = 0.94) increase in BNP on the same day. The within-subject coefficient of variation was 45% on the natural scale and 9% on the log scale.
Conclusion
These results suggest that serial BNP measurements are unlikely to be useful in a longitudinal study of air pollution-related acute health effects. The magnitude of expected ambient air pollution health effects appears small in relation to the considerable within-person variability in BNP levels in this population.",6.3.2.4,Biomarkers,0,0

RESULTS: We found graded, significant reductions in both high-frequency and low-frequency powers of heart rate variability in relation to ozone and sulfate across the quartiles of tibia lead. Interquartile range increases in ozone and sulfate were associated respectively, with 38% decrease (95% confidence interval = -54.6% to -14.9%) and 22% decrease (-40.4% to 1.6%) in high frequency, and 38% decrease (-51.9% to -20.4%) and 12% decrease (-28.6% to 9.3%) in low frequency, in the highest quartile of tibia lead after controlling for potential confounders.

The present study aims at estimating the association between particles with diameter < 10 mum (PM SUB 10), nitrogen dioxide (NO SUB 2) and ozone and hospitalizations for cardiovascular diseases in eight French cities during the 1998-2003 period. 

METHODS: The daily number of hospitalizations in each city was extracted from the French hospital information system (PMSI) for cardiovascular diseases, cardiac diseases, ischemic heart diseases and stroke. Excess relative risks (ERRs) of hospitalization associated with a 10 mug/m SUP 3 increase in pollutant levels were estimated in each city by fitting a Poisson regression model, controlling for well-known confounding factors and temporal trends. City-specific results were then combined by inverse variance weighting. 

RESULTS: Daily number of hospitalizations for cardiovascular diseases was associated with PM SUB 10 levels (for a 10 mug/m SUP 3 increase, ERR = 0.8%, 95% CI: [0.2, 1.5]), with NO SUB 2 (1.1%, [0.6, 1.6]) but not with ozone (0.1% [- 0.2%, 0.5%]). Associations were stronger in people aged 65 years and over, and when only hospitalizations for ischemic heart diseases were considered. No association was found between strokes and air pollution levels. 

DISCUSSION: Our study suggests that the ambient levels of air pollutants currently experienced in the eight French cities, which are close to European air quality guidelines, are yet linked to a short term increase of hospitalizations for cardiovascular diseases.

The updated guidelines emphasize the importance of asthma control. Asthma control is the degree to which the manifestations of asthma are minimized by therapeutic intervention and the goals of therapy are met. Because asthma is highly variable, the level of control must be monitored on a periodic basis to determine whether therapy should be maintained or adjusted (stepped up if necessary, stepped down if possible). On the other hand, asthma severity is the intrinsic intensity of the disease process, most easily and directly measured in a patient not receiving long-term control therapy. For managing asthma, the recommendation is to assess severity to initiate therapy and assess control to adjust therapy.

Recommendations for managing asthma include an expanded section on childhood asthma with addition of an age group 5 to 11 years old (earlier guidelines combined this group with adults). The guidelines provide new recommendations on patient education in settings beyond the physician's office, and new advice for controlling environmental factors that can cause asthma symptoms.

The concepts of current impairment (frequency and intensity of symptoms, low lung function, and limitations of daily activities) and future risk (likelihood of exacerbations, progressive loss of lung function, or adverse side effects from medications) support a new approach to assessing and monitoring the patient's level of asthma control through use of multiple measures. The guidelines stress that some patients can still be at high risk for frequent exacerbations even if they have few day-to-day effects of asthma.

Moreover, EPR-3 confirms the importance of teaching patients skills to self-monitor and manage asthma and to use a written asthma action plan, which should include instructions for daily treatment and ways to recognize and handle worsening asthma. New recommendations encourage expanding educational opportunities to reach patients in a variety of settings, such as pharmacies, schools, community centers, and patients' homes. A new section addresses the need for clinician education programs to improve communication with patients and to use system-wide approaches to integrate the guidelines into health care practice.

The guidelines describe new evidence for using multiple approaches to limit exposure to allergens and other substances that can worsen asthma; research shows that single steps are rarely sufficient. EPR-3 also expands the section on common conditions that can affect asthma and notes that management of these conditions may help to improve asthma control.

Expert Panel Report 3 continues the use of a stepwise approach to control asthma. When assessing the level of asthma control to determine the need for adjusting therapy, EPR-3 reconfirms the importance of assessing patient adherence to medication, inhaler technique, and environmental control measures before making a step up in therapy.

The stepwise approach expands from 4 steps to 6 steps of care. Medications have been repositioned within these 6 steps. Recommendations on medications are updated to reflect the latest evidence on effectiveness and safety. EPR-3 reaffirms that patients with persistent asthma need both long-term control medications to control asthma and prevent exacerbations and quick-relief medication for symptoms, as needed. EPR-3 also reaffirms that inhaled corticosteroids are the most effective long-term control medication across all age groups. New recommendations on treatment options such as leukotriene receptor antagonists and cromolyn for long-term control; long-acting ?-agonists as adjunct therapy with inhaled corticosteroids; omalizumab for severe asthma; and albuterol, levalbuterol, and corticosteroids for acute exacerbations are included.",7.2.1.1,New Onset Asthma,0,0

RESULTS: Analysis was hindered by data availability. In the 93 communities with PM10 data, only 25.0% of study days had data on both ozone and PM10. In the 91 communities with PM2.5 data, only 9.2% of days in the study period had data on ozone and PM2.5. Neither PM measure was highly correlated with ozone at any level of ozone or PM. National and community-specific effect estimates of the short-term effects of ozone on mortality were robust to inclusion of PM10 or PM(2.)5 in time-series models. The robustness remains even at low ozone levels (< 10 ppb) using a subset approach.CONCLUSIONS: Results provide evidence that neither PM10 nor PM(2.)5 is a likely confounder of observed ozone and mortality relationships.

Objective: To determine the importance of the pollutants such as ozone (O(3)), particles (PM(10)), nitrogen dioxide (NO(2)) and sulphur dioxide (SO(2)) in the clinical course of mild-moderate pollen-allergic asthmatic patients from two Spanish towns in La Mancha: Puertollano (high pollution levels) and Ciudad Real (low pollution levels). Methods: We used a Poisson regression model to study a cohort of 137 patients from Puertollano and Ciudad Real during two pollen seasons (2000-2001) and analysed the relationship between air pollutant and pollen levels and daily symptoms, the medication used and peak-flow measurements. Results: The number of asthma symptoms and the mean values of the PM(10), SO(2) and NO(2) levels were higher in Puertollano than in Ciudad Real. In Puertollano, the risk of asthma increased by 6% with a 3-day lag for PM(10), by 8% with a 3-day lag for O(3), by 4% with a 1-day lag for SO(2) and by 15% with a 3-day lag for O(3) when its values exceeded the health threshold (P < 0.05).

We hypothesized that pollution originating in different locations has different associations with heart rate variability (HRV) among 497 men from the Normative Aging Study in Boston, Massachusetts. We identified the paths that air masses traveled ('back-trajectories') before arriving in Boston on the days the men were examined. Next, we classified these trajectories into six clusters. We examined whether the association of measured air pollutants with HRV (standard deviation of normal-to-normal intervals, high-frequency power (HF) and low-frequency power (LF), and LF/HF ratio) differed by cluster. We also examined whether the clusters alone (not considering air pollution measurements) showed different associations with HRV. The effects of black carbon (BC) on all HRV measures were strongest on days with southwest trajectories. Subjects who were examined on days where air parcels came from west had the strongest associations with ozone. All particle pollutants (particulate matter <2.5 m in aerodynamic diameter (PM2.5), BC, and sulfates) were associated with increased LF/HF ratio on days with relatively short trajectories, which are related to local, slow-moving air masses. We also observed significant increases in LF/HF in days where air came from the northwest and west, compared to north trajectory days. Health effects associated with exposure to air pollution can be evaluated using pollutant concentrations as well as aspects of the pollution mixture captured by identifying locations where air masses originate.

In this study we examined respiratory effects of ozone in infants who may be vulnerable, particularly if they are children of asthmatic mothers. DESIGN: Women delivering babies at one of five hospitals in southwestern Virginia between 1994 and 1996 were invited to participate in a cohort study; 780 women enrolled. Ambient air quality data (ozone and particulate matter) were collected at a central monitoring site. PARTICIPANTS: This analysis is of 691 infants followed for approximately 83 days between 10 June and 31 August 1995 and/or 1996; they contributed a total of 52,421 infant-days of follow-up. Mothers were interviewed at enrollment and approximately biweekly to report infants daily symptoms. Repeated measures logistic regression models were run separately for wheeze, difficulty breathing, and cough. Ozone metrics included 24-hr average, peak 1-hr, and maximum 8-hr average. Analyses were repeated for the 61 infants whose mothers had asthma. RESULTS: For every interquartile-range increase in same-day 24-hr average ozone, likelihood of wheeze increased 37% [95% confidence interval (CI), 2-84%]. Among infants of asthmatic mothers, same-day 24-hr average ozone increased likelihood of wheeze 59% (95% CI, 1-154%) and of difficulty breathing 83% (95% CI, 42-136%).

We also tested whether growth effects of those gasses were sustained over time. Elevated [CO2] increased tree heights, diameters, and main stem volumes by 11%, 16%, and 20%, respectively, whereas elevated ozone [O-3] decreased them by 11%, 8%, and 29%, respectively. Responses similar to these were found for stand volume and basal area. There were no growth responses to the combination of elevated [CO2+O-3]. The elevated [CO2] growth stimulation was found to be decreasing, but relative growth rates varied considerably from year to year. Neither the variation in annual relative growth rates nor the apparent decline in CO2 growth response could be explained in terms of nitrogen or water limitations. Instead, growth responses to elevated [CO2] and [O-3] interacted strongly with present-day interannual variability in climatic conditions. The amount of photosynthetically active radiation and temperature during specific times of the year coinciding with growth phenology explained 20-63% of the annual variation in growth response to elevated [CO2] and [O-3]. Years with higher photosynthetic photon flux (PPF) during the month of July resulted in more positive growth responses to elevated [CO2] and more negative growth responses to elevated [O-3].

Elevated CO2 increased both male and female flower production, while elevated O3 increased female flower production compared to trees in control rings. Interestingly, very little flowering has yet occurred in combined treatment. Elevated CO2 had significant positive effect on birch catkin size, weight, and germination success rate (elevated CO2 increased germination rate of birch by 110% compared to ambient CO2 concentrations, decreased seedling mortality by 73%, increased seed weight by 17%, increased root length by 59%, and root-to-shoot ratio was significantly decreased, all at 3 weeks after germination), while the opposite was true of elevated O3 (elevated O3 decreased the germination rate of birch by 62%, decreased seed weight by 25%, and increased root length by 15%).

Foliar symptoms were observed on ozone-sensitive bioindicators during each survey year, but the incidence (percentage) of plants exhibiting symptoms was generally low and varied among species and years. Refuge plants that exhibited symptoms included Fraxinus spp. (ash), Populus spp. (aspen), Corylus cornuta (beaked hazelnut), Prunus serotina (black cherry), Prunus pensylvanica (pin cherry), Apocynum androsaemifolium (spreading dogbane), and a viburnum tentatively identified as Viburnum nudum var. cassinoides (withe-rod). Data from the nearest US EPA ozone-monitoring site, located 113 km southwest of the refuge in Acadia National Park, ME, revealed that ambient SUM60 ozone levels during survey years ranged from approximately 17,900 ppb-hrs in 2000 to more than 40,000 ppb-hrs in 1998. Therefore, the threshold level of SUM60 ozone capable of inducing symptoms on sensitive vegetation within this refuge and Class-I Wilderness area is less than 18,000 ppb-hrs, and may be as low as 10,000 ppb-hrs. The results of these surveys can be used by the US Fish and Wildlife Service when making air-quality management decisions, including those related to the review of Prevention of Significant Deterioration permits, and might serve as input into formulating more stringent National Ambient Air Quality Standards for ozone.",9.4.2.1,Biomonitoring,8.2,Visible Foliar Injury and Biomonitoring

Coupled climate-carbon cycle models suggest that global warming will act to limit the land-carbon sink, but these first generation models neglected the impacts of changing atmospheric chemistry. Emissions associated with fossil fuel and biomass burning have acted to approximately double the global mean tropospheric ozone concentration, and further increases are expected over the twenty-first century. Tropospheric ozone is known to damage plants, reducing plant primary productivity and crop yields, yet increasing atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations are thought to stimulate plant primary productivity. Increased carbon dioxide and ozone levels can both lead to stomatal closure, which reduces the uptake of either gas, and in turn limits the damaging effect of ozone and the carbon dioxide fertilization of photosynthesis. Here we estimate the impact of projected changes in ozone levels on the land-carbon sink, using a global land carbon cycle model modified to include the effect of ozone deposition on photosynthesis and to account for interactions between ozone and carbon dioxide through stomatal closure. For a range of sensitivity parameters based on manipulative field experiments, we find a significant suppression of the global land-carbon sink as increases in ozone concentrations affect plant productivity. In consequence, more carbon dioxide accumulates in the atmosphere. We suggest that the resulting indirect radiative forcing by ozone effects on plants could contribute more to global warming than the direct radiative forcing due to tropospheric ozone increases.",9.4.3.4,Ecosystem Productivity and Carbon Sequestration,8.8.3,Terrestrial Carbon Sequestration

However, linkages between growth and ambient ozone concentrations in the field are not well established for forest trees. Ambient ozone concentrations have been shown to cause foliar injury on a number of tree species throughout much of the eastern USA. Symptom expression is influenced by endogenous and exogenous factors and, therefore, ozone-exposure/tree-response relationships have been difficult to confirm. Clearly defined, cause-effect relationships between visible injury and growth losses due to ozone have not been validated. Generalizations of sensitivity of forest trees to ozone are complicated by tree development stage, microclimate, leaf phenology, compensatory processes, within-species variation and other interacting stresses. In general, decreases in above-ground growth at ambient ozone levels in the eastern USA appear to be in the range of 0-10% per year. However, these conclusions are based on a small number of tree species, with the vast majority of studies involving individual tree seedlings in a non-competitive environment. Comparative studies of small and large trees indicate that seedlings are, not suitable surrogates for predicting responses of mature trees to ozone. Process-level modelling is a promising methodology that has been recently utilized to assess ozone effects on a stand to regional scale, indicating that ozone is affecting forest growth in the eastern USA. The extent and magnitude of the response is variable and depends on many edaphic and climatic factors. It is imperative when conducting assessment exercises, however, that forest biologists constantly keep in mind the tremendous variability that exists within natural systems.

The harvesting hypothesis posits that the deaths associated with an exposure are occurring in people who are dying already, and the effect of exposure is merely to move the death from one day to an earlier day, and has no other effects that would influence deaths.

Objectives: The aim of this study was to analyze the effect of ozone on mortality, and the extent to which this is due to short-term mortality displacement in 48 U.S. cities between 1989 and 2000.

Methods: Time series of mortality and ozone were investigated with a generalized linear model during the June?August months, controlling for season, day of the week, and apparent temperature. We examined an unconstrained and a smooth distributed lag with 21 lags of ozone, and effect modification for city-specific characteristics.

Measurements and Main Results: We found a 0.3% (95% confidence interval, 0.2?0.4) increase in total mortality for a 10-ppb increase in 8-hour ozone at lag 0 during summer months. The effect increased to 0.5% (95% confidence interval, 0.05?0.96) when looking at the unconstrained distributed lag. The shape of the distributed lag indicates that all the effect is in the first week.

Conclusions: We did not find mortality displacement due to ozone; rather, the effect size estimate when looking at 21 days of ozone was larger than when using a single day's ozone concentration. Therefore, these results indicate that risk assessments using the single day of ozone exposure are likely to underestimate, rather than overestimate, the public health impact.",6.2.8,Respiratory Mortality,6.3.1,Short Term Ozone Exposure and Mortality: Data Tables

Elevated ozone (mean 32.4 ppb) increased the total phenolic content of leaves and also had minor effects on the concentrations of individual compounds. Elevated ozone increased the net photosynthesis rate of red clover leaves before visible injuries by 21-23%.

A comparison of monitoring data with a transect of mapped values for London suggests that the empirically generated maps include a reasonably realistic description of the regional ozone concentrations and of the urban decrements of ozone concentrations.

Estimates of the health impacts associated with ozone have been calculated from the mapped concentrations and are highly dependent on the metric chosen and thus on the implicit assumptions concerning the threshold concentration for effect (0, 70 or 100 ?g m?3). The year of maximum health impact is also dependent on the metric used. Estimated derived from the annual mean of the daily maximum of the running 8-h mean concentration with a cut-off of 0 ?g m?3 vary little from year-to-year, while the greatest impact was estimated to be in 1995 for annual mean of the daily maximum of the running 8-h mean concentration with a cut-off of 100 ?g m?3. Estimates derived from the annual mean of the daily maximum of the running 8-h mean concentration with a cut-off of 70 ?g m?3 were greatest in 2003, reflecting the fact that this metric (closely related to the SOMO35 metric adopted for European scale integrated assessment modelling) is influenced by both the magnitude of summer photochemical ozone episodes and the extent of titration with local NO emissions (the urban decrement).

Using a metabolomic approach, we investigated inflammatory responses in arachidonic and linoleic acid biochemical cascades (35 metabolites) and the expression of 19 cytokines/chemokines at three time points (2, 6, and 24 hr) following exposure to 1-NN with and without prior long-term O3 exposure. Long-term O3 exposure is associated with biochemical changes that have been shown to render the lung resistant to further O3 exposure. This study indicates that airways of O3-tolerant rats exhibited a low level of chronic inflammation, rendering the lungs more susceptible to other environmental pollutants such as 1-NN. Specifically, a 12.5-mg/kg dose of 1-NN to O3-tolerant rats produced significantly higher levels of cysteinyl-leukotrienes in bronchiolar lavage fluid even when compared to a 50-mg/kg dose of 1-NN in rats exposed to filtered air. Collectively, these results indicate that the combination of exposures as encountered in polluted ambient air are considerably more injurious to the lung than would be anticipated from previous studies employing single exposures.

Exposure to CO in early years of life also had a negative effect on FEV1/FVC and forced expiratory flow between 25% and 75% of FVC (FEF25-75)/FVC. Second trimester exposure to PM10 and exposure to CO in the first 6 years of life had negative effects on forced expiratory flow at 25% of FVC. Prenatal, but not trimester-specific, exposure to CO was negatively associated with FEF25-75. Effects were limited to subgroups, such as children who were African American, those diagnosed with asthma before the age of 2 years, and those exposed to maternal smoking during pregnancy. Conclusion: Prenatal and early-life exposures to CO, PM10, and NO2 have a negative effect on pulmonary function in subgroups of asthmatic children.",7.2.3.1,Pulmonary Structure and Function: Evidence from Epidemiology Studies,0,0

They employ several mechanisms, including phagocytosis and secretion of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species. fMLP, a formylated peptide of bacterial origin, is a potent inducer of phagocyte chemotaxis and is also involved in generating antimicrobial agents such as nitric oxide (NO) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). In this study we analysed the in vitro effects of fMLP on the mobility of the THP-1 cell line, which served as a model for alveolar macrophages. Cell mobility and cytotoxicity were also analysed after pre-exposures to an atmosphere polluted with ozone (0.03-0.5 ppm) followed by a fMLP treatment. Finally, the secreted molecules (H2O2 and NO) were measured after ozone exposures ranging from 5 to 30 min and fMLP action. Activation by fMLP alone induced cell movement, whereas pre-exposure to the ozone concentrations decreased it. Addition of fMLP had different effects on cytotoxicity, mobility and metabolite secretion by the cells: (1) cytotoxicity increased depending on ozone concentrations and exposure times; (2) during the first 5 min and for all ozone concentrations, an average decrease of 50% of activated cell mobility was observed; (3) H2O2 was increased, even in combination with ozone; (4) NO was detected at 731 nM, a result that was not affected by ozone pre-exposure.",6.2.5.3,Alveolar Macrophages ,0,0

Conventional investigation of such effect modification through interaction terms in time-series regression analysis depends on hard-to-verify modeling assumptions, and can be computationally unwieldy. As an alternative, we investigate the use of case-only approaches originally proposed for studying gene-environment interactions.

METHODS: We consider an investigation of whether persons of low socio-economic status (SES) are more susceptible to the effect of high outside temperatures on mortality. If low SES persons are more prevalent among deaths on hot days than on days with more moderate temperatures, then this suggests the group is more susceptible. Extending the case-only theory developed for gene-environment interactions allows this to be described more quantitatively.

RESULTS: Conventionally based analysis estimated that mortality in the Sao Paulo rose by 2.3% (SE 0.3%) for each degree of increase in outside temperature above 20 degrees C. This effect was greater by 1.11% (SE 0.72) in the lowest compared with highest quartile of SES. Case-only analysis estimated the difference in effect to be 1.14% (SE 0.72).

There is little evidence of short-term compensatory reduction in deaths, and estimated PM effects are generally larger for intermediate and longer term time scales of exposure. Although proximity in time matters, with most recent exposure having the largest health impact, there is evidence that the short-term exposure studies capture only a small amount of the overall health effects of long-term repeated exposure to PM.

Whether chronic effects result from long-term exposure to any of these pollutants during childhood is an important unresolved question. Establishing whether acute or chronic effects result from childhood exposure and identifying sensitive subgroups may require integration of biologic mechanisms of lung defenses, injury, and response into the study design and statistical models used in analyses. This review explores the theoretical basis for explaining such adverse effects in light of our contemporary understanding of mechanisms of lung injury and response at the cellular and molecular levels. The rapidly evolving understanding of the effects of air pollution on cellular and molecular levels presents an opportunity to develop and refine innovative biologically based hypotheses about the effects of childhood exposure. We hypothesize that children with low fruit and vegetable intake, low antioxidant levels, high polyunsaturated fat intake, or who have inherited certain alleles for genes involved in lung defenses and immune response regulation may be at increased risk for adverse effects. Because responses to air pollutants of interest are complex and involve a number of pathophysiologic processes, the magnitude of main effects of dietary factors, genes, and gene-environment interactions may be modest for individuals; however, each may make an important contribution to the population burden of preventable respiratory diseases.",7.2.1.1,New Onset Asthma,0,0

OBJECTIVES: We addressed the question of whether the ozone-mortality relationship is entirely a reflection of the adverse effect of ozone, or whether it is, at least in part, an effect of other secondary pollutants.

METHODS: Separate time-series models were fit to 3-6 years of data between 2000 and 2005 from 18 U.S. communities. The association between nonaccidental mortality was examined with ozone alone and with ozone after adjustment for fine particle mass, sulfate, organic carbon, or nitrate concentrations. The effect estimates from each of these models were pooled using a random-effects meta-analysis to obtain an across-community average.

RESULTS: We found a 0.89% [95% confidence interval (CI), 0.45-1.33%] increase in nonaccidental mortality with a 10-ppb increase in same-day 24-hr summertime ozone across the 18 communities. After adjustment for PM(2.5) (particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter <or= 2.5 microm) mass or nitrate, this estimate decreased slightly; but when adjusted for particle sulfate, the estimate was substantially reduced to 0.58% (95% CI, -0.33 to 1.49%).

Few studies have investigated the role of copollutants, such as ozone, in this association. Furthermore, the mechanisms by which PM affects cardiac function remain uncertain. We hypothesized that PM and O(3) induce adverse cardiovascular effects in mice and that these effects are strain dependent. STUDY DESIGN: After implanting radiotelemeters to measure heart rate (HR) and HR variability (HRV) parameters, we exposed C57Bl/6J (B6), C3H/HeJ (HeJ), and C3H/HeOuJ (OuJ) inbred mouse strains to three different daily exposures of filtered air (FA), carbon black particles (CB), or O(3) and CB sequentially [O(3)CB; for CB, 536 +/- 24 microg/m(3); for O(3), 584 +/- 35 ppb (mean +/- SE)]. RESULTS: We observed significant changes in HR and HRV in all strains due to O(3)CB exposure, but not due to sequential FA and CB exposure (FACB). The data suggest that primarily acute HR and HRV effects occur during O(3)CB exposure, especially in HeJ and OuJ mice. For example, HeJ and OuJ mice demonstrated dramatic increases in HRV parameters associated with marked brady-cardia during O(3)CB exposure. In contrast, depressed HR responses occurred in B6 mice without detectable changes in HRV parameters.

These studies often considered other gaseous co-pollutants also as potential confounders, including nitrogen dioxide (NO2), sulfur dioxide (SO2), and carbon monoxide (CO). However, because each of these air pollutants can have different seasonal patterns and chemical interactions, the estimation and interpretation of each pollutant's individual risk estimates may not be straightforward. Multi-collinearity among the air pollution and weather variables also leaves the possibility of confounding and over- or under-fitting of meteorological variables, thereby potentially influencing the health effect estimates for the various pollutants in differing ways. To investigate these issues, we examined the temporal relationships among air pollution and weather variables in the context of air pollution health effects models. We compiled daily data for PM less than 2.5 mum (PM2.5), ozone, NO2, SO2, CO, temperature, dew point, relative humidity, wind speed, and barometric pressure for New York City for the years 1999-2002. We conducted several sets of analyses to characterize air pollution and weather data interactions, to assess different aspects of these data issues: (1) spatial/temporal variation of PM2.5 and gaseous pollutants measured at multiple monitors; (2) temporal relationships among air pollution and weather variables; and (3) extent and nature of multi-collinearity of air pollution and weather variables in the context of health effects models. The air pollution variables showed a varying extent of intercorrelations with each other and with weather variables, and these correlations also varied across seasons. For example, NO2 exhibited the strongest negative correlation with wind speed among the pollutants considered, while ozone's correlation with PM2.5 changed signs across the seasons (positive in summer and negative in winter). The extent of multi-collinearity problems also varied across pollutants and choice of health effects models commonly used in the literature. These results indicate that the health effects regression need to be run by season for some pollutants to provide the most meaningful results. We also find that model choice and interpretation needs to take into consideration the varying pollutant concurvities with the model co-variables in each pollutant's health effects model specification. Finally, we provide an example for analysis of associations between these air pollutants and asthma emergency department visits in New York City, which evaluate the relationship between the various pollutants' risk estimates and their respective concurvities, and discuss the limitations that these results imply about the interpretability of multi-pollutant health effects models.",6.2.7.1,Summary of Findings from 26 O3 AQCD,3.1.5.2,Emergency Department (ED) Visits

Prior findings about modifiers are inconsistent, and most of these studies were conducted in developed countries. OBJECTIVES: We conducted a time-series analysis to examine the modifying effect of season, sex, age, and education on the association between outdoor air pollutants [particulate matter < 10 microm in aerodynamic diameter (PM(10)), sulfur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide, and ozone] and daily mortality in Shanghai, China, using 4 years of daily data (2001-2004). METHODS: Using a natural spline model to analyze the data, we examined effects of air pollution for the warm season (April-September) and cool season (October-March) separately. For total mortality, we examined the association stratified by sex and age. Stratified analysis by educational attainment was conducted for total, cardiovascular, and respiratory mortality. RESULTS: Outdoor air pollution was associated with mortality from all causes and from cardiorespiratory diseases in Shanghai. An increase of 10 mug/m(3) in a 2-day average concentration of PM(10), SO(2), NO(2), and O(3) corresponds to increases in all-cause mortality of 0.25% [95% confidence interval (CI), 0.14-0.37), 0.95% (95% CI, 0.62-1.28), 0.97% (95% CI, 0.66-1.27), and 0.31% (95% CI, 0.04-0.58), respectively. The effects of air pollutants were more evident in the cool season than in the warm season, and females and the elderly were more vulnerable to outdoor air pollution.

A particular feature in the region is dust blown from the Sahara a few times a year resulting in extreme PM10 concentrations. It is not entirely clear whether such natural phenomena pose the same risks. METHODS: The effect of changes in daily levels of particulate matter (PM10) and ozone (O3) on hospitalization for all, cardiovascular and respiratory causes in the two hospitals in Nicosia during 1 January 1995 and 30 December 2004 was investigated using generalized additive Poisson models after controlling for long- and short-term patterns as well as for the effect of weather. Meteorological records were reviewed to identify dust-storm days and analyses were repeated to quantify their effect on cardio-respiratory morbidity. RESULTS: For every 10 microg/m3 increase in daily average PM10 concentrations, there was a 0.9% (95%CI: 0.6%, 1.2%) increase in all-cause and 1.2% (95%CI: -0.0%, 2.4%) increase in cardiovascular admissions. With respect to respiratory causes, an effect was observed only in the warm months. No lagged effects with levels of PM10 were observed. In contrast, positive associations with levels of ozone were only observed the two days prior to admission. These appeared stronger for cardiovascular causes and independent of the effect of PM. All-cause and cardiovascular admissions were 4.8% (95%CI: 0.7%, 9.0%) and 10.4% (95%CI: -4.7%, 27.9%) higher on dust storm days respectively. In both cases the magnitude of effect was comparable to that seen on the quartile of non-storm days with the highest levels of PM10. CONCLUSION: We observed an increased risk of hospitalization at elevated levels of particulate matter and ozone generally consistent with the magnitude seen across several European cities. We also observed an increased risk of hospitalization on dust storm days, particularly for cardiovascular causes.

This MiniReview (in conjunction with the May 2007 International Conference on Foetal Programming and Development Toxicity) highlights key methodological issues surrounding this research area, based on our experiences in Southern California. All 'criteria' air pollutants have been linked to birth outcomes. Our own studies found most consistent associations for carbon monoxide and particles. Traffic exhaust toxins are possible causative agents, but air monitoring data relied on by almost all existing studies inadequately capture their intracommunity variability in concentrations. Exposure assessment might be improved by biomarkers and land use-based regression modelling or information on time-activity patterns. Foetal development provides unique opportunities to study exposures acting during narrow susceptibility windows. A time-series approach by design controls for confounders that do not vary temporally but can only address short-term acute effects. Studies employing spatial or medium-term (trimester-specific) temporal contrasts may be more susceptible to residual confounding, and studies adjusting only for risk factors recorded on birth certificates have been criticized. Findings from our recent study in Southern California indicate that air pollution effect estimates are not markedly influenced by risk factors not provided on birth certificates. Yet, studies collecting detailed risk factor information in other geographic regions may be needed to further evaluate the extent of residual confounding in record-based analyses.

Black cherry branch elongation and milkweed growth and pod formation were significantly higher west of Lake Michigan while ozone injury was greater east of Lake Michigan. Using classification and regression tree (CART) analyses we determined that departures from normal precipitation, soil nitrogen and ozone exposure/peak hourly concentrations were the most important variables affecting cherry branch elongation, and milkweed stem height and pod formation.

OBJECTIVE: We evaluated the use of exhaled breath condensate (EBC) malondialdehyde as a biomarker of exposure to traffic-related pollution in children with asthma as part of a panel study in Mexico City.

METHODS: Standard spirometry and collection of EBC and nasal lavage were performed. Environmental monitoring sites were located within 5 km of the children's homes and schools. Data were analyzed by using generalized estimating equations.

RESULTS: A total of 480 samples of malondialdehyde were obtained from 107 patients with asthma, with a median level of 18.7 (interquartile range [IQR], 12.4-28.7) nmol. Ambient particulates less than 2.5 microg/m(3) and ozone levels on the day of sampling were significantly associated with higher malondialdehyde levels. A 14.2-microg/m(3) (IQR) increase in 8-hour moving average particulates less than 2.5 microg/m(3) in size was associated with a 1.12-nmol increase in malondialdehyde and a 15.9-ppb (IQR) increase in 8-hour moving average ozone with a 1.16-nmol increase in malondialdehyde. Malondialdehyde levels were inversely associated with forced vital capacity and FEV(1) and positively associated with IL-8 levels in nasal lavage.

Methods:We conducted a secondary analysis of the Neurobehavioral Evaluation System-2 (NES2) data (including a simple reaction time test [SRTT] measuring motor response speed to a visual stimulus; a symbol-digit substitution test [SDST] for coding ability; and a serial-digit learning test [SDLT] for attention and short-term memory) from 1764 adult participants (aged 37.5 ? 10.9 years) of the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey in 1988?1991. Based on ambient PM10 (PM with aerodynamic diameter <10 ?m) and ozone data from the EPA Aerometric Information Retrieval System database, estimated annual exposure prior to the examination were aggregated at the centroid of each census-block group of geocoded residences, using distance-weighted averages from all monitors in the residing and adjoining counties. Generalized linear models were constructed to examine the associations, adjusting for potential confounders.
Results:In age- and sex-adjusted models, PM10 predicted reduced CNS functions, but the association disappeared after adjustment for sociodemographic factors.

photosynthesis down-regulates and with it, gs. The relationship between gs and photosynthesis may not be constant because stomata
respond more slowly to environmental changes than photosynthesis, and because elevated CO2 may alter guard cell sensitivity to other signals. Also, reduced stomatal density (and gs) in response to long-term CO2 enrichment suggests sustained reduction in gs.

Methods: Thirty-one subjects with CHF participated in this study in 2002 and 2003. Over a 2-month period, the investigators measured their oxygen saturation, pulse rate, weight and temperature each morning and recorded these and other data in a daily diary. Air pollution and weather conditions were obtained from fixed-site monitoring stations. The study made use of mixed regression models, adjusting for within-subject serial correlation and temporal trends, to determine the association between oxygen saturation and pulse rate and personal and environmental variables. Depending on the model, we accounted for the effects of a variety of personal variables (eg, body temperature, salt consumption) as well as nitrogen dioxide (NO2), ozone, maximum temperature and change in barometric pressure at 8:00 from the previous day.

Results: In multivariable analyses, the study found that oxygen saturation was reduced when subjects reported that they were ill, consumed salt, or drank liquids on the previous day and had higher body temperatures on the concurrent day (only the latter was statistically significant). Relative humidity and decreased atmospheric pressure from the previous day were associated with oxygen saturation. In univariate analyses, there was negative associations with concentrations of fine particulates, ozone, and sulphur dioxide (SO2), but only SO2 was significant after adjustment for the effects of weather. For pulse rate, no associations were found for the personal variables and in univariate analyses the study found positive associations with NO2, fine particulates (aerodynamic diameter of 2.5 ?m or under, PM2.5), SO2, and maximum temperature, although only the latter two were significant after adjustment for environmental effects.

The largest reductions in carbon storage for the period 1950?1995, 41%, occur in eastern Europe.

growth in the country. Here, we assess the field gas exchange, growth and development, and  
allocation responses underlying the observed growth differences and compare them with isolated  
O-3 responses documented in the open-top chamber experiment. Cottonwoods showed no visible foliar  
injury, reduced photosynthesis of recently expanded foliage, early leaf senescence, protective  
reduction in stomatal conductance, or compensatory allocation to shoot relative to root biomass

significantly higher conductance and reduced photosynthesis of older foliage that led to reduced  
leaf area production and a twofold biomass reduction in the absence of visible injury. Rural- 
grown field plants showed the same pattern of significantly higher conductance in the absence of  
concomitant increases in photosynthesis that was indicative of a loss of stomatal control.  
Incremental changes in foliar production were also significantly inversely related to  
fluctuations in ambient O-3 exposures. The similarity in biomass, gas exchange, phenological, and  
allocation responses between chamber and field experiments indicate that mechanisms accounting  
for reduced growth at rural sites were consistent with those in the open-top chamber O-3

relationship of increased conductance with lower photosynthesis of older foliage that was

The trees exhibited a significant decrease in needle photosynthetic rates proportional to the cumulative ozone exposure, decreasing by 50% after 350m.h (12-h summation). This decrease was correlated with a parallel decline in Rubisco activity. In contrast, increases in the activities of several enzymes linked to the degradative pathways of sugars were observed. The largest increase was observed in the activity of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (65% for 300ppm.h). However, this marked increase and the slighter increases in phosphofructokinase and fumarase activities (about 25%) showed a tendency to a further decline when the trees were exposed to higher cumulative ozone doses.

Changes in gene expression were compared with lung tissue histopathology, morphometry, and biochemical and cellular parameters in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF). Ova challenge was responsible for the preponderance of gene expression changes, related largely to inflammation. CAPs exposure alone resulted in no significant gene expression changes, but CAPs and ova-exposed rodents exhibited an enhanced effect relative to ova alone with differentially expressed genes primarily related to inflammation and airway remodeling. Gene expression data was consistent with the biochemical and cellular analyses of the BALF, the pulmonary pathology, and morphometric changes when comparing the CAPs-ova group to the air-saline or CAPs-saline group. However, the gene expression data were more sensitive than the BALF cell type and number for assessing the effects of CAPs and ova versus the ova challenge alone. In addition, the gene expression results provided some additional insight into the TGF-beta-mediated molecular processes underlying these changes.

Since the lungs are directly exposed to very high amounts of oxygen, it is imperative for the organ to possess defences against possible oxidative challenge. The lungs are therefore endowed with an armamentarium of a battery of endogenous agents called antioxidants. The antioxidant species help the lungs ward off the deleterious consequences of a wide variety of oxidants/reactive oxygen species such as superoxide anion, hydroxyl radical, hypohalite radical, hydrogen peroxide and reactive nitrogen species such as nitric oxide, peroxynitrite, nitrite produced endogenously and sometimes accessed through exposure to the environment. The major non-enzymatic antioxidants of the lungs are glutathione, vitamins C and E, beta-carotene, uric acid and the enzymatic antioxidants are superoxide dismutases, catalase and peroxidases. These antioxidants are the first lines of defence against the oxidants and usually act at a gross level. Recent insights into cellular redox chemistry have revealed the presence of certain specialized proteins such as peroxiredoxins, thioredoxins, glutaredoxins, heme oxygenases and reductases, which are involved in cellular adaptation and protection against an oxidative assault. These molecules usually exert their action at a more subtle level of cellular signaling processes.

We examined the signal transduction events that lead to activation of defense mechanisms in poplar, a major forest species of economic and ecological importance which is becoming the model tree system for studying stress and adaptation responses. We show that, in poplar cell suspensions and leaf tissue, chitosan, a non-host-specific elicitor, and ozone, a strong oxidant and atmospheric pollutant, induce rapid and transient activation of at least two myelin basic protein (MBP) kinases with apparent molecular masses of 44 and 47 kD. The chitosan- and ozone-activated kinases have characteristics of MAPKs: they preferentially phosphorylate MBP, require tyrosine and threonine phosphorylation to be activated and are specifically recognized by anti-ERK and anti-pERK antibodies. Moreover, activation of these poplar MAPKs by chitosan or ozone is dependent on the production of reactive oxygen species; the influx of calcium ions via membrane channels; the activation of an upstream, membrane-localized component; and a cognate MAPK kinase (MAPKK).

Parameters of chlorophyll a fluorescence, pigments content and antioxidant enzyme activity were measured in control and ozone-treated plants and the data obtained from these analyses was used to perform multivariate statistics. The results indicated that the treatment with ozone and the species diversity, as well as the interaction between the two factors, were able to significantly affect the variables as a whole. Ozone treatment affected plant metabolism to different extents for the different species, even if the statistical analyses performed proved that most of them could be grouped in two main clusters. The first cluster is mainly affected in the photosynthetic performance, as indicated by the decrease in the F-v/F-m ratio and the increase in the de-epoxidation index, while the second one grouped species characterised by strong reductions in leaf pigment content and by increases in peroxidase activity. The observation that most of the parameters analysed were differently affected by the treatment in the natural and semi-natural species investigated pointed out that the different constitutive metabolic behaviour could account for a different susceptibility to the pollutant and, as a consequence, for a different performance of some of the species in heavily polluted environments.

To determine if a given AQS protected against adverse effects on vegetation, hourly ozone concentrations were adjusted to create exposure levels that ""just attain"" a given standard. These exposures were used in combination with a physiologically-based tree growth model to account for the interactions of climate and ozone. In the evaluation, we used ozone concentrations from two 6-year time periods from the San Bernardino Mountains in California. There were clear differences in the level of vegetation protection achieved with the various AQSs. Based on modeled plant growth, the most effective standards were the California 8-hr average maximum of 70 ppb and a seasonal, cumulative, concentration-weighted index (SUM06), which if attained, resulted in annual growth reductions of 1 % or less. Least effective was the 1-hr maximum of 120 ppb which resulted in a 7% annual reduction.

Presently, it is uncertain how increasing atmospheric CO2 and O-3 will alter plant N demand and the acquisition of soil N by plants as well as the microbial supply of N from soil organic matter. To address this uncertainty, we initiated an ecosystem-level N-15 tracer experiment at the Rhinelander (Wisconsin, USA) free air CO2-O-3 enrichment (FACE) facility to understand how projected increases in atmospheric CO2 and O-3 alter the distribution and flow of N in developing northern temperate forests. Tracer amounts of (NH4+)-N-15 were applied to the forest floor of developing Populus tremuloides and P. tremuloides - Betula papyrifera communities that have been exposed to factorial CO2 and O-3 treatments for seven years. One year after isotope addition, both forest communities exposed to elevated CO2 obtained greater amounts of N-15 (29%) and N (40%) from soil, despite no change in soil N availability or plant N-use efficiency. As such, elevated CO2 increased the ability of plants to exploit soil for N, through the development of a larger root system. Conversely, elevated O-3 decreased the amount of N-15 (-15%) and N (-29%) in both communities, a response resulting from lower rates of photosynthesis, decreases in growth, and smaller root systems that acquired less soil N. Neither CO2 nor O-3 altered the amount of N or N-15 recovery in the forest floor, microbial biomass, or soil organic matter. Moreover, we observed no interaction between CO2 and O-3 on the amount of N or N-15 in any ecosystem pool, suggesting that O-3 could exert a negative effect regardless of CO2 concentration. In a CO2-enriched atmosphere, greater belowground growth and a more thorough exploitation of soil for growth-limiting N is an important mechanism sustaining the enhancement of NPP in developing forests (0-8 years following establishment). However, as CO2 accumulates in the Earth's atmosphere, future O-3 concentrations threaten to diminish the enhancement of plant growth, decrease plant N acquisition, and lessen the storage of anthropogenic C in temperate forests.",9.4.3.1,Plant Growth and Biomass Allocation,0,0

Net photosynthesis was enhanced 49-73% by elevated [CO2], and decreased 13-30% by elevated [O-3]. Elevated [CO2] delayed, and elevated [O-3] tended to accelerate, leaf abscission in autumn. Elevated [CO2] increased the ratio of monosaccharides to di- and oligosaccharides in aspen buds, which may indicate a lag in cold acclimation. The total carbon concentration in overwintering buds was unaffected by the treatments, although elevated [O-3] decreased the amount of starch by 16% in birch buds, and reduced the size of aspen buds, which may be related to the delayed leaf development in aspen during the spring. Elevated [CO2] generally ameliorated the effects of elevated [O-3]. Our results show that both elevated [CO2] and elevated [O-3] have the potential to alter carbon metabolism of overwintering buds.

Substantial changes in the abundance of 42 transcripts were recorded in response to the treatments, and 6 transcript clusters were observed. The abundance of 37 mRNAs was increased more then 1.5-fold, whereas that of 5 mRNAs was reduced. The abundances of 5, 6 and 9 mRNAs were specifically increased by short-term mercury application, ozone fumigation, and long-term mercuric-ion exposure, respectively. The transcription of the other 5 transcripts was induced by both ozone and short-term mercuric-ion treatment. The abundance of 10 different mRNAs was increased by the different mercuric-ion applications. Two transcripts were induced by ozone fumigation, as well as long-term, mercury treatment. Finally, 5 transcripts were repressed by ozone exposure, and 3 out of them by short-term mercuric-ion treatment. These results show that the array technique can be used to analyse the expression pattern in Arabidopsis thaliana under ozone and mercuric-ion stress.

Regarding the 5(th) leaf, +40 atmosphere induced a loss in pigmentation, PEPc and Rubisco activase mRNAs. However, it was unable to notably depress carboxylase protein amounts and mRNAs encoding Rubisco. Except for Rubisco mRNAs, all other measured parameters from 5(th) leaf were depressed by +80 atmosphere. Regarding the loth leaf, +40 atmosphere increased photosynthetic pigments and transcripts encoding Rubisco and Rubisco activase. Rubisco and PEPc protein amounts were not drastically changed, even if they tended to be increased. Level of C-4-PEPc mRNA remained almost stable. In response to +80 atmosphere, pigments and transcripts encoding PEPc were notably decreased. Rubisco and PEPc protein amounts also declined to a lesser extent.

The main difference between previous studies and our approach was that previous studies were performed on seedlings in pot experiments or in closed or open top chambers, and not in situ, in a mature forest stand. Although beech is a relatively unresponsive species to tropospheric O-3, we found a pronounced effect of 2 x O-3 on the number of vital ectomycorrhizal root tips and non-turgescent fine roots. Both categories of roots were significantly increased when compared to controls in two consecutive years at each sampling event. The number of types of ectomycorrhizae and species richness increased in 2004, but not in the extremely dry year 2003.

Moreover, the hypothesis was tested whether properties of the root system in strawberry were involved in ozone tolerance, for example, the roots' ability to store or make available carbohydrates and their capacity to secure plants' supply with nitrogen during a stress situation. In strawberry, ozone reduced leaf area by reducing leaf number. Moreover, specific leaf area (SLA) and relative leaf water content were reduced. Net photosynthesis was only slightly impaired, but activity of Rubisco and chlorophyll content in older leaves of cv. `Elsanta' were significantly reduced. The most important, indirect impairment of photosynthesis was the reduction of plants' total leaf area, which resulted in a decrease in plant biomass. The reduction of root biomass, the root/shoot ratio, and also the distribution of carbohydrates indicated a partitioning priority of the shoot at expense of the root system. Cultivar `Elsanta' was characterized by significantly lower carbohydrate levels in ozone-exposed leaves, whereas levels remained fairly stable in `Korona' leaves. In addition, nitrogen concentrations in leaves and roots decreased significantly in `Elsanta', not in `Korona'.

Plant injury index (i.e. a combination of percentage of injured leaves and leaf surface affected) was more consistently related with physiological measurements than the onset of first symptom of visible injury.

We suggest that in enriched CO2 habitats, increased shading from rapidly growing trees offsets the positive benefits of CO2 for understory plant performance. Enriched CO2 and O-3 atmospheres may have large direct and indirect effects on colonization, establishment, and performance of common understory plants. Such changes may in turn alter forest community and ecosystem dynamics. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",9.4.3.1,Plant Growth and Biomass Allocation,0,0

Gas exchanges and histo-anatomical parameters were measured to specifically understand whether ozone indirectly affects the anatomy and physiology of leaves. Three leaf classes were investigated: (1) those expanding above the cuvettes (A leaves); (2) those already developed inside the cuvettes (B leaves) and (3) those developing inside the cuvettes, since the beginning of the ozone treatment (C leaves). The anatomy and morphology of the first leaf developing outside the cuvette (A1) were strongly affected by ozone, whereas photosynthesis was not perturbed. However, in leaves of ozone-treated plants developing after A1, a large reduction of starch accumulation was observed, which suggests a delayed biosynthesis, or a very rapid export of starch toward other sinks. Isoprene emission was higher and isoprene synthase messenger RNA was more expressed in ozone- treated A1 leaves than in control leaves with similar ontogeny. This indicates that isoprene synthesis is stimulated by ozone, and reveals that isoprene emission is controlled at a transcriptional level. Leaves already developed inside the cuvette (B leaves) rapidly sensed ozone stress, which inhibited photosynthesis, stomatal conductance and isoprene emission. The observation that new leaves were developing inside the cuvettes during the treatment (C leaves) suggests that resistance to ozone may be acquired by plants. Leaves C showed a more packed and thinner mesophyll than controls of similar development, which may help reduce ozone penetration inside cells. They also showed a lower photosynthesis in comparison to controls and to other leaf classes, probably because of ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/ oxygenase activity limitation, as inferred from photosynthesis response to intercellular CO2. However, isoprene emission was slightly stimulated also in C leaves, confirming that a large fraction of carbon is invested into isoprene formation under ozone stress.",9.3.5.3,Secondary Metabolism,0,0

At the same time, photosynthetic pigments as well as carboxylase (PEPc and Rubisco) activities and amounts were also examined in the 5th leaf. Ozone enhanced visible symptoms characterizing foliar senescence. Across NF, +20, +40, and +60 atmospheres, both chlorophylls and carotenoids were found to be linearly decreased against increasing AOT40 (ca. -50% in +60). No supplementary decrease was observed between +60 and +80. Total above-ground biomass was reduced by 26% in +80 atmosphere; leaf dry matter being more depressed by ozone than leaf area. In some cases, LMA index was consistent to reflect low negative effects caused by a moderate increase in ozone concentration. PEPc and Rubisco were less sensitive to ozone than pigments: only the two highest external ozone doses reduced their activities by about 20-30%. These changes might be connected to losses in PEPc and Rubisco proteins that were decreased by about one-third. The underlying mechanisms for these results were discussed with special reference to C-3 species.

A new version of the Terrestrial Ecosystem Model (TEM-Hydro) was developed to examine the effects of carbon and nitrogen on the water cycle. We used two climate models (NCAR CCSM3 and DOE PCM) and two emissions scenarios (SRES B1 and A2) to examine the effects of climate, elevated CO2, nitrogen limitation, and ozone exposure on the hydrological cycle in the eastern United States. While the direction of future runoff changes is largely dependent upon predicted precipitation changes, the effects of elevated CO2 on ecosystem function (stomatal closure and CO2 fertilization) increase runoff by 3-7%, as compared to the effects of climate alone.

Scenarios for the year 2100 included elevated [CO2] and [O-3] (+385 ppm and +20 ppb, respectively), warming (+4 degrees C), and increased winter precipitation (+20% November-March). Simulations were run with and without adjustments for experimentally observed physiological and biomass adjustments. Initial simplistic model runs for single-factor changes in CO2 and temperature predicted substantial increases (+191% or 508 g C m(-2) yr(-1)) or decreases (-206% or -549 g C m(-2) yr(-1)), respectively, in mean annual net ecosystem carbon exchange (NEE(a)approximate to 266 +/- 23 g C m(-2) yr(-1) from 1993 to 2003). Conversely, single-factor changes in precipitation or O-3 had comparatively small effects on NEEa (0% and -35%, respectively). The combined influence of all four environmental changes yielded a 29% reduction in mean annual NEEa. These results suggested that future CO2-induced enhancements of gross photosynthesis would be largely offset by temperature-induced increases in respiration, exacerbation of water deficits, and O-3-induced reductions in photosynthesis. However, when experimentally observed physiological adjustments were included in the simulations (e.g. acclimation of leaf respiration to warming), the combined influence of the year 2100 scenario resulted in a 20% increase in NEEa not a decrease. Consistent with the annual model's predictions, simulations with a forest succession model run for gradually changing conditions from 2000 to 2100 indicated an 11% increase in stand wood biomass in the future compared with current conditions.

Plants overexpressing dehydroascorbate reductase (DHAR), which results in an increase in the endogenous level of Asc, were exposed to acute or chronic levels of ozone. DHAR-overexpressing plants had a lower oxidative load, a lower level of oxidative-related enzyme activities, a higher level of chlorophyll, and a higher level of photosynthetic activity 24 h following an acute exposure (2 h) to 200 ppb ozone than control plants, despite exhibiting a larger stomatal area. Reducing the size of the Asc pool size through suppression of DHAR expression had the opposite effect. Following a chronic exposure (30 d) to 100 ppb ozone, plants with a larger Asc pool size maintained a larger stomatal area and a higher oxidative load, but retained a higher level of photosynthetic activity than control plants, whereas plants suppressed for DHAR had a substantially reduced stomatal area, but also a substantially lower level of photosynthetic activity.

Emission of the related monoterpenes is more universal among plants, but the amount of isoprene emitted from plants dominates the biosphere-atmosphere hydrocarbon exchange. Scope The emission of isoprene from plants affects atmospheric chemistry. Isoprene reacts very rapidly with hydroxyl radicals in the atmosphere making hydroperoxides that can enhance ozone formation. Aerosol formation in the atmosphere may also be influenced by biogenic isoprene. Plants that emit isoprene are better able to tolerate sunlight-induced rapid heating of leaves (heat flecks). They also tolerate ozone and other reactive oxygen species better than non-emitting plants. Expression of the isoprene synthase gene can account for control of isoprene emission capacity as leaves expand. The emission capacity of fully expanded leaves varies through the season but the biochemical control of capacity of mature leaves appears to be at several different points in isoprene metabolism. Conclusions The capacity for isoprene emission evolved many times in plants, probably as a mechanism for coping with heat flecks. It also confers tolerance of reactive oxygen species. It is an example of isoprenoids enhancing membrane function, although the mechanism is likely to be different from that of sterols.

Thermotolerance of photosynthesis against transient high-temperature episodes could only be observed in lines emitting high levels of isoprene; the effect was very mild and could only be identified over repetitive stress events. However, isoprene-emitting plants were highly resistant to ozone-induced oxidative damage compared with their non-emitting azygous controls. In ozone-treated plants, accumulation of toxic reactive oxygen species (ROS) was inhibited, and antioxidant levels were higher. Isoprene-emitting plants showed remarkably decreased foliar damage and higher rates of photosynthesis compared to non-emitting plants immediately following oxidative stress events. An inhibition of hydrogen peroxide accumulation in isoprene-emitting plants may stall the programmed cell death response which would otherwise lead to foliar necrosis.

We have used ozone (O-3) as a tool to elicit ROS-activated stress responses, and to activate cell death in plant leaves. Here, we have investigated the roles and interactions of ROS and NO in the induction and regulation of O-3-induced cell death. Treatment with O-3 induced a rapid accumulation of NO, which started from guard cells, spread to adjacent epidermal cells and eventually moved to mesophyll cells. During the later time points, NO production coincided with the formation of hypersensitive response (HR)-like lesions. The NO donor sodium nitroprusside (SNP) and O-3 individually induced a large set of defence-related genes; however, in a combined treatment SNP attenuated the O-3 induction of salicylic acid (SA) biosynthesis and other defence-related genes.

Following insertion of the plant, the plate forms air-tight bottom surface of the cuvette; thus the rosette is enclosed without touching it during any phase of the insertion of the plant to the cuvette. The device allows monitoring rapid responses in the stomatal function. For example, an acute exposure to 150 ppb O-3 decreased stomatal conductance to 60-70% of its initial value within 9-12 min. Thereafter, the conductance regained its preexposure value within further 30-40 min in spite of the continuing O-3 exposure. The transient decrease was absent in the abscisic acid-insensitive mutant abi2 defective in a class 2C protein phosphatase. This provides an in vivo confirmation that the early transient decrease in stomatal conductance is not a result of physical damage by the reactive oxygen species (ROS) formed from O-3 breakdown but reflects the biological action of ROS, transduced through a signalling cascade.

An investigation to determine whether the differential sensitivity of two white clover clones (Trifolium repens L. cv Regal) to O-3 was related with their levels of ASC, glutathione derivatives or with the total antioxidative capacity. In contrast to what might be expected, the sensitive clone of white clover (NC-S) constitutively showed a 72% higher concentration of apoplastic ASC compared to the O-3-tolerant clone (NC-R). Furthermore, NC-S also showed a higher redox status of apoplastic ASC. These results indicate that higher ASC levels in the apoplast of NC-S are not sufficient to induce a higher O-3 tolerance. The redox status, but not the absolute concentration of homoglutathione in the symplast was found to be constitutively higher in NC-R than in NC-S. It is not clear, however, whether homoglutathione is a direct cause of the differential O-3 detoxification capacity of both clones. Total antioxidative capacity measurements ruled out the contribution of other low-molecular antioxidants to the relative tolerance of NC-R.

Incorporation of the transgene in the genome of tobacco plants was confirmed by PCR and Southern-blot analysis and its expression was confirmed by Northern- and Western-blot analyses. These transgenic plants exhibited up to 2.1-fold higher MDAR activity and 2.2-fold higher level of reduced AsA compared to non-transformed control plants. The transgenic plants showed enhanced stress tolerance in term of significantly higher net photosynthesis rates under ozone, salt and polyethylene glycol (PEG) stresses and greater PSII effective quantum yield under ozone and salt stresses.

The most potentially deleterious effect of ROS under most conditions is that at high concentrations they trigger genetically programmed cell suicide events. Moreover, because plants use ROS as second messengers in signal transduction cascades in processes as diverse as mitosis, tropisms and cell death, their accumulation is crucial to plant development as well as defence. Direct ROS signal transduction will ensue only if ROS escape destruction by antioxidants or are otherwise consumed in a ROS cascade. Thus, the major low molecular weight antioxidants determine the specificity of the signal. They are also themselves signal-transducing molecules that can either signal independently or further transmit ROS signals. The moment has come to re-evaluate the concept of oxidative stress. In contrast to this pejorative or negative term, implying a state to be avoided, we propose that the syndrome would be more usefully described as 'oxidative signalling', that is, an important and critical function associated with the mechanisms by which plant cells sense the environment and make appropriate adjustments to gene expression, metabolism and physiology.",9.3.3.1,Ozone Signal Transduction,0,0

Various approaches used to evaluate O-3 effects generally concur that current yield losses range from 5% to 15% among sensitive plants. There is, however, considerable genetic variability in plant responses to O-3. To illustrate this, we show that ambient O-3 concentrations in the eastern United States cause substantially different levels of damage to otherwise similar snap bean cultivars. Largely undesirable effects of O-3 can also occur in seed and fruit chemistry as well as in forage nutritive value, with consequences for animal production. Ozone may alter herbicide efficacy and foster establishment of some invasive species. We conclude that current and projected levels of O-3 in many regions worldwide are toxic to sensitive plants of agricultural and horticultural significance.

Specific cDNA-fragments of the corresponding six genes were isolated from tobacco Bel W3 and used as probes for determining the expression of the prechorismate pathway genes. The fully expanded leaves of ozone treated plants, which developed symptoms like necrotic leaf spots and accumulation of aromatic metabolites, showed a clear induction of the shikimate pathway genes; indicating, that this induction is linked to the development of the symptoms. Distinct kinetics and magnitudes were observed in tobacco leaves for the ozone dependent enhanced mRNA accumulation of the aforementioned genes in BelW3. The strongest and earliest induction due to ozone treatment could be observed for DAHP synthase. An isoform-specific analysis of the transcripts showed a strong induction on transcript level only for one of three isoforms, which was followed by the induction of the DAHP synthase also on protein level.

We will also turn to other types of abiotic stresses, less studied in relation to polyamine metabolism, such as mineral deficiencies, chilling, wounding, heavy metals, UV, ozone and paraquat, where polyamine metabolism is also modified. There is a great amount of data demonstrating that under many types of abiotic stresses, an accumulation of the three main polyamines putrescine, spermidine and spermine does occur. However, there are still many doubts concerning the role that polyamines play in stress tolerance. Several environmental challenges (osmotic stress, salinity, ozone, UV) are shown to induce ADC activity more than ODC. The rise in Put is mainly attributed to the increase in ADC activity as a consequence of the activation of ADC genes and their mRNA levels. On the other hand, free radicals are now accepted as important mediators of tissue injury and cell death. The polycationic nature of polyamines, positively charged at physiological pH, has attracted the attention of researchers and has led to the hypothesis that polyamines could affect physiological systems by binding to anionic sites, such as those associated with nucleic acids and membrane phospholipids.

Current ambient [O-3] (40 ppb on average) significantly reduced the total biomass of trees by 7% compared with trees grown in charcoal-filtered (CF) controls, which approximate preindustrial [O-3].

The root-to-shoot ratio was significantly reduced by elevated [O-3] indicating greater sensitivity of root biomass to [O-3]. At elevated [O-3], trees had significant reductions in leaf area, Rubisco content and chlorophyll content which may underlie significant reductions in photosynthetic capacity. Trees also had lower transpiration rates, and were shorter in height and had reduced diameter when grown at elevated [O-3]. Further, at elevated [O-3], gymnosperms were significantly less sensitive than angiosperms.

In pathogen-infected leaves, SA is synthesized via two pathways, involving phenylalanine or isochorismate. SA biosynthesis under O-3 fumigation is not well understood. When we applied C-14-labeled benzoic acid (a precursor of SA in the pathway via phenylalanine) to O-3-exposed tobacco leaves, it was effectively metabolized to SA. However, the activity and mRNA level of isochorismate synthase (ICS) were not increased. In contrast, ICS activity was increased in O-3-exposed Arabidopsis thaliana L. These results suggest that SA is synthesized via benzoic acid from phenylalanine in O-3-exposed tobacco leaves but via isochorismate in Arabidopsis. Ethylene is a plant hormone that promotes leaf damage in O-3-exposed plants. During O-3 exposure, transgenic plants with a phenotype of reduced O-3-induced ethylene production accumulated less SA than did wild-type plants. O-3 increased the activity of phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL) and the transcript levels of the chorismate mutase (CM) and PAL genes in wild-type tobacco, but their induction was suppressed in the transgenic plants. These results indicate that ethylene promotes SA accumulation by regulating the expression of the CM and PAL genes in O-3-exposed tobacco.",9.3.3.3,Role of Phytohormones in Plant Response to Ozone,0,0

Plants were classified as either ozone-sensitive or insensitive based on the amount of foliar injury. Sensitive plants developed injury earlier in the season and to a greater extent than insensitive plants. Older leaf cohorts were more likely to belong to high injury classes by the end of each of the two growing seasons. In addition, leaf loss was more likely for older cohorts (2000) and lower leaf positions (2001) than younger cohorts and upper leaves, respectively. Most leaves abscised without prior ozone-like stippling or chlorosis. Failure to take this into account can result in underestimation of the effects of ozone on these plants. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

To understand whether this could be the result of a direct scavenging of ozone by these molecules, the stomatal and non-stomatal uptake of ozone was estimated in plants emitting isoprene or monoterpenes. Ozone uptake by holm oak (Quercus ilex, a monoterpene emitter) and black poplar (Populus nigra, an isoprene emitter) was studied in whole plant enclosures (continuously stirred tank reactors, CSTR). The ozone uptake by plants was estimated measuring ozone concentration at the inlet and outlet of the reactors, after correcting for the uptake of the enclosure materials. Destruction of ozone at the cuticle or at the plant stems was found to be negligible compared to the ozone uptake through the stomata. For both plant species, a relationship between stomatal conductance and ozone uptake was found. For the poplar, the measured ozone losses were explained by the uptake of ozone through the stomata only, and ozone destruction by gas phase reactions with isoprene was negligible. For the oak, gas phase reactions of ozone with the monoterpenes emitted by the plants contributed significantly to ozone destruction. This was confirmed by two different experiments showing a) that in cases of high stomatal conductance but under low CO2 concentration, a reduction of monoterpene emission was still associated with reduced O-3 uptake; and b) that ozone losses due to the gas phase reactions only can be measured when using the exhaust from a plant chamber to determine the gas phase reactivity in an empty reaction chamber.

A meta-analytic review of the last 3 decades of experiments,"Wittig, VE; Ainsworth, EA; Long, SP",2007,"The surface concentration of ozone ([031) has risen from less than 10 ppb prior to the industrial revolution to a daytime mean concentration of approximately 40 ppb over much of the northern temperate zone. If current global emission trends continue, surface [031 is projected to rise a further 50% over this century, with larger increases in many locations including Northern Hemisphere forests. This review uses statistical meta-analysis to determine mean effects, and their confidence limits, of both the current and projected elevations Of [031 on light-saturated photosynthetic CO2 uptake (As,) and stomatal conductance (gs) in trees. In total, 348 measurements of As., from 61 studies and 266 measures of gs from 55 studies were reviewed. Results suggested that the elevation Of [031 that has occurred since the industrial revolution is depressing As., and gs by 11% (CI 9-13%) and 13% (CI 11-15%), respectively, where CI is the 95% confidence interval. In contrast to angiosperms, gymnosperms were not significantly affected. Both drought and elevated [CO2] significantly decreased the effect of ambient [O-3]. Younger trees (<4 years) were affected less than older trees. Elevation Of [03] above current levels caused progressively larger losses of As, and gs, including gymnosperms. Results are consistent with the expectation that damage to photosynthesis depends on the cumulative uptake of ozone (03) into the leaf. Thus, factors that lower gs lessen damage. Where both g, and [03] were recorded, an overall decline in A(sat) of 0.21% per mmol m(-2) of estimated cumulative 03 uptake was calculated. These findings suggest that rising [031, an often overlooked aspect of global atmospheric change, is progressively depressing the ability of temperate and boreal forests to assimilate carbon and transfer water vapour to the atmosphere, with significant potential effects on terrestrial carbon sinks and regional hydrologies.",9.3.2.1,Changes in Stomatal Function,8.3,Plant Growth

In sensitive plant species even a few hours of exposure to this potent oxidant (200-300 nL. L-1) leads to severe oxidative stress that manifests as visible cell death. In resistant plants usually no visible symptoms are observed on exposure to similar ozone concentrations. Naturally occurring variability to acute ozone in plants provides a valuable resource for examining molecular basis of the differences in responses to ozone. From our earlier study in Medicago truncatula, we have identified cultivar Jemalong is ozone sensitive and PI 464815 (JE154) is an ozone-resistant accession. Analyses of transcriptome changes in ozone-sensitive and resistant accession will provide important clues for understanding the molecular changes governing the plant responses to ozone. Results: Acute ozone treatment (300 nL L-1 for six hours) led to a reactive oxygen species (ROS) burst in sensitive Jemalong six hours post-fumigation. In resistant JE154 increase in ROS levels was much reduced compared to Jemalong. Based on the results of ROS profiling, time points for microarray analysis were one hour into the ozone treatment, end of treatment and onset of an ozone-induced ROS burst at 12 hours. Replicated temporal transcriptome analysis in these two accessions using 17 K oligonucleotide arrays revealed more than 2000 genes were differentially expressed. Significantly enriched gene ontologies (GOs) were identified using the Cluster Enrichment analysis program. A striking finding was the alacrity of JE154 in altering its gene expression patterns in response to ozone, in stark contrast to delayed transcriptional response of Jemalong. GOs involved in signaling, hormonal pathways, antioxidants and secondary metabolism were altered in both accessions. However, the repertoire of genes responding in each of these categories was different between the two accessions. Real-time PCR analysis confirmed the differential expression patterns of a subset of these genes. Conclusion: This study provided a cogent view of the unique and shared transcriptional responses in an ozone-resistant and sensitive accession that exemplifies the complexity of oxidative signaling in plants. Based on this study, and supporting literature in Arabidopsis we speculate that plants sensitive to acute ozone are impaired in perception of the initial signals generated by the action of this oxidant. This in turn leads to a delayed transcriptional response in the ozone sensitive plants. In resistant plants rapid and sustained activation of several signaling pathways enables the deployment of multiple mechanisms for minimizing the toxicity effect of this reactive molecule.",9.3.3.2,Gene and Protein Expression Changes in Response to Ozone,0,0

Our objective was to document the effects of elevated atmospheric CO2 and O-3 on understory species composition and biomass and to quantify nitrogen (N) acquisition by the understory vegetation. The research took place at the aspen free-air CO2 and O-3 enrichment (FACE) experiment, which has four treatments (control, elevated CO2, elevated O-3, and elevated CO2+O-3) and three tree communities: aspen, aspen/birch, and aspen/maple. In June 2003, each FACE ring was uniformly labeled with 15N applied as NH4Cl. Understory biomass was harvested in June of 2004 for productivity, N, and 15N measurements, and photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) was measured below the canopy. The understory was divided into five species groups, which dominate in this young aggrading forest: Taraxacum officinale (dandelion), Solidago sp. (goldenrod), Trifolium repens and T. pretense (clover), various species from the Poaceae family (grass), and composited minor components (CMC). Understory species composition, total and individual species biomass, N content, and 15N recovery showed overstory community effects, but the direct effects of treatments was masked by the high variability of these data. Total understory biomass increased with increasing light, and thus was greatest under the open canopy of the aspen/maple community, as well as the more open canopy of the elevated O-3 treatments. Species were different from one another in terms of 15N recovery, with virtually no 15N recovered in clover and the greatest amount recovered in dandelion. Thus, understory species composition and biomass appear to be driven by the structure of the overstory community, which is determined by the tree species present and their response to the treatments. However, N acquisition by the understory does not appear to be affected by either the overstory community or the treatments at this point.",9.4.3.1,Plant Growth and Biomass Allocation,0,0

This work was undertaken as the first comparative study of the effects of O3 on the photosynthetic processes and yield of three snap bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) genotypes with known differences in sensitivity to O3 (S156, R123 and R331). Previous information showed R123 and R331 to be tolerant and S156 sensitive. The purpose was to identify physiological subsystems that may mediate those differences in sensitivity. Plants were grown in environmentally controlled field chambers with four levels of O3 (0, 15, 30 and 60 nmol mol?1). Net assimilation (A) and fluorescence were measured throughout the growing season and yield data were collected at physiological maturity. All genotypes were tolerant of low O3 (<30 nmol mol?1) but the highest O3 significantly reduced the yield in all three, with R331 and S156 being equally sensitive on a unit exposure basis. Yield reductions were correlated with A, especially during pod filling. No genotype showed any significant response of stomatal conductance (gs) indicating equal O3 fluxes into the leaves in all genotypes. Mesophyll conductance (gm) was affected in S156 only, where it was reduced by 55% at 60 nmol mol?1 O3. There was an upward trend in F0, and a downward trend in the variable fluorescence ratio (Fv/Fm) with increasing O3 for S156 but not for the other genotypes. S156 was the only genotype to show significant decreases in photochemical quenching (qp) and R123 the only one to show significant decreases in non-photochemical quenching (qn). The sequence of loss of Rubisco content and/or activity and changes in gm, F0, and Fv/Fm could not be resolved in time and may all have been the result of generalized tissue destruction rather than sequential attack on individual subsystems. S156 had the highest photosynthetic rate in clean air but appeared to have no significant capacity to protect Rubisco from attack or to up-regulate Rubisco activity at high O3, thus there was no reserve capacity, while R123 was able to maintain both Rubisco activity and A within narrow ranges. These data suggest that S156 has comparatively little anti-oxidant capacity and/or is deficient in its ability to regulate Rubisco activity. For future studies the best contrasts for resolving questions of physiological sensitivity to O3 would be obtained from R123 and S156.",9.2.3,Field Chambers,8.1.2.1.2,Field Chambers

Results: Standard deviation of all normal-to-normal beat intervals (SDNN) decreased significantly across particles and ozone exposure compared with across filtered-air exposure (P = 0.01). Changes in SDNN-I (P = 0.04) and normalized low and high frequency (P = 0.02) were also seen across particles and ozone exposure; although these changes may best be characterized as trends given the small sample size. No significant changes in HRV were seen across the filtered-air or particles-only exposures.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study concerned 10,881 ED visits for acute ischemic stroke (ICD-9: 434, 436) recorded at Edmonton hospitals between 1992 and 2002. Generalized linear mixed models technique was applied to build the statistical models. The logarithm of daily counts of ED visits for stroke was regressed on the levels of air pollutants (CO, NO2, SO2, and O3) and two meteorological variables. The analyses were performed by (a) age: two age groups were distinguished: 20-64 years (n=2873) and 65-100 years (n=8008); (b) season (all seasons: January-December, warm: April-September, cold: October-March); and (c) gender (both, male, female). 

RESULTS: The results are reported as an excess risk in relation to an increase in the interquartile range (IQR) of the pollutants. In the age group 65-100 years, the excess risk for particular pollutants was as follows: for NO2-8.2% (95% CI: 0.4-16.7) for both genders, in the warm season; for SO2-9.1% (95% CI: 2.2-16.4), for males, in the warm season: for a 1-day lagged SO2-6.0% (95% CI: 0.5-11.8), for females, in the cold season.

Analyses were conducted using all births, and then births where the mother resided within 6 and 12 kilometers of an ambient air quality monitor.---- FINDINGS: When analyzing all births there was no indication that ambient air pollution in Brisbane was associated with a higher risk of cardiac defects. Among births where the mother resided within 6 kilometers of an ambient air quality monitor, a 5 ppb increase in O3 was associated with an increased risk of pulmonary artery and valve defects (OR 2.96, 95% CI: 1.34, 7.52) while a 0.6 ppb increase in SO2 was associated with an increased risk of aortic artery and valve defects (OR 10.76, 95% CI: 1.50, 179.8). For oral cleft defects among all births, the only adverse association was between SO2 and cleft lip with or without cleft palate (OR 1.27, 95% CI: 1.01, 1.62). However, various significant inverse associations were also found between air pollutants and birth defects.---- CONCLUSIONS: This study found mixed results and it is difficult to conclude whether ambient air pollution in Brisbane has an adverse association with the birth defects examined. Studies using more detailed estimates of air pollution exposure are needed.",7.4.7,Birth Defects ,0,0

Underlying biological mechanisms are not entirely clear, and hemostasis and inflammation are suggested to be involved. 

OBJECTIVES: Our aim was to study the association of the variation in local concentrations of airborne particulate matter (PM) with aerodynamic diameter < 10 mum, carbon monoxide, nitrogen monoxide, nitrogen dioxide, and ozone with platelet aggregation, thrombin generation, fibrinogen, and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels in healthy individuals. 

METHODS: From 40 healthy volunteers, we collected 13 consecutive blood samples within a 1-year period and measured light-transmittance platelet aggregometry, thrombin generation, fibrinogen, and CRP. We performed regression analysis using generalized additive models to study the association between the hemostatic and inflammatory variables, and local environmental concentrations of air pollutants for time lags within 24 hr before blood sampling or 24-96 hr before blood sampling. 

RESULTS: In general, air pollutants were associated with platelet aggregation [average, +8% per interquartile range (IQR), p < 0.01] and thrombin generation (average, +1% per IQR, p < 0.05). Platelet aggregation was not affected by in vitro incubation of plasma with PM. We observed no relationship between any of the air pollutants and fibrinogen or CRP levels. 

CONCLUSIONS: Air pollution increased platelet aggregation as well as coagulation activity but had no clear effect on systemic inflammation. These prothrombotic effects may partly explain the relationship between air pollution and the risk of ischemic cardiovascular disease.",6.3.2.4,Biomarkers,4.1.11.1,Epidemiologic Panel Studies

There are few epidemiologic data on the relation of prenatal air pollution exposure and the risk of oral clefts. OBJECTIVES: Our goal in this study was to assess the relations between exposure to ambient air pollution and the risk of cleft lip with or without cleft palate (CL/P). METHODS: We conducted a population-based case-control study of all 653 cases of CL/P and a random sample of 6,530 control subjects from 721,289 Taiwanese newborns in 2001-2003. We used geographic information systems to form exposure parameters for sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, ozone, carbon monoxide, and particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter <or= 10 microm (PM10) during the first 3 months of pregnancy using inverse distance weighting method. We present the effect estimates as odds ratios (ORs) per 10-ppb change for SO2, NO(x), and O3, 100-ppb change for CO, and 10-microg/m3 change for PM10. RESULTS: The risk of CL/P was increased in relation to O3 levels in the first gestational month [adjusted OR = 1.20; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.02-1.39] and second gestational month (adjusted OR = 1.25; 95% CI, 1.03-1.52) in the range from 16.7 ppb to 45.1 ppb, but was not related to CO, NO(x), SO2, or PM10.

However, little is known about which subpopulations are more susceptible to death related to ozone. METHODS: We conducted a case-only study in 48 US cities to identify subpopulations particularly vulnerable to ozone air pollution. Mortality and ozone data were obtained for the period 1989-2000 (May through September of each year) for 2,729,640 decedents. For each potential effect modifier, we fitted city-specific logistic regression models and pooled the results across all cities. Additionally, we examined differences in susceptibility factors according to several city characteristics using a meta-regression. RESULTS: For each 10 ppb increase in ozone (average of lags 0 to 2), people aged > or =65 years had a 1.10% (95% confidence interval = 0.44% to 1.77%) additional increase in mortality (compared with younger ages). Other groups that were particularly susceptible were black people (additional 0.53% [0.19% to 0.87%]), women (additional 0.58% [0.18% to 0.98%]), and those with atrial fibrillation (additional 1.66% [0.03% to 3.32%]). Susceptibility factors had a larger effect in cities with lower ozone levels. For instance, the additional increase in ozone-related mortality for the elderly was 1.48% (0.81% to 2.15%) in a city with a mean ozone level of 42 ppb versus 0.45% (-0.27% to 1.19%) in a city with a level of 51 ppb.

Seedlings of Populus nigra L., Viburnum lantana L. and Fraxinus excelsior L. were exposed to charcoal-filtered air (CF) and non-filtered air (NF) in open-top chambers, and to ambient air (AA) in open plots during the 2001 and 2002 growing seasons. Ambient ozone exposures in the region were sufficient to cause visible foliar injury, early leaf senescence and premature leaf loss in all species. Ozone had significant negative effects on net photosynthesis and stomatal conductance in all species in 2002 and in V. lantana and F. excelsior in 2001. Water-use efficiency decreased and intercellular CO(2) concentrations increased in all species in response to ozone in 2002 only. The width and delta(13)C of the 2001 and 2002 growth rings were measured for all species at the end of the 2002 growing season. Compared with CF seedlings, mean ring width in the AA and NF P. nigra seedlings was reduced by 52 and 46%, respectively, in 2002, whereas in V. lantana and F. excelsior, ring width showed no significant reductions in either year. Although delta(13)C was usually more negative in CF seedlings than in AA and NF seedlings, with the exception of F. excelsior in 2001, ozone effects on delta(13)C were significant only for V. lantana and P. nigra in 2001. Among species, P. nigra exhibited the greatest response to ozone for the measured parameters as well as the most severe foliar injury and was the only species to show a significant reduction in ring width in response to ozone exposure, despite significant negative ozone effects on leaf gas exchange and the development of visible foliar injury in V. lantana and F. excelsior. Thus, significant ozone-induced effects at the leaf level did not correspond to reduced tree-ring growth or increased delta(13)C in all species, indicating that the timing of ozone exposure and severity of leaf-level responses may be important in determining the sensitivity of tree productivity to ozone exposure.",9.3.5.1,Light and Dark Reactions of Photosynthesis,0,0

In the productive San Joaquin Valley (SJV) of California, these species also confront high levels of ozone (O3) air pollution. It is often assumed that C4 species will exhibit tolerance to O3, relative to C3 species, based on limited crop yield-loss data and on responses to a contrasting gaseous air pollutant, sulfur dioxide (SO2). Tolerance to O3 of high-biomass C4 crops such as sugarcane (Saccharum spp.) has not been demonstrated. Here we tested the hypothesis that a clone of sugarcane currently grown on a small commercial scale in the O3?impacted SJV will exhibit tolerance to O3. The hypothesis was disproven. Biomass production declined by over one-third and allocation to roots declined by over two-thirds, over a range of O3 exposures (4, 58, and 114 ppb, 12-h means). These responses are comparable to responses previously reported for O3?sensitive C3 crop species. Greater O3 tolerance may be required to maximize the potential viability of bioethanol production using tall tropical grasses such as sugarcane (for sucrose) or energy canes (for cellulose) in O3?impacted western valleys.

Barring-extreme injury such as tissue damage or stomata closure, most of these disruptive changes are likely to have been initiated at the level of gene expression. The belief is oxidative products formed in ozone exposed leaves, e.g. hydrogen peroxide, are responsible for much of the biochemical adjustments. The first line of defense is a range of antioxidants, such as ascorbate and glutathione, but if this defense is overwhelmed, subsequent actions occur, similar to systemic acquired resistance or general wounding. Yet there are seemingly unrelated metabolic responses which are also triggered, such as early senescence.

Objective: The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of ozone exposure on antioxidant response in BALB/c mice. Methods: We measured enhanced pause of breathing ( Penh) as a marker of airway obstruction using barometric whole-body plethysmography before and after ozone exposure [ groups ( n = 6): filtered air, 0.12 ppm, 0.5 ppm, 1 ppm, 2 ppm] for 3 h. Antioxidant levels were measured using high-performance liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid and lung tissue homogenates. Results: Malondialdehyde concentrations in lung tissue homogenates were significantly increased in the group exposed to 2-ppm ozone compared to the filtered air group. Uric acid and gamma-tocopherol concentrations in BAL fluid were significantly increased in the ozone exposure group compared to the filtered air group ( p < 0.01). Uric acid concentrations were increased in a concentration-dependent manner according to ozone concentration to which the animals were exposed. Increases in Penh after ozone exposure were significantly higher in an ozone concentration-dependent manner. The proportion of neutrophils in BAL fluid was significantly higher in the group exposed to 2 ppm than in the filtered air and the group exposed to 0.12 ppm ( p < 0.01, respectively). The level of ascorbate correlated with the level of gamma-tocopherol.

In a prospective birth cohort of 241 healthy term-born neonates, tidal breathing, lung volume, ventilation inhomogeneity and exhaled nitric oxide (eNO) were measured during unsedated sleep at age 5 weeks. Maternal exposure to particles with a 50% cut-off aerodynamic diameter of 10 ?m (PM10), nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and ozone (O3), and distance to major roads were estimated during pregnancy.

The data included total daily hospital admissions due to respiratory diseases for children 0-17 years old from 1991 to 2001 in NYS (N=134,099) and daily ambient O(3) level with different single-day lags. These analyses adjusted for particulate matter 10 microm in size (PM(10)), meteorological conditions, day of the week, seasonality, long-term trends, and demographic characteristics. RESULTS: In 5 of the 11 regions, including the Upper and Lower Adirondacks, Upper Hudson Valley, Staten Island, and New York City, positive associations were found between respiratory hospital admissions and ambient O(3) level 2 days prior to the admission. Applying different statistical methods and sensitivity analysis of PM(10) did not alter these findings. When region-specific results were combined, no statewide association was apparent. CONCLUSIONS: Geographic differences were found in the associations between O(3) levels and respiratory hospital admissions among children. In addition, we found that the two-stage model may be an appropriate approach for tracking the health effects of air pollution over time in different geographic areas when heterogeneity of risk factors across regions is present.",6.2.7.1,Summary of Findings from 26 O3 AQCD,0,0

METHODS: A time-series analysis was conducted on nearly 400,000 ED visits to 14 hospitals in seven Canadian cities during the 1990 s and early 2000s. Associations were examined between carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), ozone (O3), sulfur dioxide (SO2), and particulate matter (PM 10 and PM2.5), and visits for angina/myocardial infarction, heart failure, dysrhythmia/conduction disturbance, asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and respiratory infections. Daily and 3-hourly visit counts were modeled as quasi-Poisson and analyses controlled for effects of temporal cycles, weather, day of week and holidays. 

RESULTS: 24-hour average concentrations of CO and NO2 lag 0 days exhibited the most consistent associations with cardiac conditions (2.1% (95% CI, 0.0-4.2%) and 2.6% (95% CI, 0.2-5.0%) increase in visits for myocardial infarction/angina per 0.7 ppm CO and 18.4 ppb NO2 respectively; 3.8% (95% CI, 0.7-6.9%) and 4.7% (95% CI, 1.2-8.4%) increase in visits for heart failure). Ozone (lag 2 days) was most consistently associated with respiratory visits (3.2% (95% CI, 0.3-6.2%), and 3.7% (95% CI, -0.5-7.9%) increases in asthma and COPD visits respectively per 18.4 ppb). Associations tended to be of greater magnitude during the warm season (April - September). In particular, the associations of PM 10 and PM2.5 with asthma visits were respectively nearly three- and over fourfold larger vs. all year analyses (14.4% increase in visits, 95% CI, 0.2-30.7, per 20.6 microg/m3 PM 10 and 7.6% increase in visits, 95% CI, 5.1-10.1, per 8.2 microg/m3 PM2.5). No consistent associations were observed between three hour average pollutant concentrations and same-day three hour averages of ED visits. 

CONCLUSION: In this large multicenter analysis, daily average concentrations of CO and NO2 exhibited the most consistent associations with ED visits for cardiac conditions, while ozone exhibited the most consistent associations with visits for respiratory conditions. PM 10 and PM2.5 were strongly associated with asthma visits during the warm season.",6.2.7.1,Summary of Findings from 26 O3 AQCD,3.1.5.2,Emergency Department (ED) Visits

However, few have examined the possible confounding influence of aeroallergens, or reported findings among very young children. METHODS: A time stratified case-crossover design was used to examine 57,912 ED asthma visits among individuals two years of age and older in the census metropolitan area of Edmonton, Canada between April 1, 1992 and March 31, 2002. Daily air pollution levels for the entire region were estimated from three fixed-site monitoring stations. Similarly, daily levels of aeroallergens were estimated using rotational impaction sampling methods for the period between 1996 and 2002. Odds ratios and their corresponding 95% confidence intervals were estimated using conditional logistic regression with adjustment for temperature, relative humidity and seasonal epidemics of viral related respiratory disease. RESULTS: Positive associations for asthma visits with outdoor air pollution levels were observed between April and September, but were absent during the remainder of the year. Effects were strongest among young children. Namely, an increase in the interquartile range of the 5-day average for NO2 and CO levels between April and September was associated with a 50% and 48% increase, respectively, in the number of ED visits among children 2 - 4 years of age (p < 0.05). Strong associations were also observed with these pollutants among those 75 years of age and older. Ozone and particulate matter were also associated with asthma visits. Air pollution risk estimates were largely unchanged after adjustment for aeroallergen levels. CONCLUSION: Our findings, taken together, suggest that exposure to ambient levels of air pollution is an important determinant of ED visits for asthma, particularly among young children and the elderly.",6.2.7.1,Summary of Findings from 26 O3 AQCD,3.1.5.2,Emergency Department (ED) Visits

We investigated whether obesity and airways hyperresponsiveness (AHR) modify the acute effects of ozone on lung function in the elderly. METHODS: We studied 904 elderly men from the Normative Aging Study whose lung function (FVC, FEV1) was measured approximately every 3 years from 1995 to 2005. We defined obesity as a body mass index of at least 30 kg/m2. Using a standardized methacholine challenge test, we defined AHR as a FEV1 decline of 20% after inhalation of a cumulative dosage of 0 to 8.58 micromol of methacholine. Ambient ozone in the Greater Boston area was measured continuously. We estimated effects using mixed linear models, adjusting for known confounders. RESULTS: An increase in ozone of 15 parts per billion during the previous 48 h was associated with a greater decline in FEV1 in the obese (-2.07%; 95% confidence interval [CI], -3.25 to -0.89%) than in the nonobese (-0.96%; 95% CI, -1.70 to - 0.20%). The same exposure was also associated with a greater decline in FEV1 for those with AHR (-3.07%; 95% CI, -4.75 to -1.36%) compared to those without AHR (-1.32%; 95% CI, -2.06 to -0.57%). A three-way interaction trend test demonstrated a multiplicative effect of those two risk factors (p < 0.001). We found similar associations for FVC. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that both obesity and AHR modify the acute effect of ozone on lung function in the elderly, with evidence of interaction between AHR and obesity that causes a greater than additive effect.",6.2.1.2,Epidemiology,3.1.6.2.1,Lung Function

This study investigated the acute effects of O(3) on lung function in the elderly, a suspected risk group. It then investigated whether genetic polymorphisms of antioxidant genes (heme oxygenase-1 (HMOX1) and glutathione S-transferase pi (GSTP1)) modified these associations. METHODS: 1100 elderly men from the Normative Aging Study were examined whose lung function (forced vital capacity (FVC) and forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1)) was measured every 3 years from 1995 to 2005. The study genotyped the GSTP1 Ile105Val and Ala114Val polymorphisms and the (GT)n repeat polymorphism in the HMOX1 promoter, classifying repeats as short (n<25) or long (n> or =25). Ambient O(3) was measured continuously at locations in the Greater Boston area. Mixed linear models were used, adjusting for known confounders. RESULTS: A 15 ppb increase in O(3) during the previous 48 h was associated with a 1.25% decrease in FEV(1) (95% CI: -1.96% to -0.54%). This estimated effect was worsened with either the presence of a long (GT)n repeat in HMOX1 (-1.38%, 95% CI: -2.11% to -0.65%) or the presence of an allele coding for Val105 in GSTP1 (-1.69%, 95% CI: -2.63% to -0.75%). A stronger estimated effect of O(3) on FEV(1) was found in subjects carrying both the GSTP1 105Val variant and the HMOX1 long (GT)n repeat (-1.94%, 95% CI: -2.89% to -0.98%). Similar associations were also found between FVC and O(3) exposure.

The U.S. EPA Building Assessment Survey and Evaluation (BASE) study data were analyzed for associations between ambient ozone concentrations and building-related symptom (BRS) prevalence. Multiple logistic regression (MLR) models, adjusted for personal, workplace, and environmental variables, revealed positive relationships (P < 0.05) between ambient ozone concentrations and upper respiratory (UR), dry eyes, neurological and headache BRS (odds ratios ranged from 1.03 to 1.04 per 10 mug/m(3) increase in ambient ozone concentrations). Other BRS had marginally significant relationships with ambient ozone (P < 0.10). A linear dose-response in UR symptoms was observed with increasing ambient ozone (P = 0.03); most other symptoms showed similar but not statistically significant trends. Ambient ozone correlated with indoor concentrations of some aldehydes, a pattern suggesting the occurrence of indoor ozone chemistry. Coupled with the MLR ambient ozone-BRS analysis, this correlation is consistent with the hypothesis that ozone-initiated indoor reactions play an important role in indoor air quality and building occupant health. Replication with increased statistical power and with longitudinal data is needed. If the observed associations are confirmed as causal, ventilation system ozone removal technologies could reduce UR BRS prevalence when higher ambient ozone levels are present. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS: This paper provides strong statistical evidence that supports (but does not prove) the hypothesis that ozone entrained into buildings from the outdoor air is involved in increasing the frequency that occupants experience and a range of upper and lower respiratory, mucosal and neurological symptoms by as much as a factor of 2 when ambient ozone levels increase from those found in low-ozone regions to those typical of high-ozone regions. Although replication is needed, the implication is that reducing the amount of ozone entrained into building ventilation systems, either by ambient pollution reduction or engineered gas-phase filtration, may substantially reduce the prevalence of these symptoms experienced by occupants.",6.2.4.3,Populations not Restricted to Individuals with Asthma,0,0

Asthma morbidity also varies with socioeconomic position (SEP). Few studies have examined if ambient air pollution has a differential impact on income subgroups of the population. This paper investigates socioeconomic variation in ambulatory physician consultations for asthma and assesses possible effect modification of SEP on the association between physician visits and air pollution for children aged 1-17 and adults aged 18-64 in Toronto, Canada, between 1992 and 2001. METHODS: Generalized additive models and generalized linear models were used to estimate the adjusted risk of asthma physician visits associated with an interquartile range increase in sulfur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), particulate matter (PM2.5), and ozone (O3). RESULTS: A socioeconomic gradient in the number of physician visits was observed among children and adults and both sexes. SO2, NO2, and PM2.5 had positive associations with physician visits. The risk ratios for the low socioeconomic group were significantly greater than those for the high socioeconomic group in several of the models of SO2 and PM2.5. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest increased ambulatory physician visits represent another component of the public health impact of urban air pollution. The burden of this impact may be borne disproportionately by those with lower SEP. Clarifying the role of SEP in altering susceptibility to the effects of air pollution is essential not only to inform revisions of ambient air quality standards, but also to design public health interventions to reduce health impacts on sensitive subgroups of the population.",6.2.7.1,Summary of Findings from 26 O3 AQCD,0,0

The data are for a sample of individuals living near Los Angeles. Our approach differs from earlier ones in that we use a system of equations that allows for correlations across activity types. The empirical results suggest that increased ozone levels have a statistically significant influence on the amount of time that asthmatics spend in one of the activities, even though the examined time period exhibited relatively low ozone levels. Elasticities are estimated to better indicate the sensitivity of humans' activity schedules to pollution levels, and the one ozone effect is shown to be fairly weak. This study adds to the existing literature on the influence of ozone on asthma and asthma sufferers, some of which finds a causal link while other studies do not. The study results are also of interest because the asthmatics in the sample are all adults, whereas some recent research showing a link between ozone and asthma has focused on children.",6.2.3.2,Epidemiology,0,0

Cases included newly diagnosed lung cancer (n = 115), upper respiratory cancers (pharynx and larynx; n = 82), bladder cancer (n = 124), leukemia (n = 166), and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or emphysema deaths (n = 77) accrued after a median follow-up of 7 years among the EPIC former smokers and never-smokers. Three controls per case were matched for questionnaire analyses and two controls per case for laboratory analyses. Matching criteria were gender, age, smoking status, country of recruitment, and follow-up time. Individual exposure to air pollution was assessed using concentration data from monitoring stations in routine air quality monitoring networks. Leukocyte DNA adducts were analyzed blindly using 32P postlabeling technique. Adducts were associated with the subsequent risk of lung cancer, with an odds ratio (OR) of 1.86 [95% confidence interval (95% CI), 0.88-3.93] when comparing detectable versus nondetectable adducts.

This paper aimed to determine whether environmental factors could have been responsible for this 'outbreak'. METHODS: The outcome studied was daily counts of emergency department visits for cardiovascular or chest pain syndromes that were considered immediately or imminently life threatening on arrival at hospital. The outbreak had a mean daily count of 5.7 visits sustained for eight weeks, compared with 4.0 in the same months in previous years. Poisson regression was used to systematically assess the emergency department visits in relation to available daily weather and pollution variables by first finding the best model that explained short-term variation in the outcome over the period 25 January 2002 to 31 May 2005, and then assessing interactions of all available variables with the 'outbreak' period, April-May 2005. Rate ratios were estimated for an interquartile increase in each variable meaning that the ratio measures the relative increase (or decrease) in the emergency department visits for an interquartile increase in the weather or pollution variable. The rate ratios for the outbreak period measure the relative increase (or decrease) in the emergency department visits for an interquartile increase in the weather or pollution variable during the outbreak period only. RESULTS: The best fitting model over the whole study period included minimum temperature with a rate ratio (RR) of 0.86 (95% confidence interval (CI), 0.77-0.96), maximum relative humidity of 1.09 (95% CI 1.05-1.14) and minimum daily particulate matter less than 10 microns (PM10) of 1.05 (95% CI, 1.01-1.09).

We defined chronic ozone exposure using three indicators: mean concentration during the follow-up period, mean concentration during the ozone season, and proportion of follow-up days with ozone levels > 70 ppb. We performed logistic regression analysis to adjust for child's age, sex, birth weight, and gestational age; maternal race/ethnicity, age, education, insurance status, smoking during pregnancy, and poverty level; and geographic region, temperature, and co-pollutants. 

RESULTS: Asthma admissions were significantly associated with increased ozone levels for all chronic exposure indicators (odds ratios, 1.16-1.68), with a positive dose-response relationship. We found stronger associations among younger children, low sociodemographic groups, and New York City residents as effect modifiers. 

CONCLUSION: Chronic exposure to ambient ozone may increase the risk of asthma admissions among children. Younger children and those in low socioeconomic groups have a greater risk of asthma than do other children at the same ozone level.",7.2.2,Asthma Hospital Admissions and ED Visits,0,0

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has concluded that children with asthma continue to be susceptible to ozone-associated adverse effects on their disease. OBJECTIVES: This study was designed to evaluate time trends in associations between declining warm-season O(3) concentrations and hospitalization for asthma in children. METHODS: We undertook an ecologic study of hospital discharges for asthma during the high O(3) seasons in California's South Coast Air Basin (SoCAB) in children who ranged in age from birth to 19 years from 1983 to 2000. We used standard association and causal statistical analysis methods. Hospital discharge data were obtained from the State of California; air pollution data were obtained from the California Air Resources Board, and demographic data from the 1980, 1990, and 2000 U.S. Census. SoCAB was divided into 195 spatial grids, and quarterly average O(3), sulfurdioxide, particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter < or = 10 microm, nitrogen dioxide, and carbon monoxide were assigned to each unit for 3-month periods along with demographic variables. RESULTS: O(3) was the only pollutant associated with increased hospital admissions over the study period. Inclusion of a variety of demographic and weather variables accounted for all of the non-O(3) temporal changes in hospitalizations. We found a time-independent, constant effect of ambient levels of O(3) and quarterly hospital discharge rates for asthma. We estimate that the average effect of a 10-ppb mean increase in any given mean quarterly 1-hr maximum O(3) over the 18-year median of 87.7 ppb was a 4.6% increase in the same quarterly outcome. CONCLUSIONS: Our data indicate that at current levels of O(3) experienced in Southern California, O(3) contributes to an increased risk of hospitalization for children with asthma.",7.2.2,Asthma Hospital Admissions and ED Visits,3.2.4.5.1,Epidemiologic Studies

Overall, statistically significant positive correlations between average ozone concentrations and DNA damage emerged in almost all time-windows considered; correlations were more evident among males, non-smokers, and traffic-exposed workers. Multivariate regression analyses taking into account selected individual characteristics, showed an independent effect on DNA damage of average ozone concentrations in the last 60-90days before blood drawing.

METHODS: Associations of the well characterised null variant of GSTM1 and four single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that characterised common variation in the GSTP1 locus with new onset asthma in a cohort of 1610 school children were examined. Children's exercise and ozone exposure were classified using participation in team sports and community annual average ozone levels, respectively. RESULTS: A two SNP model involving putatively functional variants (rs6591255, rs1695 (Ile105Va)) best captured the association between GSTP1 and asthma. The risk of asthma was lower for those with the Val allele of Ile105Val (hazard ratio (HR) 0.60, 95% CI 0.4 to 0.8) and higher for the variant allele of rs6591255 (HR 1.40, 95% CI 1.1 to 1.9). The risk of asthma increased with level of exercise among ile(105) homozygotes but not among those with at least one val(105) allele (interaction p value = 0.02). The risk was highest among ile(105) homozygotes who participated in >or=3 sports in the high ozone communities (HR 6.15, 95% CI 2.2 to 7.4). GSTM1 null was independently associated with an increased risk of asthma and showed little variation with air pollution or GSTP1 genotype. These results were consistent in two independent fourth grade cohorts recruited in 1993 and 1996.

The aim was to examine the relationship between air pollution concentrations and total IgE levels in adult asthmatics. METHODS: The present study relates to the 369 asthmatic adults from the French Epidemiological study on Genetics and Environment of Asthma (EGEA), with availability of data on both total serum IgE measurements and air pollution concentrations. Geo-statistical models were performed on 4 x 4 km grids to assess individual outdoor air pollution exposure. Annual outdoor concentrations of ozone (O(3)), nitrogen dioxide (NO(2)), sulphur dioxide (SO(2)), and particulate matter smaller than 10 microm size (PM(10)), and concentrations of summer ozone were assigned to subject's home address. RESULTS: The geometric mean of total IgE was 161 IU/ml and the average of O(3) exposure was 44.9 +/- 9.5 microg/m(3). Ozone concentrations were positively related to total IgE levels and an increase of 10 microg/m(3) of O(3) resulted in an increase of 20.4% (95% CI = 3.0-40.7) in total IgE levels. Adjustment for age, gender, smoking habits and previous life in the countryside did not change the results, and an increase of 19.1% (2.4-38.6) in total IgE was observed with O(3). Negative associations observed between NO(2) and total IgE levels disappeared after including O(3) in the models. Neither SO(2) nor PM(10) were correlated with total IgE levels.

The aim was to assess the relation between asthma severity during the past 12 months and home outdoor concentrations of air pollution. 

METHODS: Asthma severity over the past 12 months was assessed in two complementary ways among 328 adult asthmatics from the French Epidemiological study on the Genetics and Environment of Asthma (EGEA) examined between 1991 and 1995. The four-class severity score integrated clinical events and type of treatment. The five-level asthma score is based only on the occurrence of symptoms. Nitrogen dioxide (NO(2)), sulphur dioxide (SO(2)) and ozone (O(3)) concentrations were assigned to each residence using two different methods. The first was based on the closest monitor data from 1991 to 1995. The second consisted of spatial models that used geostatistical interpolations and then assigned air pollutants to the geo-coded residences (1998). 

RESULTS: Higher asthma severity score was significantly related to the 8-hour average of ozone during April-September (O(3)-8 h) and the number of days (O(3)-days) with 8-hour ozone averages above 110 microg.m(-3) (for a 36-day increase, equivalent to the interquartile range, in O(3)-days, odds ratio 2.22 (95% confidence interval 1.61 to 3.07) for one class difference in score). Adjustment for age, sex, smoking habits, occupational exposure, and educational level did not alter results. Asthma severity was unrelated to NO(2). Both exposure assessment methods and severity scores resulted in very similar findings. SO(2) correlated with severity but reached statistical significance only for the model-based assignment of exposure.

OBJECTIVES: We aimed to assess modifying effects of influenza on health effects of ambient air pollutants. METHODS: We applied Poisson regression to daily numbers of hospitalizations and mortality to develop core models after adjustment for potential time-varying confounding variables. We assessed modification of influenza by adding variables for concentrations of single ambient air pollutants and proportions of influenza-positive specimens (influenza intensity) and their cross-product terms. RESULTS: We found significant effect modification of influenza (p < 0.05) for effects of ozone. When influenza intensity is assumed to increase from 0% to 10%, the excess risks per 10-microg/m(3) increase in concentration of O(3) increased 0.24% and 0.40% for hospitalization of respiratory disease in the all-ages group and >or= 65 year age group, respectively; 0.46% for hospitalization of acute respiratory disease in the all-ages group; and 0.40% for hospitalization of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in the >or= 65 group.

The incidence and severity of ozone-induced symptoms on both species were directly related to ozone concentration and duration of exposure. The most common foliar symptom was classic, dark, adaxial stipple, similar to symptoms ascribed to ambient ozone in the field. Indian Hemp was more sensitive to ozone than Common Milkweed. Both species exhibited considerable intraspecific variation in ozone sensitivity. Variability in the data was too great to assign definitive ozone-sensitivity ratings within geographic regions from which seed was selected.

Co-incubation of macrophage cells (J774.1) with atheronal-A (25 microM) and atheronal-B (25 microM) when complexed with low-density lipoprotein (LDL) (100 microg/mL) leads to a significant upregulation of scavenger receptor class A (approximately 3-fold increase relative to LDL alone, p < 0.05) but not CD36, showing that cultured macrophages respond to LDL-complexed atheronals in a manner highly analogous to acetylated LDL rather than oxidized LDL. Both atheronal-A and atheronal-B in solution exhibit a dose-dependent (0-25 microM) induction of chemotaxis of cultured macrophages (p < 0.001).

Effects of observed VPD differences (Delta VPD) between OTCs and the ambient air (AA) on stomatal conductance (g(s)) were simulated using 10 model functions from the literature. The dataset originated from 17 OTC crop experiments performed in Belgium, Germany and Sweden. Delta VPD is the resulting difference between the OTC effect on e(s)(T), which is the temperature-dependent saturation pressure of water vapour and the OTC effect on e(a), which is the prevailing partial pressure of water vapour in the air (Delta VPD = Delta e(s)(T) - Delta e(a)). Both Delta e(s)(T) and Delta e(a) were positive during daylight hours. Delta VPD was small in comparison and sensitive to changes in Delta e(s)(T) or Delta e(a). Delta VPD was negative between 07:30 and 10:30 and positive thereafter with a maximum at 20:30 (local time). The positive afternoon Delta VPD was due to an early decrease in Delta e(a), probably caused by ceased transpiration, while the positive Delta e(s)(T) persisted throughout the evening, most likely because of restrained cooling in the OTCs. Both the negative morning Delta VPD and the positive evening Delta VPD were more pronounced during clear, warm and dry weather. Circumstances when VPD had a stronger limiting effect on g(s) inside the OTCs compared to in the ambient air coincided with high ambient ozone concentrations ([O-3]). Calculated wheat O-3 uptake over an [O-3] threshold of 40 nmol mol(-1) was reduced by 8.7% in OTCs, assuming that VPD was the only factor limiting gs and that g(s) was the only resistance for O-3 uptake. VPD is one factor of considerable importance for g(s) and the OTC impact on VPD may contribute to an underestimation of O-3 effects expressed in relation to the external O-3 exposure.

The response of both salicylate and ethylene, the major phytohormones that modulate ozone-induced cell death, have now been analysed in SIPK-OX tobacco plants. Ozone treatment strongly induced ethylene formation in the sensitive SIPK-OX plants at ozone concentrations that failed to elicit stress ethylene release in WT plants. By contrast, SIPK-overexpressing plants displayed no ozone-induced SA accumulation, whereas WT plants accumulated SA upon ozone exposure.

Regal) clones with different ozone sensitivity,"Crous, KY; Vandermeiren, K; Ceulemans, R",2006,"Critical ozone levels must be determined to assess ozone damage on plants, but the cumulative ozone exposure concept of 'AOT40' fails to consider actual ozone uptake via the stomata. While the use of ozone fluxes to assess ozone-induced plant responses is mechanistically appropriate, few studies have examined the relationship between cumulative ozone fluxes and physiological dysfunction. Physiological differences between a widely used ozone-sensitive (NC-S) and ozone-resistant (NC-R) bio-monitor clone of white clover (Trifolium repens L. cv. Regal) were studied and related to cumulative ozone fluxes (CUO3). Generally, no physiological effect of ozone uptake was detected in the NC-R. clone, whereas there were negative responses in the NC-S clone for most leaf gas exchange parameters, including net photosynthesis (A(sat)) and carboxylation capacity (V-cmax). Stomatal conductance (g(s)) was not significantly different between clones in ozone-free conditions, but gs decreased significantly for the NC-S clone during ozone exposure. The NC-S clone showed higher electron transport rates but lower non-photochemical quenching under high photon flux densities and elevated ozone compared to NC-R clone. Our results suggest that avoiding ozone-induced damage depends on the ability of different genotypes to reduce O-3 uptake through stomatal closure and on the capacity for non-photochemical quenching to scavenge reactive oxygen. Relating key physiological parameters to cumulative ozone fluxes contributes to refining flux-based ozone uptake models used in setting critical ozone levels to alleviate the detrimental impact of O-3 exposure on vegetation.

Three days after ozone fumigation, the necrotic leaf area was significantly higher in isoprene-inhibited leaves than in isoprene-emitting leaves. Isoprene-inhibited leaves also accumulated high amounts of nitric oxide (NO), as detected by epifluorescence light microscopy. Our results confirm that oxidative stresses activate biosynthesis and emission of chloroplastic isoprenoid, bringing further evidence in support of an antioxidant role for these compounds.

Long-term exposure of higher plants to low ozone concentrations affects biochemical processes prior to any visible symptoms of injury. The current critical level of ozone used to determine the threshold for damaging plants (biomass loss) is still based on the seasonal sum of the external concentration above 40 nl center dot l-1 (AOT40). Taking into account stomatal conductance and the internal capacity of leaf defences, a more relevant concept should be based upon the 'effective ozone flux', the balance between the stomatal flux and the intensity of cellular detoxification. The large decrease in the Rubisco/PEPc ratio reflects photosynthetic damage from ozone, and a large increase in activity of cytosolic PEPc, which allows increased malate production. Although the direct detoxification of ozone (and ROS produced from its decomposition) is carried out primarily by cell wall ascorbate, the existing level of this antioxidant is not sufficient to indicate the degree of cell sensitivity. In order to regenerate ascorbate, NAD(P)H is needed as the primary supplier of reducing power. It is hypothesised that increased activity of the catabolic pathways and associated shunts (glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, NADP-dependent glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, isocitrate dehydrogenase and malic enzyme) can provide sufficient NAD(P)H to maintain intracellular detoxification.

Photosynthesis of both varieties were adversely affected, but the reduction was higher in PK 472 than Bragg. A comparison of chlorophyll a fluorescence kinetics with carbon fixation suggested greater sensitivity of dark reactions than light reactions of photosynthesis to O-3 stress. The O-3-induced uncoupling between photosynthesis and stomatal conductance in PK 472 suggests the reduction in photosynthesis may be attributed to a factor other than reduced stomatal conductance. An increase in internal CO2 concentration in both O-3-treated soybean varieties compared suggests that the reduction in photosynthesis was due to damage to the photosynthetic apparatus, leading to accumulation of internal CO2 and stomatal closure. The adverse impact of O-3 stress increased at higher O-3 concentrations in both soybean varieties leading to large reductions in photosynthesis.

Results from a 4-year biomonitoring study in an urban-industrial biomonitoring network using highly-sensitive tobacco Bel W3 plants are presented. The results corroborate earlier findings from regional studies insofar as ozone response of Bel W3 tobacco in terms of visible injury provides an integration over the environmental factors most crucial for ozone effects on plants: external dose of ozone and vapour pressure deficit (VPD), the latter being most influential on stomatal reaction and, thus, on the ozone flux into the leaf.

The results show that elevated ozone exposure induced a greater superoxide anion (O-2(-)) generating rate and higher hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) content. Malondialdehyde (MDA) content as an index of lipid peroxidation also increased. The activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD), ascorbate peroxidase (APX), monodehydroascorbate reductase (MDAR), glutathione reductase (GR), and dehydroascorbate reductase (DHAR) were enhanced by high ozone exposure in the first half of the season before falling to levels lower than those of control. The ascorbic acid content was always lower in the high-ozone exposed leaves. We conclude that the antioxidant system in Ginkgo biloba did respond by acclimating in the early season.

In addition, to better understand ABA signalling and the interactions between stress response pathways, we performed a microarray analysis of drought-treated plants. Functional categorization of the identified genes showed that ABI1 is involved in the modulation of several cellular processes including metabolism, transport, development, information pathways and variant splicing. Comparisons with available transcriptome data sets revealed the extent of ABI1 involvement in both ABA-dependent and ABA-independent gene expression. Furthermore, in O-3 stress the ABA hypersensitivity of abi1td resulted in a significant reduction of the ABA level, ethylene (ET) over-production and O-3 tolerance. Moreover, the physical interaction of ABI1 with ACC synthase2 and ACC synthase6 was shown. We provide a model explaining how ABI1 can regulate both ABA and ET biosynthesis.

Previous work from NMMAPS reported a statistically significant association between ambient 24-h ozone and short-term mortality when averaged across 98U.S. cities. Separation of ozone health associations from effects due to weather and co-pollutants is central to their interpretation. We examined the sensitivity of city-specific ozone-mortality estimates to adjustments for confounders and effect modifiers, showing substantial sensitivity. We examined ozone-mortality associations in different concentration ranges, finding a larger incremental effect in higher ranges, but also larger uncertainty. Alternative ozone exposure metrics defined by maximum 8-h averages or 1-h maxima show different ozone-mortality associations that cannot be explained by simple scaling relationships. The emphasis in earlier studies based on NMMAPS has been on the reporting of ?national? effects, together with prediction intervals that suggest that these national values are precisely estimated. Our view is that ozone-mortality associations, based on time-series epidemiologic analyses of daily data from multiple cities, reveal still-unexplained inconsistencies and show sensitivity to modeling choices and data selection that contribute to serious uncertainties when epidemiological results are used to discern the nature and magnitude of possible ozone-mortality relationships or are applied to risk assessment.",6.6.2.1,Confounding,0,0

However, it is unknown whether this process is reversible, so that limiting pollution will benefit these children. We measured the short-term response of allergic asthmatic children exposed to a real-life reduction in outdoor air pollution by using noninvasive biomarkers of airway inflammation and function. 

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Thirty-seven untreated allergic children with mild persistent asthma were recruited from a highly polluted urban environment and relocated to a less polluted rural environment. Air pollution, pollen counts, and meteorological conditions were carefully monitored at both sites. Nasal eosinophils, fractional exhaled nitric oxide, peak expiratory flow, and urinary leukotriene E(4) were measured first in the urban environment and then again 7 days after relocation to the rural environment. 

RESULTS: One week after relocation to the rural environment, we measured, on average, a fourfold decrease in nasal eosinophils and significant decrease in fractional exhaled nitric oxide. We also noted an improvement in lower airway function, reflected by highly significant increase in peak expiratory flow. In contrast, mean urinary leukotriene E(4) concentration remained unchanged after 1 week of exposure to the rural environment. 

CONCLUSIONS: Better air quality is associated with a rapid reduction of airway inflammation in allergic asthmatic children. Nasal eosinophils and fractional exhaled nitric oxide are sensitive indicators of this effect, and their rapid decline is paralleled by improved airway function measured by peak expiratory flow.

It is the balance between O3 uptake and cellular antioxidant potential that determines O3 effects on vegetation. The greater sensitivity to ambient O3 exposure (60 nl l?1 O3, 15 days, 5 h a day) of poplar clone Eridano (Populus deltoides x maximowiczii) compared with clone I-214 (P. x euramericana) was reflected in a lower photosynthetic efficiency, higher stomatal conductance and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) accumulation and more pronounced leaf tissue membrane injury in Eridano than in I-214. We checked if the differences in clonal responses to O3 fumigation were related to differing capacities for antioxidant defense and phenylpropanoid metabolism and found that the increases in foliar ascorbate and phenolic concentrations and phenylpropanoid metabolism in Eridano were insufficient to counteract H2O2 accumulation and the consequent oxidative stress.

In the present study, the hypothesis that polymorphisms in the GSTT1, GSTM1 and GSTP1 genes are associated with atopic and nonatopic asthma was examined. METHODOLOGY: The study population consisted of 103 unrelated healthy individuals and 101 patients with bronchial asthma (64 atopic, 37 nonatopic). Asthma was diagnosed according to the American Thoracic Society statement. Genotyping of polymorphisms in the GSTT1, GSTM1 and GSTP1 genes was performed using real time polymerase chain reaction with a Light Cycler instrument and hybridization probes in combination with the Light Cycler DNA master hybridization probes kit. RESULTS: Patients with atopic asthma (34.4%) had a higher prevalence of the GSTT1 null genotype than the nonatopic asthma patients (13.5%; OR = 3.83; 95% CI, 1.24-11.78). Asthma patients (63.4%) had a higher prevalence of the GSTM1 null genotype than the control group (40.8%; OR = 2.34; 95% CI, 1.31-4.20). Subjects with the GSTP1 homozygous Val/Val genotype had a 3.55-fold increased risk of having atopic asthma compared to nonatopic asthma (OR = 3.55; 95% CI, 1.10-12.56). CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that the GSTT1 and GSTM1 null genotypes and the GSTP1 Val/Val polymorphism may play important roles in asthma pathogenesis. It is possible that intermediate electrophilic metabolites, arising in the first phase of detoxification, are not metabolized by GST enzymes in asthmatic patients and are not excreted. These intermediate metabolites may damage cells and generate oxidative stress, and so contribute to the pathogenesis of asthma.",6.2.4.1,Children with Asthma,0,0

One genetic variant (G-308A) in the promoter region affecting the expression of this cytokine may contribute to airway inflammatory diseases, but the studies on bronchitic symptoms were still inconclusive. Because ozone produces oxidative stress, increased airway TNF, and inflammation, the associations of the TNF-308 polymorphism with bronchitic symptoms may vary by ambient ozone exposure. METHODS: We studied associations of TNF-308 genotype with bronchitic symptoms among asthmatic children in Children's Health Study. The association of TNF G-308A polymorphism with bronchitic symptoms was investigated and we also determined whether the associations vary with ambient ozone exposure. RESULTS: Asthmatic children with TNF-308 GG genotype had a significantly reduced risk of bronchitic symptoms with low-ozone exposure (adjusted OR: 0.53; 95% CI: 0.31-0.91). The risk was not reduced in children living in high-ozone communities (adjusted OR: 1.42; 95% CI: 0.75-2.70). This difference in genotypic effects between low- and high-ozone environments was statistically significant among asthmatics (P for interaction = 0.01), but insignificant among nonasthmatic children.

Chronic ozone exposure causes a secondary increase of reactive oxygen species, which cause an oxidative-stress state in the organism. Ozone is one of the main components of photochemical pollution. Our purpose was to test that oxidative stress caused by chronic low doses of ozone, by itself, alters adult neurogenesis and causes progressive neurodegeneration in the hippocampus, which actions lead to the loss of brain plasticity in the mature central nervous system of rats. Animals were exposed to an ozone-free air stream and for 15, 30, 60, and 90 days to low doses of ozone to cause oxidative stress. Each group was then tested by 1) a spectrophotometer test to quantify lipid peroxidation levels, 2) immunohistochemistry testing against doublecortine, Neu-N, p53, microglia, and glial fibrillary-acidic protein (GFAP), 3) western blot tests for doublecortine and Neu-N, and 4) a one-trial passive avoidance test. Our results indicated that ozone causes an increase of lipid peroxidation levels, morphological changes in the nucleus and the cytoplasm, and cell swelling in neurons. The western blot shows a decrease for Neu-N and doublecortine. Activated and later phagocytic microglia and an increased number of astrocytes were found. There was a memory deficiency positively related to the amount of ozone exposure. These alterations suggest that oxidative stress caused by low doses of ozone causes dysregulation of inflammatory processes, progressive neurodegeneration, chronic loss of brain repair in the hippocampus, and brain plasticity changes in the rat analogous to those seen in Alzheimer's disease.",6.4,Central Nervous System Effects ,0,0

Fibrin obtained from oxidized fibrinogen exhibits higher average fiber mass/length ratio compared with native fibrin. Fibrinogen ozonation sharply reduced the latent period preceding aggregation of protein molecules; however, the mechanism of self-assembly of ozonated and non-ozonated fibrinogen cluster was identical. In both cases flexible polymers are formed and reaching a certain critical length they form densely packed structures and aggregate. Using infrared spectroscopy, it has been shown that free radical oxidation of amino acid residues of fibrinogen polypeptide chains catalyzed by ozone results in formation of carbonyl, hydroxyl, and ether groups. It is concluded that fibrinogen peripheral D-domains are the most sensitive to ozonation, which causes local conformational changes in them. On one hand, these changes inhibit the reaction of longitudinal polymerization of monomeric fibrin molecules; on the other hand, they expose reaction centers responsible for self-assembly of fibrinogen clusters.",6.3.3,Toxicology,0,0

However, nothing is known about its potential effects against other environmental sources of oxidative stress such as ozone (O3) in skin. Intake of oral beta-carotene supplements before exposure to sunlight (and thus inevitably also to (O3) has been recommended on a population-wide basis. However, although some studies have shown beta-carotene as providing skin protection as an antioxidant, other studies using skin cells in culture have shown that beta-carotene may have unexpected prooxidant properties (Obermuller-Jevic, et al., 2001). Given this, there is an ongoing debate regarding the protective or potentially harmful role(s) of beta-carotene in human skin. In this study, the effect of beta-carotene on ozone's effects on the skin of hairless mice was assessed. After feeding a diet supplemented with 0.5% beta-carotene for 1 month, mice were subjected to O3 exposure (0.8 ppm 6 h/day; 7 days) and the induction of proinflammatory markers such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFalpha), macrophage inflammatory protein 2 (MIP2), and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), and markers of oxidative stress, heme-oxygenase-1 (HO-1), were quantitated. The data showed that beta-carotene downregulated the induction of TNFalpha, MIP2, iNOS, and HO-1 in response to O3.

Few studies examined associations between air pollution and emergency room (ER) visits for wheezing, and even fewer for gastroenteric illness. We conducted a multicity analysis of the relationship between air pollution and ER visits for wheezing and gastroenteric disorder in children 0?2 years of age.

Methods: We obtained ER visit records for wheezing and gastroenteric disorder from six Italian cities. A city-specific case?crossover analysis was applied to estimate effects of particulate matter (PM), nitrogen dioxide, sulfur dioxide, ozone, and carbon monoxide, adjusting for immediate and delayed effects of temperature. Lagged effects of air pollutants up to 6 prior days were examined. The city-specific results were combined using a random-effect meta-analysis.

Results: CO and SO2 were most strongly associated with wheezing, with a 2.7% increase [95% confidence interval (CI), 0.5?4.9] for a 1.04-?g/m3 increase in 7-day average CO and a 3.4% (95% CI, 1.5?5.3) increase for an 8.0-?g/m3 increase in SO2. Positive associations were also found for PM with aerodynamic diameter ? 10 ?g and NO2. We found a significant association between the 3-day moving average CO and gastroenteric disorders [3.8% increase (95% CI, 1.0?6.8)]. When data were stratified by season, the associations were stronger in summer for wheezing and in winter for gastroenteric disorders.

Conclusion: Air pollution is associated with triggering of wheezing and gastroenteric disorders in children 0?2 years of age; more work is needed to understand the mechanisms to help prevent wheezing in children.

Although the gestational age of interest is often early pregnancy, maternal addresses are not available for women who move during pregnancy when using maternal addresses abstracted from birth certificates. The aim of this study was to explore the extent of ambient air pollutant exposure misclassification due to maternal residential mobility during pregnancy among the subgroup of a New York birth cohort. The authors obtained the maternal addresses at birth from the New York Birth Certificate, and the maternal addresses by gestational age from the National Birth Defect Prevention Study for New York participants for the study period 1997-2002. Among the 1324 mothers, 172 (13.0%) moved once during pregnancy and 46 (3.5%) moved at least twice. When accounting for multiple addresses among some individuals, of the 218 mothers who moved, 38 (2.9%) moved in the 3rd to 8th weeks after conception (critical period, not exclusive from the 1st trimester), 80 (6.0%) moved in the 1st trimester, 112 (8.5%) in the 2nd trimester, and 51 (3.9%) in the 3rd trimester. Air monitoring data from the New York Department of Environmental Conservation were used as surrogates to compute the ambient ozone and PM(10) exposures for mothers with complete residential data. This study estimates exposure using maternal address at birth obtained from birth certificates, compared to exposure estimates when using maternal addresses by gestational age obtained from maternal interview, the gold standard. Average exposures during pregnancy were similar when using interview based versus birth certificate addresses (0.035 vs. 0.035 ppm for ozone, and 20.11 vs. 20.09 microg/m(3) for PM(10), respectively). Kappa statistics and percent agreement were calculated to measure the degree of agreement for dichotomous exposure measurements (<median vs.>=median) and weighted kappa for quartile exposure measurements by gestational age. All the statistics indicated a high agreement between the two measurements. For mothers who moved, the majority maintained their address in the same exposure region. Given the low mobility during pregnancy and the short distance moved, the exposure assignment did not change substantially when using the more accurate interview based addresses in this study.

BALB/c mice (n = 5/cohort) were exposed to ozone (100 ppb) or forced air (FA) for 4 hours. MARCKS-inhibiting peptides, MANS, BIO-11000, BIO-11006, or scrambled control peptide RNS, were intratracheally administered prior to ozone exposure.

Male BALB/c mice were sensitized ip with ovalbumin (Ova) or vehicle only, then exposed once per week for 4 wk via nose-only inhalation (4 h) to the PM(2.5) fraction of DEP (2 mg/m(3)), O(3) (0.5 ppm), DEP and O(3), or filtered air, and then challenged with aerosolized ovalbumin. Ova sensitization in air-exposed mice enhanced pulmonary inflammatory cell infiltration, several indicators of injury in the lung (lactate dehydrogenase, albumin and total protein), and lung resistance (R(L)) and elastance (E(L)) in response to methacholine (MCh) aerosol challenge. DEP exposure did not enhance the Ova-induced increase in pulmonary cell infiltration, indicators of injury, or R(L) and E(L). O(3) exposure enhanced the Ova-induced increase in inflammatory cell infiltration and N-acetylglucosaminidase (NAG) in the lung, but had no effect on R(L) or E(L).

STUDY DESIGN: Ecological longitudinal time-series study. METHODS: The dependent variable used was the daily number of emergency hospital admissions registered at the Gregorio Maranon University Teaching Hospital. The following causes were analysed: all causes [International Classification of Diseases 9th Version (ICD-9:1-799)], respiratory causes (ICD-9: 460-519) and circulatory causes (ICD-9: 390-459). Analysis focused on subjects over 75 years of age. Daily records of mean concentrations of PM(2.5), PM(10), NO(2), NO(x), SO(2) and O(3) in Madrid were used as independent variables. The control variables were seasonalities, trend, influenza epidemics, noise and pollen concentrations. Poisson regression models were constructed to calculate the relative risk (RR) and attributable risk (AR). Analyses were performed for the entire year and for the winter and summer. RESULTS: PM(2.5) was the single primary pollutant that proved statistically significant in all models. The functional relationship with hospital admissions was linear and had no threshold. Taking the year as a whole, the RRs among people over 75 years of age for an increase of 10 microg/m(3) in PM(2.5) concentrations were: 1.038 [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.022-1.053] for all causes at lag 0; 1.062 (95% CI 1.036-1.089) for circulatory causes at lag 0; and 1.049 (95% CI 1.019-1.078) for respiratory causes at lag 3. The ARs were 3.6%, 5.9% and 4.6%, respectively. These risks increased in winter and no statistically significant associations were observed in summer.

Methods: Daily admissions of ischemic (n = 11,267) and hemorrhagic (n = 1,681) stroke were obtained from a Swedish quality register for stroke, Riks-Stroke. We used two types of exposure data: (1) daily measured background levels of ozone, temperature and particles with a diameter <10 mum (PM(10)) and (2) modeled levels of a mixture of NO and NO(2) (NO(x)) at the residential address of each individual. Results: We estimated a 13% (95% confidence interval, 4-22%) increased risk for hospital admissions for ischemic stroke for levels of PM(10) above 30 mug/m(3) compared to <15 mug/m(3), whereas temperature above 16 degrees C decreased the risk.

Ambient fine particles (particular matter <2.5 ?m diameter [PM2.5]) and ozone exacerbate respiratory conditions including asthma. There is little documentation determining whether children are more vulnerable to the effects of ambient pollution than adults, or whether pollution causes life-threatening episodes requiring intensive care unit (ICU) admission.

Objective
We investigate the relationship between severe asthma morbidity and PM2.5 and ozone in the warm season, and determine whether there is an age-related susceptibility to pollution.

Methods
Daily time-series analysis of 6008 asthma ICU admissions and 69,375 general (non-ICU) asthma admissions in 4 age groups (<6, 6-18, 19-49, and 50+ years) in 74 New York City hospitals for the months April to August from 1999 to 2006. The regression model adjusted for temporal trends, weather, and day of the week. Risks were estimated for interquartile range increases in the a priori exposure time window of the average of 0-day and 1-day lagged pollutants.

Results
Age was a significant effect modifier for hospitalizations, and children age 6 to 18 years consistently had the highest risk. Among children age 6 to 18 years, there was a 26% (95% CI, 10% to 44%) increased rate of ICU admissions and a 19% increased rate of general hospitalizations (95% CI, 12% to 27%) for each 12-?g/m3 increase in PM2.5. For each 22-ppb increase in ozone, there was a 19% (95% CI, 1% to 40%) increased risk for ICU admissions and a 20% (95% CI, 11% to 29%) increased risk for general hospitalizations.

Although it can be expected that reductions in air pollutants are associated with reductions in health effects, it is unclear whether this is actually the case. The purpose of this analysis was to compare the levels of and relationships between air pollutants and acute respiratory outpatient visits for two consecutive time periods totaling 53 mo. Air pollution data were collected at a centrally located monitor in Atlanta, GA, and include 24-hr averages of particulate matter (PM) less than 2.5 ?m in aerodynamic diameter (PM2.5) and its components; coarse PM (PM<sub>10-2.5</sub>); PM less than 10 ?m in aerodynamic diameter (PM<sub>10</sub>); oxygenated volatile organic compounds (OVOCs); 8-hr maximum ozone (O<sub>3</sub>); and 1-hr maximum nitrogen dioxide (NO<sub>2</sub>), carbon monoxide (CO), and sulfur dioxide (SO<sub>2</sub>). In addition, several metals and fractions of elemental carbon (EC) and organic carbon (OC) were investigated. Daily outpatient visit data were obtained from the electronic data warehouse of the Atlanta-based region of a nonprofit managed care organization. Poisson general linear modeling determined associations between daily levels of acute visits for four diagnosis groups (adult and child asthma, upper and lower respiratory infection) and air pollution measurements. Overall declining trends were observed in air pollutants and acute visits over the study period. Childhood asthma had the greatest number of significant associations with air pollutants, namely zinc and EC. The significant lag time between pollutant measurement and visit occurrence changed from 3-5 days in the first time period to 6-8 days in the later time period, but there was general consistency in several childhood asthma and pollutant associations over both time periods. The greatest evidence for a reduction in pollution being associated with an improvement in health response was for lower respiratory disease visits, but even in this case changes in other factors that influence health responses make it difficult to demonstrate that changes in pollutant levels influence health outcomes.

Although the present levels of ozone may not induce visible symptoms in most of the plants, they can result in substantial production losses and reproductive output. There are wide variations in ozone sensitivity among varieties in same species. This paper reports variations in ozone sensitivity for two tropical soybean (Glycine max L.) varieties (PK 472 and Bragg) exposed to projected elevated ozone concentrations of 70 and 100ppb for 4h daily from germination to maturity under natural field conditions. Differential sensitivities of cultivars to ozone were assessed by comparing the levels of antioxidative potential, metabolite production, growth behaviour, biomass accumulation and yield responses. The activity of catalase decreased whereas peroxidase increased in both the varieties upon exposure to O sub(3), however, the magnitude of change was always higher in PK 472 as compared to Bragg. The larger magnitude of reductions in the levels of antioxidants, metabolites and nutrients also reflected the greater sensitivity of PK 472 compared to Bragg. The differential response of biochemical characteristics corresponded to significant reductions in plant length, number and area of leaves, component-wise biomass and yield parameters of PK 472 as compared to Bragg. This work emphasizes the greater sensitivity of a newly developed variety PK 472 of soybean compared to that of the older variety, Bragg. Further, the effects of ozone on different plant characteristics were found to be more prominent during reproductive than vegetative growth in these two varieties. In view of the anticipated increasing tropospheric O sub(3) concentrations the in near future, the results of the present study can be utilized in screening out more resistant varieties of soybean for greater agricultural productivity.",9.3.4.2,Role of Antioxidants in Plant Defense Responses,0,0

We undertook new meta-analyses of existing time-series studies and an analysis of a cohort of 352[punctuation space]000 people in 66 US cities during 18 years of follow-up. This cohort study provides estimates of mortality effects from long-term exposure to elemental carbon, an indicator of black carbon mass, and evidence that ozone exerts an independent risk of mortality. Associations among these pollutants make drawing conclusions about their individual health effects difficult at present, but sulphate seems to have the most robust effects in multiple-pollutant models. Generally, the toxicology of the pure compounds and their epidemiology diverge because atmospheric black carbon, ozone, and sulphate are associated and could interact with related toxic species. Although sulphate is a cooling agent, black carbon and ozone could together exert nearly half as much global warming as carbon dioxide. The complexity of these health and climate effects needs to be recognised in mitigation policies.",7.7,Mortality,0,0

Interleukin-6 (IL-6) and fibrinogen are biomarkers of systemic inflammation that are independent risk factors for cardio-vascular disease.

OBJECTIVE: We investigated the association between ambient air pollution and systemic inflammation using baseline measurements of IL-6 and fibrinogen from controlled human exposure studies.

METHODS: In this retrospective analysis we used repeated-measures data in 45 nonsmoking subjects. Hourly and daily moving averages were calculated for ozone, nitrogen dioxide, sulfur dioxide, and particulate matter <or= 2.5 microm in aerodynamic diameter (PM2.5). Linear mixed-model regression determined the effects of the pollutants on systemic IL-6 and fibrinogen. Effect modification by season was considered.

RESULTS: We observed a positive association between IL-6 and O3 [0.31 SD per O3 interquartile range (IQR); 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.080.54] and between IL-6 and SO2 (0.25 SD per SO2 IQR; 95% CI, 0.060.43). We observed the strongest effects using 4-day moving averages. Responses to pollutants varied by season and tended to be higher in the summer, particularly for O3 and PM2.5. Fibrinogen was not associated with pollution.

CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates a significant association between ambient pollutant levels and baseline levels of systemic IL-6. These findings have potential implications for controlled human exposure studies. Future research should consider whether ambient pollution exposure before chamber exposure modifies IL-6 response.",6.3.2.4,Biomarkers,4.1.11.1,Epidemiologic Panel Studies

Here, we used meta-analysis combined with pairwise techniques to examine root mass fraction (RMF; i.e., the fraction of root to total biomass) as affected by elevated CO(2) and environmental stresses. Our results showed that lower soil fertility increased RMF and the magnitude was similar for ambient and elevated CO(2)-grown plants. Lower soil water also increased RMF, but to a greater extent at elevated than at ambient CO(2). While CO(2) enrichment had little effect on the magnitude of O(3)-caused reduction in RMF in herbaceous species, it alleviated the adverse effect of higher O(3) on root production in woody species. These results demonstrate that CO(2) has less pronounced effects on RMF than other environmental factors. Under abiotic stresses, e.g., drought and higher O(3), elevated CO(2)-grown plants will likely increase biomass allocation below-ground. Because of the non-uniform changes in drought and O(3) projected for different parts of the world, we conclude that elevated CO(2) will have regional, but not global, effects on biomass allocation under various global change scenarios.",9.4.3.1,Plant Growth and Biomass Allocation,0,0

The aim of this study was to determine whether Mediterranean seasonal changes in temperature, humidity or airborne pollutants affect the airway cells of runners training outdoors in an urban environment. In nine male amateur runners, cell composition, apoptosis, and inflammatory mediators were measured in induced sputum collected at rest (baseline) and the morning after races held in the fall (21 km), winter (12 km), and summer (10 km). Concentrations of air pollutants were below the alert threshold at all times. Neutrophil differential counts tended to increase after all races (P = 0.055). Apoptosis of neutrophils increased with ozone (P < 0.005) and particulate matter <10 microm (PM10) (P < 0.05) exposure. Bronchial epithelial cell counts were low at all times and weakly correlated with ozone and PM10 concentrations. Apoptotic bronchial epithelial cells increased after all races (P < 0.05). Inflammatory mediators in induced sputum were low at baseline and after the races, and correlated with neutrophil differential counts only at rest. In conclusion, apoptosis of airway cells in runners appears to be affected by both exercise and environmental conditions. Apoptosis of neutrophils increased with exposure to environmental pollutants while apoptosis of bronchial epithelial cells increased after intense exercise. Since no relationship was observed between neutrophil counts and inflammatory mediators 20 h after races, airways inflammation at this time point appears blunted in healthy runners and little affected by exposure to mild seasonal changes and airborne pollutants.",6.2.3.2,Epidemiology,0,0

Since cerebellar morphologic disruptions have been reported with prenatal O3 exposure, O3 may have an effect on some neurotransmitter systems, such as monoamines. In order to test this hypothesis, we used 60 male rats taken from either, mothers exposed to 1 ppm of O3 during the entire pregnancy, or from mothers breathing filtered and clean air during pregnancy. The cerebellum was extracted at 0, 5, and 10 postnatal days. Tissues were processed in order to analyze by HPLC, dopamine (DA) levels, 3,4 dihydroxyphenilacetic acid (DOPAC) and homovanillic acid (HVA), norepinephrine (NA), serotonin, and 5-hydroxy-indole-acetic acid (5-HIAA) contents. Results showed a decrease of DA, NA, DOPAC and HVA mainly in 0 and 5 postnatal days. There were no changes in 5-HT levels, and 5-HIAA showed an increase after 10 postnatal days. DOPAC + HVA/DA ratio showed changes in 0 and 10 postnatal days, while 5-HIAA/5-HT ratio showed a slight decrease in 0 days. The data suggest that prenatal O3 exposure disrupts the cerebellar catecholamine system rather than the indole-amine system. Disruptions in cerebellar NA could lead to ataxic symptoms and also could limit recovery after cortical brain damage in adults.

Methods: Eligible subjects were SJV residents (CHIS 2001) who reported physician-diagnosed asthma (n=1,502, 14.6%). We considered two outcomes indicative of uncontrolled asthma: (1) daily or weekly asthma symptoms, and (2) asthma-related ED visits or hospitalization in the past year.

Additionally, a significant increase in the percentage of sperm cells with cytoplasmic drop [beta = 2.64; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.215.06] and abnormal head (beta = 0.47; 95% CI, 0.030.92) was associated with PM2.5 concentration in the base model. However, these associations, along with all other sperm outcomes, were not significantly associated with either pollutant after controlling for season and temperature. Overall, although we found both protective and adverse effects, there was generally no consistent pattern of increased abnormal sperm quality with elevated exposure to O3 or PM2.5.Conclusions: Exposures to O3 or PM2.5 at levels below the current National Ambient Air Quality Standards were not associated with statistically significant decrements in sperm outcomes in this cohort of fertile men. However, some results suggested effects on sperm concentration, count, and morphology. Editor's SummaryAdverse effects of air pollution on sperm quality have been reported, but few studies have evaluated ambient exposures consistent with U.S. regulatory guidelines. Hansen et al. (p. 203) studied levels of ozone (O3) and PM2.5 (particulate matter < 2.5 microm in aerodynamic diameter) in association with semen outcomes among 228 presumed-fertile men residing in three southeastern U.S. counties. Exposures were classified based on measurements averaged across fixed monitoring stations in each county during the 90 days before sample collection. Outcomes included sperm concentration, count (per ejaculate) and morphology, and proxy measures of DNA integrity (sperm chromatin structure assay) and chromatin maturity (CMA assay). Associations with exposures during key time windows of sperm development were estimated using multivariable linear regression. The authors report crude inverse associations for O3 and sperm concentration and count, and positive associations for PM2.5 and the proportion of sperm cells with cytoplasmic drop and abnormal heads; however, associations did not persist after adjustment for season and temperature. Overall, O3 and PM2.5 exposures in the study population were not clearly associated with adverse outcomes, but the authors conclude that better characterized exposure estimates are needed to clarify relations between air pollutants and sperm quality.",7.4.1,Effects on Sperm ,7.1.5,Summary and Causality Determinations

Outdoor air pollution is a recognized asthma trigger, but it is unclear whether exposure influences incident disease. We investigated the effect of exposure to ambient air pollution in utero and during the first year of life on risk of subsequent asthma diagnosis in a population-based nested casecontrol study.Methods: We assessed all children born in southwestern British Columbia in 1999 and 2000 (n = 37,401) for incidence of asthma diagnosis up to 34 years of age using outpatient and hospitalization records. Asthma cases were age- and sex-matched to five randomly chosen controls from the eligible cohort. We estimated each individual's exposure to ambient air pollution for the gestational period and first year of life using high-resolution pollution surfaces derived from regulatory monitoring data as well as land use regression models adjusted for temporal variation. We used logistic regression analyses to estimate effects of carbon monoxide, nitric oxide, nitrogen dioxide, particulate matter </= 10 microm and </= 2.5 microm in aerodynamic diameter (PM10 and PM2.5), ozone, sulfur dioxide, black carbon, woodsmoke, and proximity to roads and point sources on asthma diagnosis.Results: A total of 3,482 children (9%) were classified as asthma cases. We observed a statistically significantly increased risk of asthma diagnosis with increased early life exposure to CO, NO, NO2, PM10, SO2, and black carbon and proximity to point sources. Traffic-related pollutants were associated with the highest risks: adjusted odds ratio = 1.08 (95% confidence interval, 1.041.12) for a 10-microg/m3 increase of NO, 1.12 (1.071.17) for a 10-microg/m3 increase in NO2, and 1.10 (1.061.13) for a 100-microg/m3 increase in CO. These data support the hypothesis that early childhood exposure to air pollutants plays a role in development of asthma. Editor's SummaryAir pollution has been consistently associated with asthma symptoms, but relatively few studies have evaluated early life exposures and asthma onset. Clark et al. (p. 284) conducted a nested population-based casecontrol study of childhood asthma diagnosed up to 34 years of age among children born in southwestern British Columbia in 1999 and 2000, including 3,482 eligible cases (with a history of hospitalization or at least two asthma diagnoses) and 17,410 age- and sex-matched controls. Administrative and health care data were used to identify eligible children and obtain information on residential histories and potential confounders. Air pollution exposures during pregnancy and the first year of life [specifically, to carbon monoxide, nitric oxide, nitrogen dioxide, particulate matter </= 10 microm (PM10) and </= 2.5 microm (PM2.5) in aerodynamic diameter, ozone, sulfur dioxide, black carbon, woodsmoke, and proximity to major roads and industrial point sources] were estimated using regulatory monitoring data and land use regression models adjusted for temporal variation. Early life exposures to CO, NO, NO2, PM10, SO2, black carbon, and industrial point sources were positively associated with asthma, with the strongest associations noted for traffic-related pollutants. The authors conclude that results support effects of early exposure to air pollutants on the development of childhood asthma.",7.2.1.2,Prevalence of Asthma and Asthma Symptoms,0,0

OBJECTIVE: To determine the factors associated with oxidative stress including asthma severity and the genotype of the antioxidant enzymes. METHODS: A total of 196 children with mild asthma, 116 children with moderate-severe asthma, and 2 healthy control groups (187 and 68 children) were included in the study. Plasma levels of malondialdehyde were measured as the indicator of oxidative stress, and reduced glutathione levels as the indicator of antioxidant defense. Children were genotyped for null variants of glutathione S transferase (GST) T1 and GSTM1, and ile105val variant of GSTP1. Risk factors were analyzed with multivariate logistic regression. RESULTS: Systemic levels of malondialdehyde increased and reduced glutathione levels decreased significantly from healthy controls to patients with mild asthma and then to patients with moderate-severe asthma (P < .001 for each). Multivariate logistic regression identified asthma and asthma severity as independent factors associated with oxidative stress (odds ratio between 17 and 56; P < .001). Children with asthma with GSTP1 val/val genotype had higher malondialdehyde and lower glutathione levels compared with other genotypes (P = .023 and P = .014, respectively). GSTP1 val/val genotype was independently associated with asthma severity (odds ratio, 4.210; 95% CI, 1.581-11.214; P = .004). CONCLUSION: Our study indicates the presence of a strong oxidative stress in children with asthma that increases with the severity of the disease. In this population, val/val genotype at GSTP1 ile105val locus may be an important factor in determining the degree of oxidant injury. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: Children with asthma with val/val genotype at GSTP1 ile105val locus may be good candidates for supplemental antioxidant therapy.",7.2.1.1,New Onset Asthma,0,0

The aim of this study was to measure the association between chronic exposure to outdoor air pollutants and adult lung function.

Methods: The relationship between measures of lung function (forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1) and FEV1 as a percentage of forced vital capacity (FVC)) and average exposure to particulate matter ,10 mm in diameter, nitrogen dioxide, sulfur dioxide and ozone was examined in four representative cross-sectional surveys of the English population aged >16 in 1995, 1996, 1997 and 2001. Year-specific estimates were pooled using fixed effects meta-analysis.

Results: Greater exposure to particulate matter ,10 mm in diameter, nitrogen dioxide and sulfur dioxide was associated with lower adult FEV1. The size of the effect on population mean FEV1 was about 3% for particulate matter ,10 mm, and 0.7% for nitrogen dioxide and sulfur dioxide, for a 10 mg/m3 increase in pollutant concentration. The effects were most marked in men, older adults and ex-smokers. FEV1 was not associated with ozone concentration. No associations were found between the pollutants and FEV1 as a percentage of FVC.

A multi-year study was conducted in outdoor sunlit-controlled environment mesocosm containing ponderosa pine seedlings growing in a reconstructed soil-litter system. The study used a 2 x 2 factorial design with two concentrations of CO2 (ambient and elevated), two levels of O-3 (low and high) and three replicates of each treatment. The objective of this study was to assess the effects of chronic exposure to elevated CO2 and O-3, alone and in combination, on daily ET. This study evaluated three hypotheses: (i) because elevated CO2 stimulates stomatal closure, O-3 effects on ET will be less under elevated CO2 than under ambient CO2; (ii) elevated CO2 will ameliorate the long-term effects of O-3 on ET; and (iii) because conductance (g) decreases with decreasing SM, the impacts of elevated CO2 and O-3, alone and in combination, on water loss via g will be greater in early summer when SM is not limiting than to other times of the year. A mixed-model covariance analysis was used to adjust the daily ET for seasonality and the effects of SM and photosynthetically active radiation when testing for the effects of CO2 and O-3 on ET via the vapor pressure deficit gradient. The empirical results indicated that the interactive stresses of elevated CO2 and O-3 resulted in a lesser reduction in ET via reduced canopy conductance than the sum of the individual effects of each gas. CO2-induced reductions in ET were more pronounced when trees were physiologically most active. O-3-induced reductions in ET under ambient CO2 were likely transpirational changes via reduced conductance because needle area and root biomass were not affected by exposures to elevated O-3 in this study.",9.2.3,Field Chambers,8.1.2.1.2,Field Chambers

To investigate the ozone responsiveness of trees, we carried out a microarray analysis of beech saplings, grown around a free air lysimeter station in the years 2005 and 2006. The microarrays revealed ozone-responsive expressed sequence tags (ESTs), derived from a suppression subtractive hybridisation cDNA library. Chronic ozone exposure effects were investigated at different time points throughout the whole vegetation period in 2005 and 2006. Significantly regulated ESTs were calculated with R-packages. Different transcript patterns in both years could be related to weather conditions and consequential a different ozone uptake. Fewer transcriptome changes were found in 2005 compared to 2006. Induction of ESTs involved in cell structure, related to stress response and cell walls, signal transduction, as well as disease and defence in July and August indicated ozone-related stress responses in both years.

However, few studies provide a complete analysis of the factors and interactions that affect carbon dynamics over a large landscape. This study examines how changes in atmospheric composition (CO2, O-3 and N deposition), climate and land-use affected carbon dynamics and sequestration in Mid-Atlantic temperate forests during the 20th century. We modified and applied the PnET-CN model, a well established process-based ecosystem model with a strong foundation of ecosystem knowledge from experimental studies. We validated the model results using the U.S. Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) data. Our results suggest that chronic changes in atmospheric chemistry over the past century markedly affected carbon dynamics and sequestration in Mid-Atlantic temperate forests, while climate change only had a minor impact although inter-annual climatic variability had a far more substantial effect. The NPP response to a century of chronic change in atmospheric composition at the regional scale was an increase of 29%, of which, 14% was from elevated CO2, 17% from N deposition, 6% from the interaction between CO2 and N deposition, and minus 8% from tropospheric ozone. Climate change increased NPP by only 4%. Disturbed forests had 6% lower NPP than undisturbed forests after seven decades. Regrowing forests after harvesting and natural disturbances had much greater capacity for sequestering carbon than undisturbed old-growth forests even though the newer forests had slightly lower net primary production (NPP). The modeling results indicated that N deposition was a stronger force than elevated CO2 for increasing NPP and fast turnover tissues, while elevated CO2 favored more sustainable carbon storage and sequestration. The model results are consistent with various experiments and observations and demonstrate a powerful approach to integrate and expand our knowledge of complex interactive effects of multiple environmental changes on forest carbon dynamics.

On the other hand, neuronal activity recorded in the cholinoceptive hypothalamic medial preoptic area (MPO) has been involved in the regulation of sleep. However, there is no direct evidence on the role that acetylcholine (Ach) release in the MPO plays in the sleep-wake cycle. In order to study this relation, we measured the Ach concentration in dialysates collected from MPO in rats exposed to coal-filtered air (clean air) for 48 h and in rats exposed to clean air for 24 h followed by 24-h of O3 exposure to 0.5 ppm. Polygraphic sleep records were taken simultaneously to neurochemical sampling. O3 was employed to disrupt the sleep-wake cycle and relate these changes with concomitant disruptions in Ach concentration dialyzed from MPO. A clear circadian pattern of Ach concentration was observed in dialysates from MPO and also in PS, SWS and wakefulness of rats exposed to filtered air. However, O3 exposure decreased the PS by 65% (Mann-Whitney's U-test, p<or=0.0003) and a concomitant decrease of extracellular Ach of 58% (p<or=0.0239) was observed during the light phase. These changes were maintained during the dark phase, although it was also observed that slow-wave sleep increased by 75% (p<or=0.0013) while wakefulness was decreased in 35% (p<or=0.0007). We conclude that Ach release in MPO follows a circadian rhythm that is disrupted by O3 exposure, and these changes are strongly associated with the O3-induced PS disruptions.",6.4,Central Nervous System Effects ,0,0

The long-term effects of prenatal O3 exposure in rats (0.5 ppm 12 h/day from embryonic day E5 to E20) were evaluated in the adult nucleus tractus solitarius (NTS) regulating respiratory control. Neuronal response was assessed by Fos protein immunolabeling (Fos-IR), and catecholaminergic neuron involvement by tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) labeling (TH-IR). Adult offspring were analyzed at baseline and following immobilization stress (one hour, plus two hours' recovery); immunolabeling was observed by confocal microscopy. Prenatal O3 increased the baseline TH gray level per cell (p < 0.001). In contrast, the number of Fos-IR cells, Fos-IR/TH-IR colabeled cells and proportion of TH double-labeled with Fos remained unchanged. After stress, the TH gray level (p < 0.001), number of Fos-IR cells (p < 0.001) and of colabeled Fos-IR/TH-IR cells (p < 0.05) and percentage of colabeled Fos-IR/TH-IR neurons against TH-IR cells (p < 0.05) increased in the control group. In prenatal-O3 rats, immobilization stress abolished these increases and reduced the TH gray level (p < 0.05), indicating that prenatal O3 led to loss of adult NTS reactivity to stress.

To address this hypothesis, pulmonary responses to crystalline silica, a particulate with oxidant properties, were evaluated in normal or hyperthyroid adult male rats. To induce a hyperthyroid condition, time-release pellets containing thyroxine were implanted subcutaneously; control rats received placebo pellets. After 7 days, the animals were exposed to saline or silica (0.1mg/100g BW or 1.0mg/100g BW) by intratracheal instillation. Following silica treatment, there was a dose-related increase in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) albumin levels and neutrophil numbers. However, the effects of silica were similar in both normal and hyperthyroid rats. These findings were confirmed and contrasted with those regarding ozone (1ppm, 4h inhalation) in a subsequent experiment. The results indicated that, although exposure to either ozone or silica resulted in increases in BAL albumin levels and neutrophil numbers, only responses to ozone were enhanced in hyperthyroid rats. These findings suggest that specificity exists in regards to the modulation of oxidant-induced lung damage and inflammation by thyroid hormones.",8.2.6,Hyperthyroidism,0,0

In the present study, we investigated the concentration-dependency of the effects of exposure to O(3) on the aggravation of nasal allergy-like reactions induced by repeated nasal administration of antigen. Guinea pigs were exposed to filtered air or 0.1-0.6 ppm O(3) for 5 weeks. After each weekly administration of ovalbumin (OVA), sneezes and nasal secretions were measured. The number of eosinophils infiltrating the nasal septum and the titers of OVA-specific antibody were measured 24h after the last administration. Ozone increased sneezing and nasal secretion induced by OVA, nasal responsiveness to physical stimuli, and the number of infiltrating eosinophils in a concentration-dependent manner. The titer of anti-OVA-IgG was increased in animals exposed to 0.6 ppm O(3). Thus, exposure to O(3) aggravated nasal allergy-like symptoms concentration dependently. The aggravation was caused by induction of nasal hyperresponsiveness, the infiltration of eosinophils, and the increase in the production of anti-OVA-IgG. The estimated maximum likelihood estimation concentrations (MLECs) and bench mark concentrations (BMCs) of O(3) for these indices were in the range of 0.09-0.18 and 0.02-0.06 ppm, respectively.",7.2.5,Allergic Responses,0,0

Eosinophil profiles were increased by allergen/ozone in both proximal and distal airways, an effect that was decreased by ICS in distal airways. In both allergen/ozone- and air-exposed monkeys, ICS increased the number of alveolar attachments in distal airways, decreased mucin in proximal airways and decreased epithelial volume in both airways. ICS increased smooth muscle in air-exposed animals while decreasing it in allergen/ozone-exposed animals in both airways. In proximal airways, there was a small but significant positive correlation between smooth muscle and airway responsiveness, as well as between alveolar attachments and responsiveness.

The purpose of this study was to determine the role of IL-1RI in pulmonary responses to O(3.) To that end, wild-type, C57BL/6 (IL-1RI(+/+)) mice and IL-1RI-deficient (IL-1RI(-/-)) mice were exposed to O(3) either subacutely (0.3 ppm for 72 h) or acutely (2 ppm for 3 h). Subacute O(3) exposure increased bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) protein, interferon-gamma-inducible protein (IP)-10, soluble tumor necrosis factor receptor 1 (sTNFR1), and neutrophils in IL-1RI(+/+) and IL-1RI(-/-) mice. With the exception of IP-10, all outcome indicators were reduced in IL-1RI(-/-) mice. Furthermore, subacute O(3) exposure increased IL-6 mRNA expression in IL-1RI(+/+), but not IL-1RI(-/-) mice.

For IL-6, eotaxin, MIP-2, and sTNFR1, there were small but significant reductions of these outcome indicators in IL-1RI(-/-) versus IL-1RI(+/+) mice at 6 hours after exposure, but not at other time points, whereas other outcome indicators were unaffected by IL-1RI deficiency. These results suggest that IL-1RI is required for O(3)-induced pulmonary inflammation during subacute O(3) exposure, but plays a more minor role during acute O(3) exposure.

Mice were exposed to 0.8 parts/million ozone for 8 h, and we examined a wide range of biological parameters in the lung at the gene expression, protein, and cellular level 4 h after the ozone exposure.

The bronchoalveolar lavage fluid showed significantly more tumor necrosis factor-alpha in repair-deficient Csb(-/-) mice than in repair-proficient Csb(+/-) mice after ozone exposure. In addition, a clear trend was observed toward fewer differentially expressed genes with a lower fold ratio in repair-deficient Csb(-/-) mice than in repair-proficient Csb(+/-) mice. However, repair-deficient Csb(-/-) mice do not respond significantly more sensitively to ozone compared with repair-proficient Csb(+/-) mice at the level of gene expression.

The pollutants decreased recovery of alveolar macrophages in tavage fluid of both wild-type and TNF mice (exposure main effect, p < .001).

The mechanisms underlying this systemic response to ozone have not been previously elucidated. We have applied the technique of global gene expression analysis to the livers of C57BL mice acutely exposed to ozone. Mice lost up to 14% of their original body weight, with a 42% decrease in total food consumption. We previously had found significant up-regulation of genes encoding proliferative enzymes, proteins related to acute phase reactions and cytoskeletal functions, and other biomarkers of a cachexia-like inflammatory state in lungs of mice exposed to ozone. These results are consistent with a general up-regulation of different gene families responsive to NF-kappaB in the lungs of the exposed mice. In the present study, we observed significant down-regulation of different families of mRNAs in the livers of the exposed mice, including genes related to lipid and fatty acid metabolism, and to carbohydrate metabolism in this tissue, consistent with a systemic cachexic response. Several interferon-dependent genes were down-regulated in the liver, suggesting a possible role for interferon as a signaling molecule between lung and liver. In addition, transcription of several mRNAs encoding enzymes of xenobiotic metabolism in the livers of mice exposed to ozone was decreased, suggesting cytokine-mediated suppression of cytochrome P450 expression.

Results: Allergy parameters were significantly higher in

Possible mechanisms include autonomic cardiac dysfunction.Methods: In a repeated-measures study of 46 patients 4375 years of age, we investigated associations of central-site ambient particulate pollution, including black carbon (BC) (a marker for regional and local traffic), and report of traffic exposure with changes in half-hourly averaged heart rate variability (HRV), a marker of autonomic function measured by 24-hr Holter electrocardiogram monitoring. Each patient was observed up to four times within 1 year after a percutaneous intervention for myocardial infarction, acute coronary syndrome without infarction, or stable coronary artery disease (4,955 half-hour observations). For each half-hour period, diary data defined whether the patient was home or not home, or in traffic.Results: A decrease in high frequency (HF; an HRV marker of vagal tone) of 16.4% [95% confidence interval (CI), 20.7 to 11.8%] was associated with an interquartile range of 0.3-microg/m3 increase in prior 5-day averaged ambient BC. Decreases in HF were independently associated both with the previous 2-hr averaged BC (10.4%; 95% CI, 15.4 to 5.2%) and with being in traffic in the previous 2 hr (38.5%; 95% CI, 57.4 to 11.1%). We also observed independent responses for particulate air matter with aerodynamic diameter </= 2.5 microm and for gases (ozone or nitrogen dioxide).Conclusion: After hospitalization for coronary artery disease, both particulate pollution and being in traffic, a marker of stress and pollution, were associated with decreased HRV. Editor's SummaryReduced heart rate variability (HRV) has been associated with myocardial infarction and mortality in heart failure patients, and acute decreases in HRV have been reported to precede ischemic events and paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. Associations of particulate matter (PM) and traffic-related air pollution with myocardial infarction and cardiac mortality may be related to effects on HRV, but inconsistent findings of previous studies suggest that susceptibility to effects of pollution on HRV may vary. Zanobetti et al. (p. 324) estimated associations between ambient air pollution [PM and black carbon (BC) measured at a central site], self-reported traffic exposure, and several markers of HRV (measured by Holter electrocardiogram monitoring over 24 hr) among 46 patients observed up to four times within the year following percutaneous intervention for myocardial infarction, acute coronary syndrome without infarction, or stable coronary artery disease. The authors report a decrease in high frequency measures with an increase in prior 5-day averaged ambient BC, increased BC within the previous 2 hr, and being in traffic within the previous 2 hr. Model estimates also suggested independent effects of PM with aerodynamic diameter </= 2.5 microm, ozone, and nitrogen dioxide, and stronger associations among patients with type 2 diabetes. They conclude that findings support existing evidence of adverse effects of ambient air pollution and traffic exposure on HRV, and underscore the need to consider susceptible populations when setting air quality standards.",6.3.2.2,Heart Rate/Heart Rate Variability,0,0

Determinants of exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) need to be understood better to maximize the value of FeNO measurement in clinical practice and research. Our aim was to identify significant predictors of FeNO in an initial cross-sectional survey of southern California schoolchildren, part of a larger longitudinal study of asthma incidence.
Methods
During one school year, we measured FeNO at 100 ml/sec flow, using a validated offline technique, in 2568 children of age 7?10 yr. We estimated online (50 ml/sec flow) FeNO using a prediction equation from a separate smaller study with adjustment for offline measurement artifacts, and analyzed its relationship to clinical and demographic characteristics.
Results
FeNO was lognormally distributed with geometric means ranging from 11 ppb in children without atopy or asthma to 16 ppb in children with allergic asthma. Although effects of atopy and asthma were highly significant, ranges of FeNO for children with and without those conditions overlapped substantially. FeNO was significantly higher in subjects aged > 9, compared to younger subjects. Asian-American boys showed significantly higher FeNO than children of all other sex/ethnic groups; Hispanics and African-Americans of both sexes averaged slightly higher than non-Hispanic whites. Increasing height-for-age had no significant effect, but increasing weight-for-height was associated with decreasing FeNO.
Conclusion
FeNO measured offline is a useful biomarker for airway inflammation in large population-based studies. Further investigation of age, ethnicity, body-size, and genetic influences is needed, since they may contribute to substantial variation in FeNO.",7.2.4,"Pulmonary Inflammation, Injury, and Oxidative Stress",0,0

METHODS: We compared estimated exposure to ambient air pollutants during early pregnancy among mothers of children with oral cleft defects (cases) to that among mothers of controls, adjusting for available risk factors from birth certificates. We obtained ambient air pollutant data from air monitoring sites in New Jersey for carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), ozone (O3), sulfur dioxide (SO(2)), particulate matter <10 mum in aerodynamic diameter (PM10) and particulate matter <2.5 mum in aerodynamic diameter (PM2.5). We used values from the nearest monitor (within 40 km of the residence at birth) for controls, cleft lip with or without cleft palate (CLP) and cleft palate only (CPO). RESULTS: Based on logistic regression analyses for each contaminant and all contaminants together, there were no consistent elevated associations between selected air pollutants and cleft malformations. Quartile of CO concentration showed a consistent protective association with CPO (p < 0.01). For other contaminants, confidence intervals (95%) of the odds ratios for some quartiles excluded one. CLP showed limited evidence of an association with increasing SO(2) exposure while CPO showed weak associations with increasing O3 exposure. CONCLUSION: There was little consistent evidence associating cleft malformations with maternal exposure to ambient air pollutants. Evaluating particular pollutants or disease subgroups would require more detailed measurement of exposure and classification of cleft defects. Birth Defects Research (Part A), 2010.

We hypothesized that declining air quality during in vitro fertilization (IVF) would adversely affect live birth rates. 

METHODS: Data from US Environmental Protection Agency air quality monitors and an established national-scale, log-normal kriging method were used to spatially estimate daily mean concentrations of criteria pollutants at addresses of 7403 females undergoing their first IVF cycle and at the their IVF labs from 2000 to 2007 in the Northeastern USA. These data were related to pregnancy outcomes. 

RESULTS: Increases in nitrogen dioxide (NO2) concentration both at the patient's address and at the IVF lab were significantly associated with a lower chance of pregnancy and live birth during all phases of an IVF cycle from medication start to pregnancy test [most significantly after embryo transfer, odds ratio (OR) 0.76, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.66?0.86, per 0.01 ppm increase]. Increasing ozone (O3) concentration at the patient's address was significantly associated with an increased chance of live birth during ovulation induction (OR 1.26, 95% CI 1.10?1.44, per 0.02 ppm increase), but with decreased odds of live birth when exposed from embryo transfer to live birth (OR 0.62, 95% CI 0.48?0.81, per 0.02 ppm increase). After modeling for interactions of NO2 and O3 at the IVF lab, NO2 remained negatively and significantly associated with live birth (OR 0.86, 95% CI 0.78?0.96), whereas O3 was non-significant. Fine particulate matter (PM2.5) at the IVF lab during embryo culture was associated with decreased conception rates (OR 0.90, 95% CI 0.82?0.99, per 8 ?g/m3 increase), but not with live birth rates. No associations were noted with sulfur dioxide or larger particulate matter (PM10). 

CONCLUSIONS: The effects of declining air quality on reproductive outcomes after IVF are variable, cycle-dependent and complex, though increased NO2 is consistently associated with lower live birth rates.

Nipponbare) seedlings exposed to 0.2 ppm O-3 for a period of 24 h. On the basis of the morphological alteration of O-3-exposed rice leaves, transcript profiling of rice genes was performed in leaves exposed for 1, 12, and 24 h using rice DNA microarray chip. A total of 1535 nonredundant genes showed altered expression of more than 5-fold over the control, representing 8 main functional categories. Genes involved in information storage and processing (10%) and cellular processing and signaling categories (24%) were highly represented within 1 h of O-3 treatment; transcriptional factor and signal transduction, respectively, were the main subcategories. Genes categorized into information storage and processing (17, 23%), cellular processing and signaling (20,16%) and metabolism (18, 19%) were mainly regulated at 12 and 24 h; their main subcategories were ribosomal protein, post-translational modification, and signal transduction and secondary metabolites biosynthesis, respectively. Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis-based proteomics analyses in combination with tandem mass spectrometer identified 23 differentially expressed protein spots (21 nonredundant proteins) in leaves exposed to O-3 for 24 h compared to respective control. Identified proteins were found to be involved in cellular processing and signaling (32%), photosynthesis (19%), and defense (14%). Capillary electrophoresis-mass spectrometry-based metabolomic profiling revealed accumulation of amino acids, gamma-aminobutyric acid, and glutathione in O-3 exposed leaves until 24 h over control.

Populus trichocarpa), previously classified as ozone tolerant and ozone sensitive, had differing physiological and biochemical responses when fumigated with 120 nL L<sup>??E?a??1</sup> ozone for 6 h per day for eight consecutive days. Isoprene emission rate, ozone uptake and a number of physiological and biochemical parameters were investigated before, during and after fumigation with ozone. Previous studies have shown that isoprene protects plants against oxidative stress. Therefore, it was hypothesized that these two genotypes would differ in either their basal isoprene emission rates or in the response of isoprene to fumigation by ozone. Our results showed that the basal emission rates of isoprene, physiological responses and ozone uptake rates were all similar. However, significant differences were found in visible damage, carotenoids, hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), thiobarbituric acid reactions (TBARS) and post-fumigation isoprene emission rates. It is shown that, although the classification of ozone tolerance or sensitivity had been previously clearly and carefully defined using one particular set of parameters, assessment of other key variables does not necessarily lead to the same conclusions. Thus, it may be necessary to reconsider the way in which plants are classified as ozone tolerant or sensitive.

Many models exhibited thresholds (25-45 mu m g/m(3) for PM10, and 10-45 ppb for O-3). Our preliminary exploratory analyses suggest that the use of a linear, no threshold, model for pollution studies is not consistent with the observed data.

However, few existing dynamical models are well enough understood and documented to detect or quantify the cumulative effects and to answer pertinent questions posed by the World Health Organization (WHO): 'Is there a threshold below which no effects of the pollutants on health are expected to occur in all people?' and 'What averaging period (time pattern) is the most relevant from the point of view of health?'. Using a new semi-parametric time series modelling approach, which incorporates non-linearity and latent cumulative variables, we show that the cumulative effects on health due to continual exposure to environmental pollutants can be very serious even at levels below the national ambient air quality standards of America (NAAQS). The situation is especially worrying for chronic sufferers. Our study suggests that different pollutants may require different cumulative periods (on average) to impact on health but they share a similar functional form in respect of their impact.

To advance understanding of these relationships, further characterization of the dose-response and pollutant lag effects are needed, as are investigations of pollutant species beyond the commonly measured criteria pollutants. Objectives: Investigate short-term associations between ambient air pollutant concentrations and emergency department visits for pediatric asthma. Methods: Daily counts of emergency department visits for asthma or wheeze among children age 5 to 17 were collected from 41 Metropolitan Atlanta hospitals during 1993-2004 (n = 91,386 visits). Ambient concentrations of gaseous pollutants and speciated particulate matter were available from stationary monitors during this time period. Rate ratios for the warm season (May-October) and cold season (November-April) were estimated using Poisson generalized linear models in the framework of a case-crossover analysis. Measurements and Main Results: Both ozone and primary pollutants from traffic sources were associated with emergency department visits for asthma or wheeze; evidence for independent effects of ozone and primary pollutants from traffic sources were observed in multipollutant models. These associations tended to be of the highest magnitude for concentrations on the day of the emergency department visit and were present at relatively low ambient concentrations. Conclusions: Even at relatively low ambient concentrations, ozone and primary pollutants from traffic sources independently contributed to the burden of emergency department visits for pediatric asthma.",6.2.7.1,Summary of Findings from 26 O3 AQCD,3.1.1.2,The Role of Season and Temperature on Ozone Associations with Respiratory Health Effects

Here we show that a novel dual BLT1 and BLT2 receptor antagonist, RO5101576, potently inhibited LTB4-evoked calcium mobilization in HL-60 cells and chemotaxis of human neutrophils. RO5101576 significantly attenuated LTB4-evoked pulmonary eosinophilia in guinea pigs.

We measured hourly outdoor home pollutant gases, particle number, PM2.5, organic carbon, and black carbon. Data were analyzed with mixed models controlling for temperature, posture, actigraph activity, hour, community, and season.

Results: We found positive associations of systolic and diastolic BP with air pollutants. The strongest associations were with organic carbon (especially its estimated fossil-fuel- combustion fraction), multiday average exposures, and time periods when subjects were at home. An interquartile increase in 5-day average organic carbon (5.2 ?g/m3) was associated with 8.2 mm Hg higher mean systolic BP (95% confidence interval = 3.0?13.4) and 5.8 mm Hg higher mean diastolic BP (3.0?8.6). Associations of BP with 1?8 hour average air pollution were stronger with reports of moderate to strenuous physical exertion but not with higher actigraph motion. Associations were also stronger among 12 obese subjects.

Conclusions: Exposure to primary organic components of fossil fuel combustion near the home were strongly associated with increased ambulatory BP in a population at potential risk of heart attack. Low fitness or obesity may increase the effects of pollutants.",6.3.2.6,Blood Pressure,0,0

Method: We explored associations between dates of activation of defibrillators and daily concentrations of various metrics of particulate matter and of pollutant gases at lags from 0 to 5 days, using a fixed-stratum case-crossover analysis controlling for confounding factors.

Results: Over an average of 1200 days of observation, 705 patients experienced 5462 activation days. Of 11 pollutants considered, we found positive associations with particle sulfate, particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter less than 10 ?m and less than 2.5 ?m, ozone, and sulfur dioxide. Only the association for particle sulfate was not easily explainable by chance (for 1 ?g/m3, lag 0?1 day, odds ratio = 1.025 [95% confidence interval = 1.003 to 1.047]). There was little or no evidence of associations with markers of primary vehicle emissions (particle number concentration, black smoke, nitrogen oxides, and carbon monoxide). There was little evidence of interactions with clinical factors such as ischemic heart disease, frequency of activation, or cardiac drugs.

Conclusion: Overall there was little evidence of an association between air pollution and activation of implantable cardioverter defibrillators.

However, only a few studies have focused on subgroups of the population especially vulnerable to these effects. OBJECTIVES: To estimate the association between exposure to ozone and cause-specific mortality, and to evaluate whether individual socio-demographic characteristics as well as chronic conditions confer greater susceptibility to the adverse effects of ozone. METHODS: A case-crossover analysis was conducted in 10 Italian cities. Data on mortality were collected for the period 2001-2005 (April to September), for 127,860 deceased subjects. Information was retrieved on cause of death, socio-demographic characteristics, chronic conditions from previous hospital admissions, and location of death. Daily ozone concentrations were collected from background fixed monitors. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: We estimated a 1.5% (95% confidence interval, 0.9-2.1) increase in total mortality for a 10 mug/m(3) increase in ozone (8-hour, lag 0-5). The effect lasted several days for total, cardiac and respiratory mortality (lag 0-5) and it was delayed for cerebrovascular deaths (lag 3-5). In the subgroup analysis, the effect was more pronounced in elderly people over 85 years of age (3.5%, 95% confidence interval 2.4-4.6) than in 35-64 year-old subjects (0.8%, 95% confidence interval -0.8-2.5), in women (2.2%, 95% confidence interval 1.4-3.1) than in men (0.8%, 95% confidence interval -0.1-1.8), and for out-of-hospital deaths (2.1%, 95% confidence interval 1.0-3.2), especially among diabetics (5.5%, 95% confidence interval 1.4-9.8).

Methods: We started to collect information about our own patient''s smoking habits in January 1996 to evaluate prospectively the influence on IVF success. Information regarding 799 patients (607 nonsmokers and 192 smokers) was obtained. Additionally we retrieved seven relevant publications from the unabridged MEDLINE1982?1996. They were recalculated to first cycles, because from a biometrical point of view, only the results of the first IVF cycle are really well comparable, as the number of necessary IVF cycles always correlates with the number of pregnancies. These data were compared in the nonparametric sign test according to Dixon?Mood and calculated as relative success ratios, defined as the quotient of the probability of IVF-ET success of nonsmokers divided by that of smokers for each publication.
Results: This meta-analysis, based on a total of 2314 first IVF-ET treatments, showed that almost twice as many IVF-ET cycles were needed for smokers as for nonsmokers to become pregnant. For the success quotient, we obtained a ratio of 1.79, with an associated 95% confidence interval of from 1.24 to 2.59.

To our knowledge, this proposition has never been tested with high-frequency longitudinal ultrasound data from normally growing human fetuses. The present study examined whether fetal growth in leg length had its peak velocity at or about 20-26 gestational weeks and declined subsequently and whether estimated fetal weight velocity was maximal at or about 33 weeks and declined subsequently; if the greatest acquisition of leg length occurred in the second trimester and weight in the third trimester; and if birth outcomes reflected these relationships. The data in this study included approximately weekly longitudinal ultrasound data collected from 44 maternal/fetal pairs in Brussels, Belgium. Diaphyseal lengths of the femur and tibia provided information on leg growth and estimated fetal weight was assessed from the biparietal and occipital-frontal head diameters and transverse and anterior-posterior diameters of the abdomen. Growth patterns were investigated from individual growth curves derived from daily growth velocity z-scores. Paired t-tests compared individuals' trimestral increments in leg length and fetal weight. Least-squares regression models employing the robust procedure for repeated measurements were used to test for relationships between trimester, size, growth rates, and birth outcome, controlling for day of measurement, sex, maternal smoking, and gestational age at birth. The normal fetuses in this study grew by pulsatile patterns of leg and estimated weight acquisition, not a single peak and decline process. Greater incremental growth in estimated fetal weight occurred during the second trimester and leg length in the third trimester. Individual and sex effects were significant in growth velocity patterns. Girls grew with greater synchrony between leg and weight growth and were accelerated by comparison with boys, with faster leg growth predicting lower ponderal index by the second trimester. Birth outcomes were sex-specific in timing effects and predictive variables. These results support the importance of sex-specific analyses, reemphasize the common notion that girls grow faster than boys, and direct attention to cross-talk between energy resources and growth.

Indeed, both share a common pathway composed of uterine contractility, cervical dilatation and activation of the membranes/decidua. This review explores the concept that while term labour results from physiological activation of the components of the common pathway, preterm labour arises from pathological signalling and activation of one or more components of the common pathway of parturition. The term 'great obstetrical syndromes' has been coined to reframe the concept of obstetrical disease. Such syndromes are characterised by: (1) multiple aetiology; (2) long preclinical stage; (3) frequent fetal involvement; (4) clinical manifestations that are often adaptive in nature; and (5) gene?environment interactions that may predispose to the syndromes.

We use chronic daily exposure of up to 163 ppb O3, and twice weekly application of up to 320 ?g plant?1  methyl jasmonate (MeJA) to test two hypothesizes: 1) a low rate of MeJA does not affect growth but increases O3 sensitivity; 2) a high rate inhibits growth but reduces O3  sensitivity. Both hypotheses were rejected. Growth declined with increases in both MeJA and O3. MeJA at 40 ?g plant?1 caused no direct effect, and at 160 ?g plant?1  reduced growth similarly at all O3. Neither rate altered O3 sensitivity. These additive responses are not consistent with protection by MeJA in this system. They may reflect inter-specific differences in signalling, since O3  concentrations used here exceeded some reported acute exposures. Alternatively, parallel responses to O3 and MeJA may suggest that O3-induced jasmonates play a developmental role in chronic response but no protective role in the absence of lesions characteristic of acute exposure.

To investigate the transcriptional responsiveness of adult trees to ozone, fully-expanded sun and shade leaves of mature beech trees were harvested at four time points over the entire vegetation period in 2005 and 2006. Microarray analyses were conducted on leaves from trees grown in the field under ambient and twice-ambient ozone concentrations at Kranzberger Forst (Bavaria). Beech trees changed their transcript levels in response to ozone. In the years 2005 and 2006 different transcription patterns were observed; this may have been a result of different weather conditions and ozone uptake. Furthermore, we obtained differences in mRNA expression patterns between shade and sun leaves. In the ozone-treated sun leaves of 2005, slightly up- and down-regulated transcript levels were detected, particularly in the spring and autumn, whereas shade leaves clearly exhibited reduced mRNA levels, particularly at the end of the vegetation period. In 2006, this pattern could not be confirmed, and in the autumn, four other transcripts were slightly up-regulated in ozone-treated shade leaves. In addition, two other transcripts were found to be influenced in sun leaves in the spring/summer. While we detected changes in the levels of only a few transcripts, the observed effects were not identical in both years. In conclusion, elevated ozone exhibited very small influence on the transcription levels of genes of mature beech trees.

Objectives: To evaluate the relationship of new onset asthma with traffic-related pollution near homes and schools.

Methods: Parent-reported physician diagnosis of new onset asthma (N=120) was identified during three years of follow-up of a cohort of 2497 kindergarten and first grade children who were asthma- and wheezing-free at study entry into the southern California Children?s Health Study. Traffic-related pollution exposure was assessed based on a line source dispersion model of traffic volume, distance from home and school, and local meteorology. Regional ambient ozone, nitrogen dioxide (NO2), and particulate matter were measured continuously at one central site monitor in each of 13 study communities. Hazard ratios (HRs) for new onset asthma were scaled to the range of ambient central site pollutants and to the residential inter-quartile range for each traffic exposure metric.

Results: Asthma risk increased with modeled traffic-related pollution exposure from roadways near homes (HR 1.51; 95% confidence interval 1.25-1.82) and near schools (HR 1.45;1.06-1.98). Ambient NO2 measured at a central site in each community was also associated with increased risk (HR 2.18;1.18-4.01). In models with both NO2 and modeled traffic exposures, there were independent associations of asthma with traffic-related pollution at school and home, while the estimate for NO2 was attenuated (HR 1.37;0.69,2.71).

In this study, the in vivo root development before, during and after short-term ozone exposure of individual subterranean clover seedling shoots (Trifolium subterraneum L.) was studied non-destructively using a new experimental growth and exposure system. Plants were grown individually in thin root growth chambers, where the entire root system could be observed non-invasively for weeks.

Altered root growth occurred within the first week after exposure and persisted for three weeks. Root tip formation and elongation rates were reduced by 35?40%. Doubling of the number of root tips was delayed by one week. Roots of exposed plants were therefore shorter and less branched. Above-ground changes were apparent about one week after below-ground changes. The leaf development rate was reduced by about 25%, but the number of flower stems at harvest was unaffected. Ratios between below and above-ground growth were significantly reduced by not, vert, similar60% the first week after exposure and remained lower for up to three weeks suggesting reduced carbon allocation to root growth. Nevertheless, biomass and biomass ratios at harvest five weeks after exposure were not significantly altered, indicating that traditional destructive sampling once, at harvest, would not have revealed any of the early below-ground changes observed in this study.

In tobacco, the major ROS-induced MAPK is salicylate-induced protein kinase (SIPK). We found through gain-of-function and loss-of-function approaches that both overexpression and RNA interference-based suppression of SIPK render the plant sensitive to ROS stress. Transgenic lines overexpressing a nonphosphorylatable version of SIPK were not ROS sensitive. Analysis of the MAPK activation profiles in ROS-stressed transgenic and wild-type plants revealed a striking interplay between SIPK and another MAPK (wound-induced protein kinase [WIPK]) in the different kinotypes. During continuous ozone exposure, abnormally prolonged activation of SIPK was seen in the SIPK-overexpression genotype, without WIPK activation, whereas strong and stable activation of WIPK was observed in the SIPK-suppressed lines.

Hydrogen peroxide and superoxide anion radicals can substitute for ozone as the activation stimulus, which does not appear to require salicylate as an intermediary. The properties of the ozone-induced MAPK suggest that it may be SIPK (salicylate-induced protein kinase), a tobacco MAPK that is activated by a variety of stress treatments.

Methods: Daily levels of O3 were measured at a background measurement station in 1998-2004 in Helsinki, Finland. All analyses were a priori restricted to the warm season.

Twelve subjects with asthma were evaluated at exacerbation and after 5 days of therapy with prednisone. At exacerbation, malondialdehyde levels were higher in patients with asthma (30.2 +/- 2.4 nM) than in control subjects (19.4 +/- 1.9 nM, p = 0.002) and were reduced after steroid therapy (18.5 +/- 1.6 nM, p = 0.001). At exacerbation, glutathione levels were lower in subjects with asthma (5.96 +/- 0.6 nM) than in control subjects (14.1 +/- 0.8 nM, p < 0.0001) and were increased after the therapy (8.44 +/- 1.2 nM, p = 0.04). Malondialdehyde and glutathione both in subjects with asthma and control subjects were negatively correlated (r = -0.5, p = 0.001).

Because the immune response plays a critical role in each of these diseases, it is important to study the effects of toxicants on the developing immune system. Children's unique susceptibility to environmental toxicants has become an important focus of the field of immunotoxicology and the use of immune biomarkers in molecular epidemiology of children's environmental health is a rapidly expanding field of research. In this review, we discuss how markers of immune status and immunotoxicity are being applied to pediatric studies, with a specific focus on the various methods used to analyze T-helper-1/2 (Th1/Th2) cytokine profiles. Furthermore, we review recent data on the effects of children's environmental exposures to volatile organic compounds, metals, and pesticides on Th1/Th2 cytokine profiles and the associations of Th1/Th2 profiles with adverse health outcomes such as pediatric respiratory diseases, allergies, cancer and diabetes. Although cytokine profiles are increasingly used in children's studies, there is still a need to acquire distribution data for different ages and ethnic groups of healthy children. These data will contribute to the validation and standardization of cytokine biomarkers for future studies. Application of immunological markers in epidemiological studies will improve the understanding of mechanisms that underlie associations between environmental exposures and immune-mediated disorders.",6.2.3.2,Epidemiology,0,0

A variety of approaches has been used to monitor nasal inflammation objectively to investigate disease processes and to evaluate the effect of therapeutic intervention. These approaches include nasal lavage, nasal cytology, and nasal biopsy, together with the more recently established measurement of nasal nitric oxide (NO) concentration. Although all provide information about nasal mucosal inflammation, the extent of information that can be obtained by each approach, the ease of sampling, and the complexity of sample handling differ. Such considerations influence the choice of approach when measurement of nasal inflammation is to be an objective outcome parameter in a clinical trial. In addition, the choice of approach is also determined by the questions or hypotheses that are to be addressed. Nasal lavage is simple and rapid to perform, is well tolerated, and provides a sample that can provide information about luminal cell recruitment, cell activation, and plasma protein extravasation. Nasal cytology involves sampling and recovering mucosal surface cells. It is also easy to perform and is well tolerated in general, although some find that the procedure causes a transient unpleasant sensation. A differential cell count from the sample provides information about relative cell populations. Both nasal lavage and nasal cytology are readily applicable to clinical trials. Nasal cytology sample handling is easier, but nasal lavage offers the advantage of providing considerably greater information from the sample. Nasal biopsy is a considerably more invasive procedure and requires expertise not only in tissue sampling but also in biopsy processing. Therefore, it is applicable only in specialist centers. However, nasal biopsy is the only sampling technique that directly informs about tissue cellular events, although these may be implied, in part from the other sampling approaches. Tissue specimens can be used to evaluate both protein and gene expression. Measurement of nasal NO involves expensive equipment but provides an instantaneous result, unlike the other approaches, all of which require sample processing and analysis. Recommendations for standardization of measurement have been made, and measures are considered in part to reflect allergic inflammation within the nasal mucosa. The limitations of nasal NO are that it reflects only a certain aspect of allergic mucosal inflammation, and that because a proportion of nasally measured NO is derived from the sinuses under normal circumstances, nasal NO is not specific for nasal disease. The high contribution from the sinus mucosa limits the discriminatory ability of nasal NO to reflect nasal tissue-specific alterations. The incorporation of measures of nasal inflammation in clinical trials has distinguished anti-inflammatory therapy from symptomatic therapy and has the potential to provide information about the efficacy of novel therapies for allergic rhinitis.",6.2.3.2,Epidemiology,0,0

Rapid increase in interest in EBC has resulted from the recognition that in lung disease this easily sampled fluid has measurable characteristics that differ prominently from health. These assays have provided evidence of airway and lung redox deviation, acid-base status, and degree and type of inflammation in acute and chronic asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, adult respiratory distress syndrome, occupational diseases, and cystic fibrosis. Characterized by uncertain and variable degrees of dilution, EBC does not provide precise assessment of individual solute concentrations within native airway lining fluid. However, it can provide useful information when concentrations differ substantially between health and disease or are based on ratios of solutes found in the sample.

Malondialdehyde (MDA) is one of several low-molecular-weight end products formed via the decomposition of certain primary and secondary lipid peroxidation products. At low pH and elavated temperature, MDA readily participates in nucleophilic addition reaction with 2-thiobarbituric acid (TBA), generating a red, fluorescent 1:2 MDA:TBA adduct. These facts, along with the availability of facile and sensitive methods to quantify MDA (as the free aldehyde or its TBA derivative), have led to the routine use of MDA determination and, particularly, the ?TBA test? to detect and quantify lipid peroxidation in a wide array of sample types. However, MDA itself participates in reactions with molecules other than TBA and is a catabolic substrate. Only certain lipid peroxidation products generate MDA (invariably with low yields), and MDA is neither the sole end product of fatty peroxide formation and decomposition nor a substance generated exclusively through lipid peroxidation. Many factors (e.g., stimulus for and conditions of peroxidation) modulate MDA formation from lipid. Additional factors (e.g., TBA-test reagents and constituents) have profound effects on test response to fatty peroxide-derived MDA. The TBA test is intrinsically nonspecific for MDA: nonlipid-related materials as well as fatty peroxide-derived decomposition products other than MDA are TBA positive. These and other considerations from the extensive literature on MDA, TBA reactivity, and oxidative lipid degradation support the conclusion that MDA determination and the TBA test can offer, at best, a narrow and somewhat empirical window on the complex process of lipid peroxidation. The MDA content and/or TBA reactivity of a system provides no information on the precise structures of the ?MDA precursor(s),? their molecular origins, or the amount of each formed. Consequently, neither MDA determination nor TBA-test response can generally be regarded as a diagnostic index of the occurrence/extent of lipid peroxidation, fatty hydroperoxide formation, or oxidative injury to tissue lipid without independent chemical evidence of the analyte being measured and its source. In some cases, MDA/TBA reactivity is an indicator of lipid peroxidation; in other situations, no qualitative or quantitative relationship exists among sample MDA content, TBA reactivity, and fatty peroxide tone. Utilization of MDA analysis and/or the TBA test and interpretation of sample MDA content and TBA test response in studies of lipid peroxidation require caution, discretion, and (especially in biological systems) correlative data from other indices of fatty peroxide formation and decomposition.",6.2.3.2,Epidemiology,0,0

Our aim was to assess the usefulness of eNO for diagnosing and predicting loss of control (LOC) in asthma following steroid withdrawal. Comparisons were made against sputum eosinophils and airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR) to hypertonic saline (4.5%). Seventy-eight patients with mild/moderate asthma had their inhaled steroid therapy withdrawn until LOC occurred or for a maximum of 6 wk. Sixty (77.9%) developed LOC. There were highly significant correlations between the changes in eNO and symptoms (p < 0.0001), FEV(1) (p < 0.002), sputum eosinophils (p < 0.0002), and saline PD(15) (p < 0.0002), and there were significant differences between LOC and no LOC groups. Both single measurements and changes of eNO (10 ppb, 15 ppb, or an increase of > 60% over baseline) had positive predictive values that ranged from 80 to 90% for predicting and diagnosing LOC.

Elevated levels of exhaled levels of exhaled NO in asthma and other inflammatory lung diseases lead to many studies examining NO as potential markers of airway inflammation, enabling repeated noninvasive and standardized monitoring of airway inflammation. In airway inflammation, NO is not merely a marker but may have anti-inflammatory and pro-inflammatory effects. Significant correlation has been found between exhaled NO and skin test scores in steroid naive asthmatic patients, allowing to discriminate patients with and without airway responsiveness. Exhaled NO is significantly elevated in acute asthma, or steroid-resistant severe asthma, or when the maintenance dose of inhaled steroids is reduced, and quickly reduced down to the levels in patients with stable asthma after steroid treatment. Exhaled NO has been successfully used to monitor anti-inflammatory treatment with inhaled corticosteroids in asthma. Exhaled NO is extremely sensitive and rapid marker of the dose-dependent effect of steroid treatment, or asthma deterioration, which is increased to any changes in lung function, provocative concentration causing a 20% fall in forced expiratory volume, sputum eosinophilia or asthma symptoms. Exhaled NO is not increased in stable chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), but patients with unstable COPD, or bronchiectasis have high NO levels. Exhaled and nasal NO are diagnostically low in cystic fibrosis and primary pulmonary dyskinesia.

One of the well-recognized targets of free radical-induced injury is peroxidation of lipids. Using a variety of approaches, we have found that a series of prostaglandin F2-like compounds are produced in vivo in humans by a non-cyclooxygenase mechanism involving free radical-catalyzed peroxidation of arachidonic acid. Levels of these compounds in normal human plasma and urine range from 5 to 40 pg/ml and 500 to 4000 pg/mg of creatinine, respectively. In rats, their formation was found to increase as much as 200-fold in association with marked free radical-catalyzed lipid peroxidation induced by administration of CCl4 and diquat. To explore whether these prostanoids can exert biological activity, the effects of one of the compounds formed by this mechanism, 8-epi-prostaglandin F2 alpha, was examined in the kidney in the rat. Infusion of 8-epi-prostaglandin F2 alpha into a peripheral vein (5 micrograms/kg per min) or intrarenally (0.5-2.0 micrograms/kg per min) resulted in marked parallel reductions in renal blood flow and glomerular filtration rate. That the formation of these prostanoids is catalyzed by free radicals and that they can exert potent biological activity suggest that these prostanoids may participate as pathophysiological mediators in oxidant injury. Quantification of these compounds may also provide a noninvasive approach to assess oxidant status in humans. That the formation of these prostanoids occurs independent of the catalytic activity of the cyclooxygenase enzyme suggests that there may be limitations at times regarding the reliability of the use of cyclooxygenase inhibitors to assess the role of prostaglandins in certain pathophysiological processes.",6.2.3.2,Epidemiology,0,0

Biomarkers derive from a variety of sources [bronchiolar lavage (BAL), sputum, exhaled breath, and blood], and have widely variant performance characteristics, and applicability.

Recent findings: Increasing attention is given to biomarkers in exhaled breath, both gaseous (exhaled nitric oxide) and higher molecular weight moieties [in exhaled breath condensate (EBC)]. Current research in EBC analysis has focused on validation, standardization, and technical considerations, whereas research on exhaled nitric oxide (ENO) has moved to testing its predictive value in clinical situations. The use of advanced biostatistical techniques, and combinatorial analyses has led to additional advances in the utility of biomarkers.

Summary: To date, the best validated, and best performing biomarkers for clinical asthma appear to be measures of inflammation in induced sputum, and measures of ENO. Some trials using ENO appear particularly promising for early clinical use. EBC metrics are at present too inchoate for clinical purposes. However, not all important clinical and research questions can be addressed with sputum, EBC, or ENO metrics, leaving an important place for BAL, bronchial biopsy, and perhaps EBC measurements in the research arena.

At 24 weeks gestation the range is 17% to 58%, and at 25 weeks gestation 35% to 85%.

Objectives: We examined the effects of air pollutants on heart-rate?corrected QT interval (QTc), an electrocardiographic marker of ventricular repolarization, and whether these associations were modified by participant characteristics and genetic polymorphisms related to oxidative stress.

Methods: We studied repeated measurements of QTc on 580 men from the Veterans Affairs Normative Aging Study (NAS) using mixed-effects models with random intercepts. We fitted a quadratic constrained distributed lag model to estimate the cumulative effect on QTc of ambient air pollutants including fine particulate matter ? 2.5 ?m in aerodynamic diameter (PM2.5), ozone (O3), black carbon (BC), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), carbon monoxide (CO), and sulfur dioxide (SO2) concentrations during the 10 hr before the visit. We genotyped polymorphisms related to oxidative stress and analyzed pollution?susceptibility score interactions using the genetic susceptibility score (GSS) method.

Results: Ambient traffic pollutant concentrations were related to longer QTc. An interquartile range (IQR) change in BC cumulative during the 10 hr before the visit was associated with increased QTc [1.89 msec change; 95% confidence interval (CI), ?0.16 to 3.93]. We found a similar association with QTc for an IQR change in 1-hr BC that occurred 4 hr before the visit (2.54 msec change; 95% CI, 0.28?4.80). We found increased QTc for IQR changes in NO2 and CO, but the change was statistically insignificant. In contrast, we found no association between QTc and PM2.5, SO2, and O3. The association between QTc and BC was stronger among participants who were obese, who had diabetes, who were nonsmokers, or who had higher GSSs.

Conclusions: Traffic-related pollutants may increase QTc among persons with diabetes, persons who are obese, and nonsmoking elderly individuals; the number of genetic variants related to oxidative stress increases this effect.",6.3.2.2,Heart Rate/Heart Rate Variability,0,0

However the evidence regarding the association between air pollution and acute cardiac events, such as out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, is inconsistent.

Methods: We investigated the association between particulate matter (PM) air pollution and out-of-hospital cardiac arrest using a case-crossover study of adults (age, 35+ years) in Melbourne, Australia. We included 8434 cases identified through the Victorian Cardiac Arrest Registry from 2003 through 2006. We excluded arrests with an obvious preceding noncardiac event such as trauma, poisoning, or drowning, leaving only those events that were presumed to have cardiac etiology. Air pollution concentrations obtained from a central monitoring site were used for day of the arrest and for lag 1, lag 2, and lag 3, including the average lag 0-1. 

Results: An interquartile range increase of 4.26 mu g/m(3) in PM(2.5) over 2 days (lag 0-1) was associated with an increase in risk for an out-of-hospital cardiac arrest of 3.6% (95% confidence interval = 1.3% to 6.0%). PM 10 and carbon monoxide also showed associations, but not as strong as for PM(2.5). Longer lag periods did not show such strong relationships. There was no association of these cardiac events with ozone, sulfur dioxide, or nitrogen dioxide in any lag period. Individuals age 65-74 years old were most susceptible to PM(2.5) exposure, while those 75 years and older had the lowest risk. 

Conclusion: These findings support an association between daily average PM(2.5) concentrations and an increased risk of out-of-hospital cardiac arrests.",6.3.2.7,Hospital Admissions and Emergency Department Visits,4.1.7.1,Epidemiologic Studies of Emergency Department Visits and Hospital Admissions

During dry 2003, the stimulating effect of O(3) on soil respiration rate vanished under spruce, which was correlated with decreased fine-root production in spruce under drought, irrespective of the O(3) regime. delta(13)C signature of newly formed fine-roots was consistent with the differing g(s) of beech and spruce, and indicated stomatal limitation by O(3) in beech and by drought in spruce.

Furthermore, intestine and lung epithelium synthesize FBG after exposure to inflammatory mediators, and both plasma and lung cell-derived FBG, along with fibronectin, assemble in detergent-insoluble extracellular matrices (ECM) of pneumocytes and fibroblasts independent of thrombin or plasmin cleavage. An epitope cryptic in soluble FBG (beta(15-21)) but exposed in matrix-FBG and fibrin induces cell proliferation and actin cytoskeleton reorganization during wound repair and angiogenesis. Although fibrin(ogen) is involved in hemostasis and homeostasis, mechanisms regulating extrahepatic FBG expression remain unexplored. Herein we examined FBG production by lung compared to liver epithelial cell lines in response to dexamethasone (DEX)+IL-6. Regulated synthesis of HepG2-FBG follows the pathway shown for constitutive synthesis by liver epithelium. Constitutive A549-FBG expression was not detectable, however, intracellular FBG precursors in DEX+IL-6-treated A549 lung cells were similar to HepG2 cells with two notable exceptions. The relative rate of chain synthesis in HepG2 cells was unequal, whereas nascent synthesis of all three chains occurred at equivalent rates in stimulated A549 cells. Unlike HepG2 cells, which rapidly secreted intact FBG, nascent dimeric FBG accumulated in the A549 cell-associated fraction prior to release into medium. Furthermore, soluble A549-FBG was susceptible to thrombin and plasmin cleavage. Interestingly, many functionally diverse proteins possess FBG-related domains that direct cell-fate determination during development or wound repair, suggesting that extrahepatic FBG biosynthesis evoked only during inflammation plays such a role during localized injury and repair to restore tissue homeostasis.",6.3.3,Toxicology,0,0

The role of particulate matter (PM) and ozone (O3) as co-pollutants in this association is unclear. We hypothesize that cardiac function following PM and O3 exposure is variably affected by genetic determinants (Nppa and Npr1 genes) and age. Heart function was measured before and after 2 days each of the following exposure sequence; (1) 2-h filtered air (FA) and 3-h carbon black (CB; 0.5 ?g/m3); (2) 2-h O3 (0.6ppm) and 3-h FA; (3) 5-h FA; and, (4) 2-h O3 and 3-h CB. Two age groups (5 and 18 months old (mo)) were tested in C57Bl/6J (B6) and 129S1/SvImJ (129) mice using echocardiographic (echo) and in vivo hemodynamic (IVH) measurements. With echo, posterior wall thickness was significantly (P<0.01) greater in 129 relative to B6 mice at baseline. With CB exposure, young B6 and older 129 mice show significant (P<0.01) reductions in fractional shortening (FS) compared to FA. With O3 exposure, FS was significantly (P<0.01) diminished in young 129, which was attributable to significant increases in end-systolic left ventricular diameter. With O3 and CB combined, notable (P<0.01) declines in heart rate and end-systolic posterior wall thickness occurred in young 129 mice. The IVH measurements showed striking (P<0.05) compromises in cardiac function after CB and O3 exposure; however, strain differences were undetectable. These results suggest that PM and O3 exposures, alone and combined, lead to different cardiac functional changes, and these unique changes are age-specific and dependent on Nppa and Npr1 genes.",6.3.3,Toxicology,4.1.4.3,Animal Toxicological Studies

Our study suggested that it was susceptible to elevated O3. Using open top chambers, changes in photosynthesis, lipid peroxidation and antioxidant system were studied in Q. mongolica leaves fumigated with elevated O3  (?80 nmol mol?1). During the O3 exposure, photosynthetic rate (Pn) and stomatal conductance decreased significantly, but the decrease in Pn hardly resulted from the stomatal limitation, as no decrease was observed in the intercellular CO2  concentration. In addition, significant decrease was noted in carboxylation efficiency, indicating that the CO2 fixation process was affected by O3, and it can be taken as the main factor leading to the decline of Pn, particularly in the initial 45 days of O3 fumigation. In the initial 45 days of O3 fumigation, ascorbate (Asc) content and activities of superoxide dismutase and ascorbate peroxidase were enhanced, but the enhanced antioxidant capability did not balance reactive oxygen species production, resulting in significant increase in malondialdehyde  content at day 45. In the following O3 fumigation period, significant decrease in activities of antioxidant enzymes and Asc content were recorded in the leaves. Along with the decline of antioxidant capability, chlorophyll loss, increase in electrolyte leakage and decrease in maximum photochemical efficiency of photosystem II were also noted.

This pollutant penetrates in leaves through stomata and quickly reacts inside leaves, thus making plants valuable ozone sinks, but at the same time triggers oxidation processes which lead to leaf injuries. To counteract these negative effects, plants produce an array of antioxidants which react with ozone and reactive molecules which ozone generates in the leaf tissues. In this study, we measured the effect of an ozone concentration which is likely to be attained in many areas of the world in the near future (80 ppb) on leaves of the vertical profile of the widespread agroforestry species Populus nigra. Changes in (1) physiological parameters (photosynthesis and stomatal conductance), (2) ozone uptake, (3) emission of volatile organic compounds (VOCs, i.e. isoprene, methanol and other oxygenated compounds), (4) concentration of antioxidant surface compounds, and (5) concentration of phenolic compounds were assessed. The aim was to assess whether the defensive pathways leading to isoprenoids and phenolics formation were induced when a moderate and chronic increment of ozone is not able to damage photosynthesis. No visual injuries and minor changes in physiology and ozone uptake were observed. The emission of isoprene and oxygenated six-carbon (C6) volatiles were inhibited by ozone, whereas methanol emission was increased, especially in developing leaves. We interpret these results as suggesting an ontogenetic shift in ozone-treated leaves, leading to a slower development and a faster senescence. Most surface and phenolic compounds showed a declining trend in concentration from the youngest to the fully expanded leaves. Ozone reduced the concentrations of chlorogenic acid derivatives at the leaf surface, whereas in total leaf extracts a metabolic shift towards few phenolics with higher antioxidant capacity was observed.",9.3.5.3,Secondary Metabolism,0,0

A novel canopy O3 exposure methodology was employed that allowed whole-tree assessment in situ  under twice-ambient O3 levels. Elevated O3 significantly weakened the C sink strength of the tree?soil system as evidenced by lowered photosynthesis and 44% reduction in whole-stem growth, but increased soil respiration. Associated effects in leaves and roots at the gene, cell and organ level varied from year to year, with drought being a crucial determinant of O3 responsiveness. Regarding adult individuals of a late-successional tree species, empirical proof is provided first time in relation to recent modelling predictions that enhanced ground-level O3 can substantially mitigate the C sequestration of forests in view of climate change.

Sluggishness increased the time to open (thus limiting CO2 uptake) and close stomata (thus increasing transpirational water loss) after abrupt changes in light level.

Free putrescine accumulated in undamaged tissue of both cultivars, whereas putrescine conjugated to soluble and cell-wall bound components accumulated predominantly in tissue undergoing cell death in Bel W3 plants. Accumulation was caused by a redirection of the conjugation pathway, as well as by a transient increase in arginine decarboxylase and ornithine decarboxylase specific activity. This increase seemed to be regulated at post-transcriptional level. Measurements of chlorophyll content and fluorescence showed that, in addition to visible necrotic lesions, Bel W3 plants suffered considerable photosynthetic damage in other parts of the leaf. Accumulation of conjugated putrescine is part of the ozone-induced programmed cell death response in Bel W3 plants. Ozone-induced synthesis of free putrescine is not correlated with ozone-resistance in Bel B plants, which are apparently impaired in signal transduction pathways that are necessary to control the cellular redox state.

We report the associations between daily maximum apparent temperature and daily deaths during the warm season in 15 European cities. METHODS: The city-specific analyses were based on generalized estimating equations and the city-specific results were combined in a Bayesian random effects meta-analysis. We specified distributed lag models in studying the delayed effect of exposure. Time-varying coefficient models were used to check the assumption of a constant heat effect over the warm season. RESULTS: The city-specific exposure-response functions have a V shape, with a change-point that varied among cities. The meta-analytic estimate of the threshold was 29.4 degrees C for Mediterranean cities and 23.3 degrees C for north-continental cities. The estimated overall change in all natural mortality associated with a 1 degrees C increase in maximum apparent temperature above the city-specific threshold was 3.12% (95% credibility interval = 0.60% to 5.72%) in the Mediterranean region and 1.84% (0.06% to 3.64%) in the north-continental region. Stronger associations were found between heat and mortality from respiratory diseases, and with mortality in the elderly. CONCLUSIONS: There is an important mortality effect of heat across Europe. The effect is evident from June through August; it is limited to the first week following temperature excess, with evidence of mortality displacement.

Objective: To evaluate our a priori hypothesis that identifiable subgroups of asthmatic children are more likely to wheeze with exposure to ambient air pollution. Methods: A cohort of 315 children with asthma, aged 6 to 11 years, was recruited for longitudinal follow-up in Fresno, CA. During the baseline visit, children were administered a respiratory symptom questionnaire and allergen skin-prick testing. Three times a year, participants completed 14-day panels during which they answered symptom questions twice daily.

Results: For the group as a whole, wheeze was significantly associated with short-term exposures to NO2 (OR=1.10 for 8.7 ppb increase, 95%CI=1.02-1.20) and PM10-2.5 (OR=1.11 for 14.7 microg/m3 increase, 95% CI=1.01-1.22).

Objectives: We hypothesized that acute increases in fine PM (PM2.5) would be associated with increased risk of MI and that chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and diabetes would confer increased susceptibility to PM2.5. We also explored whether both transmural and non-transmural infarctions were acutely associated with ambient PM2.5 concentrations. Methods: We studied all hospital admissions for first acute MI (2004-2006) of adult residents of New Jersey, living within 10km of a PM2.5 monitoring site (N=5864), and ambient measurements of PM2.5, nitrogen dioxide, sulfur dioxide, carbon monoxide, and ozone. Results: Using a time-stratified case-crossover design and conditional logistic regression, each interquartile increase in PM2.5 concentration (10 microg/m3) in the 24 hours before emergency room arrival for MI was not associated with an increased risk of MI overall, but was associated with increased risk of a transmural infarction. There was no association between the same increase in PM2.5 and risk of a non-transmural infarction. Further, subjects with COPD appeared to be particularly susceptible, but not subjects with diabetes. Conclusions: This PM/transmural infarction association is consistent with earlier studies of PM and total MI. The lack of association with non-transmural infarctions suggests that future studies investigating the triggering of MI by ambient PM2.5 concentrations should be stratified by infarction type.",6.3.2.5,Myocardial Infarction (MI),0,0

In this study, comparative proteomic approach was employed to explore the differential changes of proteins in O(3) target structures such as leaf and chloroplasts of soybean seedlings. Acute O(3) exposure (120 ppb) for 3 days did not cause any visible symptoms in developing leaves. However, higher amounts of reactive oxygen species and lipid peroxidation indicated that severe oxidative burst occurred. Immunoblot analysis of O(3)-induced known proteins revealed that proteins were modulated before symptoms became visible. Proteomic analysis identified a total of 20 and 32 differentially expressed proteins from O(3)-treated leaf and chloroplast, respectively. Proteins associated with photosynthesis, including photosystem I/II and carbon assimilation decreased following exposure to O(3). In contrast, proteins involved in antioxidant defense and carbon metabolism increased. The activity of enzymes involved in carbohydrate metabolism increased following exposure to O(3), which is consistent with the decrease in starch and increase in sucrose concentrations. Taken together, these results suggest that carbon allocation is tightly programmed, and starch degradation probably feeds the tricarboxylic acid cycle while the photosynthesis pathway is severely affected during O(3) stress.",9.3.3.2,Gene and Protein Expression Changes in Response to Ozone,0,0

Measurements from 13 monitors for particulate matter <10?m (PM(10)), ozone, nitrogen dioxide, sulfur dioxide, and carbon monoxide were used to estimate individual-level exposures by averaging across values from all monitors, selecting the value from the nearest monitor, inverse distance weighting, and kriging. We assessed associations between pollutants and lung function in linear regression models, controlling for age, sex, and body mass index. Cross-validation indicated that kriging provided the most accurate estimated exposures. FVC was associated with all air pollutants under all methods of estimating exposure. Only ozone was associated with FEV1. An 11ppb increase in lag-0-2 8-h maximum ozone was associated with a 6.1% (95% confidence interval 5.0, 7.3%) decrease in FVC and a 0.50% (95% confidence interval 0.03, 0.96%) decrease in FEV1, based on kriged exposures. Central health effect estimates were generally higher using exposures based on averaging across all monitors or kriging. Results based on the nearest monitor approach had the lowest variance.

The role of isoprene in plants is unclear, but many experiments showed that isoprene may have a role in protecting plants from thermal damage. A more general antioxidant action has been recently hypothesized on the basis of the protection offered by exogenous isoprene in nonemitting plants exposed to acute ozone doses. We inhibited the synthesis of endogenous isoprene by feeding fosmidomycin and observed that Phragmites australis leaves became more sensitive to ozone than those leaves forming isoprene. Photosynthesis, stomatal conductance, and fluorescence parameters were significantly affected by ozone only in leaves on which isoprene was not formed. The protective effect of isoprene was more evident when the leaves were exposed for a long time (8 h) to relatively low (100 nL L(-1)) ozone levels than when the exposure was short and acute (3 h at 300 nL L(-1)). Isoprene quenched the amount of H(2)O(2) formed in leaves and reduced lipid peroxidation of cellular membranes caused by ozone. These results indicate that isoprene may exert its protective action at the membrane level, although a similar effect could be obtained if isoprene reacted with ozone before forming active oxygen species.

Prominently, O-3 exposure caused specific foliar injury in both the wheat cultivars. Results also showed that O-3 stress significantly decreased photosynthetic rate, stomatal conductance, and chlorophyll fluorescence kinetics (F-v/F-m) in test cultivars. Biochemical evaluations further revealed a higher loss in photosynthetic pigments, whereas a significantly induced antioxidant system under elevated O-3 concentrations pointed toward an ability of O-3 to generate oxidative stress. 1-DGE analysis showed drastic reductions in the abundantly present ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (RuBisCO) large and small subunits. Western blot analysis confirmed induced accumulation of antioxidative enzymes like superoxide dismutase and ascorbate peroxidase protein(s) and common defense/stress-related thaumatin-like protein(s). 2-DGE analysis revealed a total of 38 differentially expressed protein spots, common in both the wheat cultivars.

OBJECTIVE: To assess the association of particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter of ?10?m (PM(10)) and ozone (O(3)) on infant mortality and its modification by SES.

METHODS: We evaluated the relationship of 24 h mean PM(10) and 1h daily maximum O(3) levels with 12?079 all-cause deaths (3903 respiratory deaths) among 1- to 11-month-old infants residing in the Mexico City Metropolitan Area between January 1997 and December 2005 using a case-crossover approach.

RESULTS: Single-effect models showed, for all-cause mortality, increases of 5.5% (95% CI 1% to 10%) at lag1 and 6.6% (2% to 11.4%) at lag2; cumulative exposure models (0-2 days) showed an increase of 6.3% (0.01% to 32.7%).

I investigated the role of diabetes, myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and pneumonia as modifiers of the risk of dying on an extreme temperature day. Hot days were defined as those greater than the 99th percentile of all days and cold days as those less than the 1st percentile.

The U.S. Surgeon General issued the Call to Action to Prevent and Decrease Overweight and Obesity in 2001, and in 2007, no state had met the Healthy People 2010 objective to reduce obesity prevalence among adults to 15%. Methods: CDC used 2009 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System survey data to update estimates of national and state-specific obesity prevalence. Obesity was calculated based on self-reported weight and height and defined as body mass index (weight [kg] / height [m]2) ?30. Results: Overall self-reported obesity prevalence in the United States was 26.7%. Non-Hispanic blacks (36.8%), Hispanics (30.7%), those who did not graduate from high school (32.9%), and persons aged 50--59 years (31.1%) and 60--69 years (30.9%) were disproportionally affected.

We examined effects of prenatal ambient pollution exposure on average birth weight and risk of low birth weight in full-term births.
Methods: We estimated average ambient air pollutant concentrations throughout pregnancy in the neighborhoods of women who delivered term singleton live births between 1996 and 2006 in California. We adjusted effect estimates of air pollutants on birth weight for infant characteristics, maternal characteristics, neighborhood socioeconomic factors, and year and season of birth.
Results: 3,545,177 singleton births had monitoring for at least one air pollutant within a 10 km radius of the tract or ZIP Code of the mother's residence. In multivariate models, pollutants were associated with decreased birth weight; -5.4 grams (95% confidence interval -6.8 g, -4.1 g) per ppm carbon monoxide, -9.0 g (-9.6 g, -8.4 g) per pphm nitrogen dioxide, -5.7 g (-6.6 g, -4.9 g) per pphm ozone, -7.7 g (-7.9 g, -6.6 g) per 10 ?g/m3 particulate matter under 10 ?m, -12.8 g (-14.3 g, -11.3 g) per 10 ?g/m3 particulate matter under 2.5 ?m, and -9.3 g (-10.7 g, -7.9 g) per 10 ?g/m3 of coarse particulate matter. With the exception of carbon monoxide, estimates were largely unchanged after controlling for co-pollutants. Effect estimates for the third trimester largely reflect the results seen from full pregnancy exposure estimates; greater variation in results is seen in effect estimates specific to the first and second trimesters.
Conclusions: This study indicates that maternal exposure to ambient air pollution results in modestly lower infant birth weight. A small decline in birth weight is unlikely to have clinical relevance for individual infants, and there is debate about whether a small shift in the population distribution of birth weight has broader health implications. However, the ubiquity of air pollution exposures, the responsiveness of pollutant levels to regulation, and the fact that the highest pollution levels in California are lower than those regularly experienced in other countries suggest that precautionary efforts to reduce pollutants may be beneficial for infant health from a population perspective.",7.4.3,Birth Weight,7.1.3.1,Biological Plausibility

To determine whether repeated episodic exposures to environmental pollutants during postnatal lung development alters airway mast cell abundance and distribution, we exposed infant rhesus monkeys to a known human allergen, house dust mite antigen (HDMA) and/or a known environmental pollutant, ozone (O3) and quantitatively compared the abundance of tryptase or chymase positive mast cells in three airway levels. Mast cells are resident in multiple compartments of the airway wall in infant rhesus monkeys raised from birth in filtered air.

Neither exposure to O3 nor HDMA+O3 increased mast cell accumulations in the airway wall. We conclude that during postnatal airway development: 1) mast cells are a resident airway cell population even in the absence of toxic air contaminants; 2) aeroallergen exposure alters large airway mast cell distribution and abundance, increasing chymase positive mast cells; 3) this response is attenuated by exposure to oxidant air pollutants.",7.2.3.2,Pulmonary Structure and Function: Evidence from Toxicological Studies and Nonhuman Primate Asthma Models,0,0

Methods: The role of GSTP1 was assessed in 131 workers exposed to TDI, 92 with TDI-induced asthma and 39 asymptomatic subjects. The phenotype of the disease was characterized by using detailed clinical history, lung volumes, airway responsiveness to methacholine, and airway responsiveness to TDI. GST genotypes were determined by using PCR-based assays. Results: In patients exposed to TDI for 10 or more years, the frequency of the GSTP1 Val/Val genotype was lower in subjects who had asthma (odds ratio, 0.23; 95% confidence interval, 0.05-1.13; P = .074). Similarly, the frequency of this genotype was significantly lower in subjects with evidence of moderate-to-severe airway hyperresponsiveness to methacholine compared with the frequency in subjects with normal or mild hyperresponsiveness (P = .033). Conclusion: These data suggest that homozygosity for the GSTP1*Val allele confers protection against TDI-induced asthma and airway hyperresponsiveness. This view is supported by the finding that the protective effect increases in proportion to the duration of exposure to TDI.",6.2.4.1,Children with Asthma,0,0

We previously showed that alleles of GSTP1 that encode the Ile105-->Val105 substitution are associated with the asthma phenotypes of atopy and bronchial hyperresponsiveness (BHR). However, a further polymorphic site (Ala114-->Val114) has been identified that results in the following alleles: GSTP1*A (wild-type Ile105-->Ala114), GSTP1*B (Val105-->Ala114), GSTP1*C (Val105-->Val114) and GSTP1*D (Ile105-->Val114). METHODS: Because full identification of GSTP1 alleles may identify stronger links with asthma phenotypes, we describe an amplification refractory mutation system (ARMS) assay that allows identification of all genotypes. We explored whether the GSTP1 substitutions influence susceptibility to asthma, atopy and BHR. RESULTS: Among 191 atopic nonasthmatic, atopic asthmatic and nonatopic nonasthmatic individuals, none had the BD, CD, or DD genotypes. GSTP1 BC was significantly associated with reduced risk for atopy (P = 0.031). Compared with AA, trend test analysis identified a significant decrease in the frequency of GSTP1 BC with increasing severity of BHR (P = 0.031). Similarly, the frequency of GSTP1 AA increased with increasing BHR.

Using an in vivo model (SKH-1 hairless mice), the interaction between O3 exposure (0. 5 ppm ? 6 h/day) and age was examined in relation to cutaneous wound healing. Compared to younger (8 weeks) mice, older (18 months) mice exposed to O3 (day 0 to day 9 after wounding) exhibited delayed wound closure, increased lipid peroxidation (measured as 4-HNE protein adducts) and protein oxidation (measured as carbonyls concentration) and decreased levels of P-I?B? and TGF? protein.

Methods: We conducted secondary analyses of data on blood pressure and blood biochemistry markers from the Social Environment and Biomarkers of Aging Study in Taiwan and air pollution data from the Taiwan Environmental Protection Administration in 2000. Associations of 1-year averaged criteria air pollutants (particulate matter with aerodynamic diameters <10??m (PM(10)) and <2.5??m (PM(2.5)), ozone (O(3)), nitrogen dioxide (NO(2)), sulfur dioxide and carbon monoxide) with systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, total cholesterol, triglycerides, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, fasting glucose, haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), interleukin 6 (IL-6) and neutrophils were explored by applying generalised additive models. 

Results: After controlling for potential confounders, we observed that increased 1-year averaged particulate air pollutants (PM(10) and PM(2.5)) and NO(2) were associated with elevated blood pressure, total cholesterol, fasting glucose, HbA1c, IL-6 and neutrophils. Associations of increased 1-year averaged O(3) with elevated blood pressure, total cholesterol, fasting glucose, HbA1c and neutrophils were also observed. In particular, our two-pollutant models showed that PM(2.5) was more significantly associated with end-point variables than two gaseous pollutants, O(3) and NO(2).

An experiment was conducted in the fall of 1995 under open field filter frames using cellulose diacetate and Mylar filters to transmit and exclude natural UV-B irradiation, respectively. Even though growth under these conditions was slow and erratic owing to lack of temperature control, growth suppression as indicated by rosette diameter and harvest fresh weights provided a sensitive indicator of UV-B stress. This experience led to development of temperature-controlled Teflon-covered field chambers that admit up to 88% of the total daily PAR and about 85% of ambient UV-B, omit predators, and provide a generally stable environment for quantitative plant growth studies. The chambers were designed to facilitate the addition of optical filters and/or shade cloth and to accommodate control of the gaseous environment for pollutant and climate change studies and to provide clean air for other experiments. Three additional experiments were conducted in these chambers. Measurements of rosette diameter, weights of various aboveground plant parts, and plant height were evaluated as potential methods of comparing growth sensitivities of the tt-5 mutant to UV-B radiation. The weight of the reproductive parts (flowers and siliques) as a fraction of the total (e.g. harvest index) was consistently and negatively affected by solar UV-B, as was simple plant height. However, in no case, even in the virtual absence of UV-B, was growth of tt-5 comparable to that of Ler.

This study, therefore, measured amino acid levels, arginase activity, and nitric oxide metabolites in the blood of patients with asthma, as well as NO in exhaled breath. Although levels of virtually all amino acids were reduced, patients with asthma exhibited a striking reduction in plasma arginine levels compared with normal control subjects without asthma (45 +/- 22 vs. 94 +/- 29 microM, p < 0.0001), and serum arginase activity was elevated (1.6 +/- 0.8 vs. 0.5 +/- 0.3 micromol/ml/hour, asthma vs. control, p < 0.0001).

Data sources and extraction: From bibliographic searches we extracted ten original epidemiological studies that examined the association between congenital anomaly risk and concentrations of air pollutants. Meta-analyses were conducted if at least four studies published risk estimates for the same pollutant and anomaly group. Summary risk estimates were calculated for 1) risk at high versus low exposure level in each study, and 2) risk per unit increase in continuous pollutant concentration. 

Data synthesis: Each individual study reported statistically significantly increased risks for some combinations of air pollutants and congenital anomalies, among many combinations tested. In meta-analyses, NO2 and SO2 exposures were related to increases in risk of coarctation of the aorta (OR per 10 ppb NO2=1.17, 95%CI 1.00-1.36; OR per 1 ppb SO2=1.07, 95%CI 1.01, 1.13) and tetralogy of Fallot (OR per 10ppb NO2=1.20, 95%CI 1.02, 1.42; OR per 1 ppb SO2=1.03, 95%CI 1.01, 1.05), and PM10 exposure to an increased risk of atrial septal defects (OR per 10 ?g/m3=1.14, 95%CI 1.01, 1.28).

Objectives: We specifically aimed to evaluate whether exposure markers of primary organic aerosols and ultrafine particles were more strongly associated with ST-segment depression of ? 1 mm than were secondary organic aerosols or PM2.5 (particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter ? 2.5 ?m) mass.

Methods: We evaluated relations of air pollutants to ambulatory electrocardiographic evidence of cardiac ischemia over 10 days in 38 subjects without ST depression on baseline electrocardiographs. Exposures were measured outdoors in retirement communities in the Los Angeles basin, including daily size-fractionated particle mass and hourly markers of primary and secondary organic aerosols and gases. Generalized estimating equations were used to estimate odds of hourly ST-segment depression (? 1 mm) from hourly air pollution exposures and to estimate relative rates of daily counts of ST-segment depression from daily average exposures, controlling for potential confounders.

Results: We found significant positive associations of hourly ST-segment depression with markers ?of combustion-related aerosols and gases averaged 1-hr through 3-4 days, but not secondary (photochemically aged) organic aerosols or ozone. The odds ratio per interquartile increase in 2-day average primary organic carbon (5.2 ?g/m3) was 15.4 (95% confidence interval, 3.5-68.2). Daily counts of ST-segment depression were consistently associated with primary combustion markers and 2-day average quasi-ultrafine particles < 0.25 ?m.

Exposure to ozone therefore, may potentiate the airway response to allergens. We undertook this study to investigate the effect of ozone exposure on airway response to ovalbumin in sensitized guinea pigs and its modulation by dietary supplementation with antioxidant vitamins C and E. METHODS: After in vivo measurements of specific airways conductance (SGaw) and airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR) to inhaled histamine, guinea pigs were sensitized to ovalbumin and divided into three groups: (i) sensitized; (ii) sensitized and exposed daily to ozone; and (iii) sensitized, exposed daily to ozone and given dietary supplementation with vitamin C, 2 mg/kg body wt and E, 7 IU/kg body wt. A control group of nonsensitized animals was included. After 4 wk, AHR was measured again and animals were challenged with inhaled ovalbumin. Changes in SGaw were followed for early and late airway bronchoconstrictive responses. The following measurements were obtained: (i) parameters of oxidative stress--plasma malonaldehyde (MDA) as marker of lipid peroxidation and superoxide anion generation by leukocytes and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) cells; (ii) antioxidant status: red cell superoxide dismutase (SOD); and (iii) glutathione peroxidase (GPx). BAL cytology was studied. RESULTS: Ozone exposure resulted in an increase in AHR and early and late bronchoconstrictive responses after ovalbumin challenge, greater superoxide anion generation in BAL cells, higher plasma MDA levels and decrease in red cell SOD activity.

If hippocampal structural variations are causing behavioral variations, one must predict positive correlations between the extent of the IIP-MF and performance in swimming navigation. Thus, the authors studied learning and reversal learning of swimming navigation in mice in which the size of the IIP-MF had been randomized by means of systematic crosses and in 2 mouse strains known for differential infrapyramidal projections (C57BL/6 and DBA/2). In 19 random-bred mice (9 male, 10 female), the extent of the IIP-MF showed negative correlations with swimming time after platform reversal (day 4: r = -0.50, P < .03; day 5 r = -0.73, P < .001), but none during acquisition of the task. In addition, statistical analysis suggested an influence of asymmetrically distributed mossy fiber projections during reversal learning. The strain comparison between 18 DBA/2 and 16 C57BL/6 male mice confirmed these results: no strain difference during days 1-3, and a significantly faster swimming time in the strain C57BL/6 (with large IIP-MF) at day 5 (second day of reversal), associated with significantly more crossings of the former platform location during the early phases of reversal learning. This latter measure was also negatively correlated with asymmetry of the IIP-MF in both strains. Finally, variations of the IIP-MF were correlated partially with adjustment of swimming speed that appeared to depend on size and asymmetry of CA4 as well.

Tagging single-nucleotide polymorphisms in glutathione metabolism pathway genes GSS, GSR, GCLM, and GCLC were genotyped by GoldenGate assay (Illumina, San Diego, CA). Mixed regression models were used to determine whether particular haplotypes were associated with FEV(1), maximal mid-expiratory flow rate, and FVC and whether any of the genetic associations varied with levels of exposure to air pollutants.

We studied effects of increased background [O3] (up to [ambient] ? 2) and increased N deposition (up to +50 kg ha?1 a?1) on mature, subalpine grassland during the third treatment year. During 10 days and 13 nights, distributed evenly over the growth period of 2006, we measured ecosystem-level CO2 exchange using a static cuvette. Light dependency of gross primary production (GPP) and temperature dependency of ecosystem respiration rates (Reco) were established. Soil temperature, soil water content, and solar radiation were monitored. Using Reco and GPP values, we calculated seasonal net ecosystem production (NEP), based on hourly averages of global radiation and soil temperature. Differences in NEP were compared with differences in soil organic C after 5 years of treatment. The high [O3] had no effect on aboveground dry matter productivity (DM), but seasonal mean rates of both Reco and GPP decreased ca. 8%. NEP indicated an unaltered growing season CO2?C balance. High N treatment, with a +31% increase in DM, mean Reco increased ca. 3%, but GPP decreased ca. 4%. Consequently, seasonal NEP yielded a 53.9 g C m?2 (?22.05) C loss compared with control. Independent of treatment, we observed a negative NEP of 146.4 g C m?2 (?15.3). Carbon loss was likely due to a transient management effect, equivalent to a shift from pasture to hay meadow and a drought effect, specific to the 2006 summer climate. We argue that this resulted from strongly intensified soil microbial respiration, following mitigation of nutrient limitation. There was no interaction between O3 and N treatments. Thus, during the 2006 growing season, the subalpine grassland lost >2% of total topsoil organic C as respired CO2, with increased N deposition responsible for one-third of that loss.",9.4.3.4,Ecosystem Productivity and Carbon Sequestration,0,0

Although the deleterious effects of air pollution from fossil-fuel combustion have been demonstrated in many Western nations, few comparable studies have been conducted in Asia. Time-series studies of daily mortality in Asian cities can contribute important new information to the existing body of knowledge about air pollution and health. Not only can these studies verify important health effects of air pollution in local regions in Asia, they can also help determine the relevance of existing air pollution studies to mortality and morbidity for policymaking and environmental controls. In addition, the studies can help identify factors that might modify associations between air pollution and health effects in various populations and environmental conditions. Collaborative multicity studies in Asia-especially when designed, conducted, and analyzed using a common protocol-will provide more robust air pollution effect estimates for the region as well as relevant, supportable estimates of local adverse health effects needed by environmental and public-health policymakers. SPECIFIC OBJECTIVES: The Public Health and Air Pollution in Asia (PAPA*) project, sponsored by the Health Effects Institute, consisted of four studies designed to assess the effects of air pollution on mortality in four large Asian cities, namely Bangkok, in Thailand, and Hong Kong, Shanghai, and Wuhan, in China. In the PAPA project, a Common Protocol was developed based on methods developed and tested in NMMAPS, APHEA, and time-series studies in the literature to help ensure that the four studies could be compared with each other and with previous studies by following an established protocol. The Common Protocol (found at the end of this volume) is a set of prescriptive instructions developed for the studies and used by the investigators in each city. It is flexible enough to allow for adjustments in methods to optimize the fit of health-effects models to each city's data set. It provides the basis for generating reproducible results in each city and for meta-estimates from combined data. By establishing a common methodology, factors that might influence the differences in results from previous studies can more easily be explored. Administrative support was provided to ensure that the highest quality data were used in the analysis. It is anticipated that the PAPA results will contribute to the international scientific discussion of how to conduct and interpret time-series studies of air pollution and will stimulate the development of high-quality routine systems for recording daily deaths and hospital admissions for time-series analysis.<br /><br /> Mortality data were retrieved from routine databases with underlying causes of death coded using the World Health Organization (WHO) International Classification of Diseases, 9th revision or 10th revision (ICD-9, ICD-10). Air quality measurements included nitrogen dioxide (NO2), sulfur dioxide (SO2), particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter < or = 10 microm (PM10), and ozone (O3) and were obtained from several fixed-site air monitoring stations that were located throughout the metropolitan areas of the four cities and that met the standards of procedures for quality assurance and quality control carried out by local government units in each city. Using the Common Protocol, an optimized core model was established for each city to assess the effects of each of the four air pollutants on daily mortality using generalized linear modeling with adjustments for time trend, seasonality, and other time-varying covariates by means of a natural-spline smoothing function. The models were adjusted to suit local situations by correcting for influenza activity, autocorrelation, and special weather conditions. Researchers in Hong Kong, for example, used influenza activity based on frequency of respiratory mortality; researchers in Hong Kong and Shanghai used autoregressive terms for daily outcomes at lag days; and researchers in Wuhan used additional smoothing for periods with extreme weather conditions.<br /><br /> For mortality due to all natural (nonaccidental) causes at all ages, the effects of air pollutants per 10-microg/m3 increase in concentration was found to be higher in Bangkok than in the three Chinese cities, with the exception of the effect of NO2 in Wuhan. The magnitude of the effects for cardiovascular and respiratory mortality were generally higher than for all natural mortality at all ages. In addition, the effects associated with PM10 and O3 in all natural, cardiovascular; and respiratory mortality were found to be higher in Bangkok than in the three Chinese cities. The explanation for these three findings might be related to consistently higher daily mean temperatures in Bangkok, variations in average time spent outdoors by the susceptible populations, and the fact that less air conditioning is available and used in Bangkok than in the other cities. However, when pollutant concentrations were incorporated into the excess risk estimates through the use of interquartile range (IQR), the excess risk was more comparable across the four cities. We found that the increases in effects among older age groups were greater in Bangkok than in the other three cities. After excluding data on extremely high concentrations of PM10 in Bangkok, the effect estimate associated with PM10 concentrations decreased in Bangkok (suggesting a convex relationship between risk and PM10, where risk levels off at high concentrations) instead of increasing, as it did in the other cities. This leveling off of effect estimates at high concentrations might be related to differences in vulnerability and exposure of the population to air pollution as well as to the sources of the air pollutant. IMPLICATIONS OF THE STUDY: The PAPA project is the first coordinated Asian multicity air pollution study ever published; this signifies the beginning of an era of cooperation and collaboration in Asia, with the development of a common protocol for coordination, data management, and analysis. The results of the study demonstrated that air pollution in Asia is a significant public health burden, especially given the high concentrations of pollutants and high-density populations in major cities. When compared with the effect estimates reported in the research literature of North America and Western Europe, the study's effect estimates for PM10 were generally similar and the effect estimates for gaseous pollutants were relatively higher. In Bangkok, however, a tropical city where total exposures to outdoor pollution might be higher than in most other cities, the observed effects were greater than those reported in the previous (i.e., Western) studies. In general, the results suggested that, even though social and environmental conditions across Asia might vary, it is still generally appropriate to apply to Asia the effect estimates for other health outcomes from previous studies in the West. The results also strongly support the adoption of the global air quality guidelines recently announced by WHO.",6.2.8,Respiratory Mortality,0,0

METHODS: Emergency department visits for pediatric asthma exacerbations were collected from Atlanta hospitals. Concentrations of carbon monoxide, nitrogen dioxide, ozone, sulfur dioxide, particulate matter less than 10 microns in diameter (PM10), particulate matter less than 2.5 microns in diameter (PM2.5), and the PM2.5 components elemental carbon, organic carbon, and sulfate were obtained from networks of ambient air quality monitors. For each pollutant we created three different daily metrics. For one metric we used the measurements from a centrally-located monitor; for the second we averaged measurements across the network of monitors; and for the third we estimated the population-weighted average concentration using an isotropic spatial model. Rate ratios for each of the metrics were estimated from time-series models. RESULTS: For pollutants with relatively homogeneous spatial distributions we observed only small differences in the rate ratio across the three metrics. Conversely, for spatially heterogeneous pollutants we observed larger differences in the rate ratios. For a given pollutant, the strength of evidence for an association (i.e., chi-square statistics) tended to be similar across metrics. CONCLUSIONS: Given that the chi-square statistics were similar across the metrics, the differences in the rate ratios for the spatially heterogeneous pollutants may seem like a relatively small issue. However, these differences are important for health benefits analyses, where results from epidemiological studies on the health effects of pollutants (per unit change in concentration) are used to predict the health impacts of a reduction in pollutant concentrations. We discuss the relative merits of the different metrics as they pertain to time-series studies and health benefits analyses.",6.2.7.3,Emergency Department Visit Studies,0,0

Methods: Daily levels of urban O3 pollution, the incidence of first-ever, recurrent, fatal and non-fatal ischaemic cerebrovascular events (ICVE) and myocardial infarction (MI) were correlated using a case-crossover design. The authors analysed 1574 ICVE and 913 MI that occurred in Dijon, France (150?000 inhabitants) from 2001 to 2007. Sulfur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), carbon monoxide (CO) and particulate matter with an aerodiameter of ?10??g/m3 (PM10) were used to create bi-pollutant models. Using the adjusted OR, the effects of O3 exposure were calculated for every 10??g/m3 increase in pollutants in multivariate logistic models adjusted for temperature, humidity, flu outbreaks and holidays.

Results: The authors found a significant association between exposure to O3 and recurrent ICVE with a 3-day lag (OR=1.115; 95% CI 1.027 to 1.209). The direction and magnitude of the association between exposure to O3 and recurrent MI were similar but not statistically significant. For incident events, the authors detected only a non-significant association for ICVE with a 2-day lag (OR=1.041; 95% CI 0.996 to 1.089). In the subgroup analysis for ICVE, the authors observed an increased association with cardiovascular risk factors (OR=1.523; 95% CI 1.149 to 2.018). For MI, the authors found an association with O3 when hypercholesterolaemia was present (OR=1.111; 95% CI 1.020 to 1.211), and the association became stronger with the number of cardiovascular risk factors. The authors found a marked dose?response relationship.

Conclusion: Recurrent ICVE and MI could be triggered by short-term exposure to even low levels of O3, especially among subjects with severe vascular risk factors.",6.3.2.3,Stroke,4.1.5.2,Epidemiologic Panel Studies

A proteome study based on highly sensitive two-dimensional fluorescence difference gel electrophoresis (2-D DIGE) was performed to identify protein changes in European beech, the most important deciduous tree in Central Europe. Main emphasis was on identifying differentially expressed proteins after long-time period of ozone exposure under natural conditions rather than short-term responses or reactions under controlled conditions.

Methods Modelled outdoor NO(2), O(3) and PM(10) estimates were linked to each residential address using the 4?km grid air pollutant surface developed by the French Institute of Environment in 2004.

The specific factors underlying this differential susceptibility are unknown but may be related to air pollutant-induced nasal alterations during postnatal development that impair the normal physiological functions (e.g., filtration and mucociliary clearance) serving to protect the more distal airways from inhaled xenobiotics. In adult animal models, chronic ozone exposure is associated with adaptations leading to a decrease in airway injury. The purpose of our study was to determine whether cyclic ozone exposure induces persistent morphological and biochemical effects on the developing nasal airways of infant monkeys early in life. Infant (180-day-old) rhesus macaques were exposed to 5 consecutive days of O(3) [0.5 parts per million (ppm), 8 h/day; &quot;1-cycle&quot;] or filtered air (FA) or 11 biweekly cycles of O(3) (FA days 1-9; 0.5 ppm, 8 h/day on days 10-14; &quot;11-cycle&quot;).

Mucosal samples from the right nasal passage were processed for GSH, GSSG, ascorbate (AH(2)), and uric acid (UA) concentration. Eleven-cycle O(3) induced persistent rhinitis, squamous metaplasia, and epithelial hyperplasia in the anterior nasal airways of infant monkeys, resulting in a 39% increase in the numeric density of epithelial cells. Eleven-cycle O(3) also induced a 65% increase in GSH concentrations at this site. The persistence of epithelial hyperplasia was positively correlated with changes in GSH.

The pulmonary response of pups was assessed following a single 3-h exposure to air or 0.6 ppm O? on d 13 after birth. In all, 4 exposure groups were evaluated: (1) Air/Air (in utero air and postnatal air), (2) Air/O? (in utero air and postnatal O?), (3) TS/Air (in utero TS and postnatal air), and (4) TS/O? (in utero TS and postnatal O?). Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) was performed, and BAL cells and fluid were analyzed. Data revealed a significant increase in polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN) and total BALF protein in the Air/O? group compared to the Air/Air control, reflecting the inflammatory and cytotoxic effects of O?. However, in utero exposure to TS attenuated PMN infiltration into the air spaces for recovery in the BAL of TS/O? pups. Lung tissue myeloperoxidase activity significantly increased only in the TS/O? group but not in Air/O? pups, thus suggesting that PMN are sequestered in the lung tissue and that the in utero TS likely inhibits O?-mediated influx of PMN into the air spaces. Lung tissue analyses further showed a significant rise in manganese superoxide dismutase (SOD) protein and a decrease in extracellular SOD protein in the Air/O? group, suggesting oxidative effects of O?. Interestingly, in utero TS exposure again suppressed these effects in the TS/O? group. Overall, results suggest that in utero exposure to TS alone produced minimal acute pulmonary effects in newborn rats, but modulated adverse effects of postnatal O? exposure. The results are contrary to the interactive toxic responses predicted for sequential exposures to TS and O?, and may represent the development of &quot;cross-tolerance.&quot;",7.4.8,Developmental Respiratory Effects,0,0

Female Wistar rats were exposed at 0.12ppm of ozone during 6h per day for 15days. Prolonged ozone exposure, though not continuous, produced remarkable behavioural disturbances with an increase in drinking, grooming and resting, and a reduction of rearing, jumping-play and locomotor activities. Besides, ozone exposure was accompanied by increased plasma levels of corticosterone and free triiodothyronine (FT3). Expression of myosin heavy chain (MHC) was significantly affected in three of the five muscles studied. MHC 2B decreased significantly to the benefit of MHC 2A in diaphragm compared to control. MHC 2X increased in Anterior Digastric and decreased in Masseter Superficialis under ozone, to the benefit of MHC 2B in Masseter Superficialis. The plasma corticosterone level increase suggested that prolonged exposure to ozone was stressful. This increase could explain also the increased levels of FT3.

Ozone (O(3) ) and endotoxin are common environmental contaminants that cause asthma exacerbation. These pollutants have similar phenotype response characteristics, including induction of neutrophilic inflammation, changes in airway macrophage immunophenotypes, and ability to enhance response to inhaled allergen. Evoked phenotyping studies of volunteers exposed to O(3) and endotoxin were used to identify the response characteristics of volunteers to these pollutants. New studies support the hypotheses that similar innate immune and oxidant processes modulate response to these agents. These include TLR4 and inflammasome-mediated signaling and cytokine production. Innate immune responses are also impacted by oxidative stress. It is likely that continued discovery of common molecular processes which modulate response to these pollutants will occur. Understanding the pathways that modulate response to pollutants will also allow for discovery of genetic and epigenetic factors that regulate response to these pollutants and determine risk of disease exacerbation. Additionally, defining the mechanisms of response will allow rational selection of interventions to examine. Interventions focused on inhibition of Toll-like receptor 4 and inflammasome represent promising new approaches to preventing pollutant-induced asthma exacerbations.

We investigated the following diseases, as coded in the ninth revision of the International Classification of Diseases: hypertensive disease (codes 401-405); ischemic heart disease (codes 410-414); other cardiac diseases, including heart failure (codes 426-428); chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and allied conditions, including bronchitis and asthma (codes 490-496); and pneumoconiosis and other lung diseases due to external agents (codes 500-507). We evaluated ozone data from air quality monitoring stations in the study area, together with data collected through HYbrid Single-Particle Lagrangian Integrated Trajectory (HYSPLIT) model analysis of air mass circulation and synoptic-scale zonal wind from National Centers for Environmental Prediction data. High ozone levels in rural areas were attributed to the dispersion of pollutants induced by local circulation, as well as by mesoscale and synoptic scale processes. The fires of 2005 increased the levels of pollutants resulting from the direct emission of gases and particles into the atmosphere, especially when there were incoming frontal systems.

We developed a protocol to estimate odds ratios (ORs) for the association between particulate matter ? 10 ?m in aerodynamic diameter (PM10) and low birth weight (LBW) among term births, adjusted first for socioeconomic status (SES) and second for additional location-specific variables.Results: Among locations with data for the PM10 analysis, ORs estimating the relative risk of term LBW associated with a 10-?g/m3 increase in average PM10 concentration during pregnancy, adjusted for SES, ranged from 0.63 [95% confidence interval (CI), 0.30-1.35] for the Netherlands to 1.15 (95% CI, 0.61-2.18) for Vancouver, with six research groups reporting statistically significant adverse associations.

<br>

<br>Location
<br>
<br>Continental China.
<br>
<br>Methods
<br>
<br>Using the dynamic land ecosystem model (DLEM) in conjunction with 10-km-resolution gridded historical data sets (tropospheric O-3 concentrations, climate variability/change, and other environmental factors such as land-cover/land-use change (LCLUC), increasing CO2 and nitrogen deposition), we conducted nine simulation experiments to: (1) investigate the temporo-spatial patterns of NPP and NCE in China's forest ecosystems from 1961-2005; and (2) quantify the effects of tropospheric O-3 pollution alone or in combination with climate variability and other environmental stresses on forests' NPP and NCE.
<br>
<br>Results
<br>
<br>China's forests acted as a carbon sink during 1961-2005 as a result of the combined effects of O-3, climate, CO2, nitrogen deposition and LCLUC. However, simulated results indicated that elevated O-3 caused a 7.7% decrease in national carbon storage, with O-3-induced reductions in NCE (Pg C year-1) ranging from 0.4-43.1% among different forest types. Sensitivity experiments showed that climate change was the dominant factor in controlling changes in temporo-spatial patterns of annual NPP. The combined negative effects of O-3 pollution and climate change on NPP and NCE could be largely offset by the positive fertilization effects of nitrogen deposition and CO2.
<br>
<br>Main conclusions
<br>
<br>In the future, tropospheric O-3 should be taken into account in order to fully understand the variations of carbon sequestration capacity of forests and assess the vulnerability of forest ecosystems to climate change and air pollution. Reducing air pollution in China is likely to increase the resilience of forests to climate change.

This is due in part to technical limitations of traditional approaches, in which only a small fraction of neurobiologically relevant proteins, mRNAs or metabolites can be assessed at a time. With the development and refinement of proteomic technologies that enable simultaneous quantitative assessment of hundreds to thousands of proteins, neuroproteomic studies of brain aging and cognitive decline are becoming more widespread. This review focuses on the contributions of neuroproteomic investigations to advances in our understanding of age-related deficits of hippocampus-dependent spatial learning and memory. Accumulating neuroproteomic data demonstrate that hippocampal aging involves common themes of dysregulated metabolism, increased oxidative stress, altered protein processing, and decreased synaptic function. Additionally, growing evidence suggests that cognitive decline does not represent a ""more aged"" phenotype, but rather is associated with specific neuroproteomic changes that occur in addition to age-related alterations. Understanding if and how age-related changes in the hippocampal neuroproteome contribute to cognitive decline and elucidating the pathways and processes that lead to cognitive decline are critical objectives that remain to be achieved.

OBJECTIVES: To investigate differences in DC-expressed costimulatory molecules and DC-secreted cytokines between allergic asthmatics and healthy donors, and their influence on the Th1- and Th2-type cytokine balance.

METHODS: Circulating monocytes from patients with allergic asthma and healthy donors were cultured with GM-CSF and IL-4, respectively, for 5 days and subsequently with lipopolysaccharide for 2 days to create mature DCs (mDCs). CD1a, CD83, CD40 and CD86 expression on mDCs was examined using a fluorescence-activated cell sorter. IL-12 and IL-10 secreted by mDCs were measured by ELISA. Naive cord blood T cells were primed by mDCs from two groups, and IL-4 and IFN-gamma production by polarized T-helper cells (Th) was measured by ELISA.

RESULTS: (1) CD86 expression on mDCs from allergic asthmatics was higher than that from healthy donors. (2) IL-12, IL-12p40 and IL-10 production by mDCs from allergic asthmatics was significantly lower than that from healthy donors, respectively.

OBJECTIVE: We investigated whether ozone was associated with survival in four cohorts of persons with specific diseases in 105 US cities, treating ozone as a time varying exposure. METHODS: We used Medicare data (1985-2006), and constructed cohorts of persons hospitalized with chronic conditions that might predispose to ozone effects: chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), diabetes, congestive heart failure (CHF), and myocardial infarction (MI). Yearly warm-season average ozone was merged to the individual follow up in each city. We applied Cox's proportional hazard model for each cohort within each city, adjusting for individual risk factors, temperature and city specific long term trends. RESULTS: We found significant associations with a hazard ratio for mortality of 1.06 (95% Confidence Interval (CI): 1.03, 1.08) per 5 ppb increase in summer average ozone for persons with CHF, of 1.09 (95% CI: 1.06, 1.12) with MI, of 1.07 (95% CI: 1.04, 1.09) with COPD, and of 1.07 (95% CI: 1.05, 1.10) for diabetics.

In the simulations, nitrogen deposition and fertilizer applications together accounted for 61 percent of the net carbon storage in China's land ecosystems in recent decades, with atmospheric CO2 increases and land use also functioning to stimulate carbon storage. The size of the modeled carbon sink over the period 1961?2005 was reduced by both ozone pollution and climate change. The modeled carbon sink in response to per unit nitrogen deposition shows a leveling off or a decline in some areas in recent years, although the nitrogen input levels have continued to increase.",9.4.3.5,Summary,0,0

We investigated the effects of ozone on heart rate (HR) and repolarisation parameters in potentially susceptible populations.
Methods: Between March 2007 and December 2008, 363 ECG recordings including >2000 1 h intervals were measured in 64 individuals with type 2 diabetes or impaired glucose tolerance and in 46 healthy individuals with a potential genetic predisposition on the detoxification pathways from Augsburg, Germany. Associations between 1 h averages of ozone and HR, Bazett-corrected QT-interval (QTc), T-wave amplitude and T-wave complexity were analysed using additive mixed models. A variable indicating season and participants' location during the 1 h ECG recordings (summer and outdoors vs winter or indoors) was used as a potential ozone effect modifier.
Results: We observed concurrent and 1-4 h lagged increases in HR of 0.5-0.7% for each 20 ?g/m(3) increase in ozone. These effects were stronger (1.0-1.2%) when participants were outdoors during the summer. We detected in all participants a concurrent (-1.31%; 95% CI -2.19% to -0.42%) and 1 h lagged (-1.32%; -2.19% to -0.45%) T-wave flattening. Elevated ozone levels were associated with 1 h (2.12%; 0.81 to 3.52) and 2 h lagged (1.89%; 0.55% to 3.26%) increases in T-wave complexity. However, no effects were seen for QTc. Ozone effects were generally more pronounced in individuals with metabolic disorders than a potential genetic predisposition.
Conclusions: Changes in repolarisation might contribute to underlying pathophysiological changes associated with the link between elevated ozone levels and reported adverse cardiovascular outcomes.",6.3.2.2,Heart Rate/Heart Rate Variability,0,0

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS We followed 57,053 participants of the Danish Diet, Cancer, and Health cohort in the Danish National Diabetes Register between baseline (1993-1997) and 27 June 2006. We estimated the mean levels of nitrogen dioxide (NO(2)) at the residential addresses of the cohort participants since 1971 and modeled the association between NO(2) and diabetes incidence with a Cox regression model, separately for two definitions of diabetes: all cases and a more strict definition where unconfirmed cases were excluded. RESULTS Over a mean follow-up of 9.7 years of 51,818 eligible subjects, there were 4,040 (7.8%) incident diabetes cases in total and 2,877 (5.5%) with confirmed diagnoses. Air pollution was not associated with all diabetes cases (hazard ratio 1.00 [95% CI 0.97-1.04] per interquartile range of 4.9 ?g/m(3) mean NO(2) levels since 1971), but a borderline statistically significant association was detected with confirmed cases of diabetes (1.04 [1.00-1.08]). Among confirmed diabetes cases, effects were significantly enhanced in nonsmokers (1.12 [1.05-1.20]) and physically active people (1.10 [1.03-1.16]).

The identification of novel genes for asthma suggests that many genes with small effects rather than few genes with strong effects contribute to the development of asthma. These genetic effects may in part differ with respect to a subject's environmental exposures, although some genes may also exert their effect independently of the environment. Whereas the geneticist uses highly advanced, rapid, comprehensive technologies to assess even subtle changes in the human genome, the researcher interested in environmental exposures is often confronted with crude information obtained from questionnaires or interviews. There is thus substantial need to develop better tools for individual exposure assessment in all relevant environmental fields. Despite these limitations, a number of important gene-environment interactions have been identified. These interactions point to the biology of environmental exposures as the involved genetic variation is suggestive of certain underlying mechanisms. Furthermore, the identification of subjects who are particularly susceptible to environmental hazards through genetic analyses helps to estimate better the strength of effect of environmental exposures.

Proposed exposure-based standards have led to concerns about the appropriateness of chamber studies. There has also been some debate about the importance of the diel phase difference between plant conductance and ozone concentration in assessing the potential for plant damage. In this paper, we use physical reasoning based on (i) plant defenses and (ii) general resistance concepts of dry deposition to derive a suggested general form of a dose-based standard. The dose-based standard is then related to the more traditional exposure-based standard. Although we develop the model in terms of plant injury, we also discuss how the model can be extended to include damage, which historically has been the focus of air quality standards. With this new dose-based approach, we clarify some of the issues concerning chambers and the interaction of the daily cycles of ozone concentration and plant stomatal conductance. We further demonstrate that ii) weighted fluxes can be used as a surrogate for plant defenses, (ii) injury or damage to vegetation is more likely to be correlated with a dose-based index that differentially weights ambient ozone concentration or plant uptake rates than one which does not, (iii) the potential for ozone injury or damage to plants can occur throughout the day, and (iv) when assessing the potential for plant damage, a differentially weighted flux-based standard is likely to be more precise and more discriminating than a cumulative ozone-based exposure index. Finally, because our basic premise relies on plant defensive mechanisms, we outline areas of research that are necessary before a dose-based standard can be implemented.

The effects of O(3) on other vertebrates have not been studied. Compared to individuals exposed to air (N=34), Bufo marinus toads exposed to O(3) (N=32) for 4 h lost 3.78 g body mass (adjusted mean from analysis of covariance, body mass mean+/-SD, 90.1+/-21.90 g).

Individual toad thermal preferences were also significantly repeatable across all trials (intraclass correlation=0.66, P <0.001).

The sensitive clone 5 and the more tolerant clone 2 were growing (1) under filtered air (=control), or (2) were exposed to 70 ppb ozone for 24 h (-1) (=profile 1), (3) to 100 ppb ozone for 12 h d (-1) at 8:00-20:00 (=profile 2), or (4) to 200 ppb ozone for 4.5 h d (-1) at 9:30-14:00 (=profile 3) for 20 d. The saplings were determined for growth, visible leaf injuries, stomatal conductance, and concentrations of Rubisco, chlorophyll and carotenoids. Growth responses and induction of visible foliar injuries under different ozone profiles were variable, resulting in 4-17% lower dry mass of shoot, 16>46% reduction in stem height increment and 11-43% increase in visible injuries in clone 5, which was accompanied by higher leaf turnover rate under profile 3 indicating compensation growth. In clone 2, ozone-induced responses ranged from slight stimulation in stem height growth to 13% decrease in dry mass of shoot and 2-16% increase in visible injuries. Daytime stomatal conductance rates were lowered by 14-54% in clone 5 and 9-74% in clone 2, depending on profile. The additional power-weighted analyses revealed that high peak concentrations and exposure shape were important for induction of visible injuries in both clones and reduction in stomatal conductance in clone 5, whereas growth reductions were rather related to total cumulative exposure.

Oak was the most responsive species to all three treatments; elevated CO2 and irrigation increased biomass by an average of 79% and 41%, respectively, whereas the ozone treatment resulted in a 30%, reduction in growth. Significant treatment interactions in this species demonstrated that CO2 ameliorated and irrigation exacerbated the effects of ozone. For Scots pine and ash, irrigation and elevated CO2 increased growth by approx. 60% and 20%, respectively, whereas ozone had no detectable effect on ash and resulted in a 15% reduction in growth of Scots pine. Carbon partitioning to the shoot was enhanced by both the CO2 and H2O treatments in oak, while branching was also increased in this species in response to elevated O3, resulting in changes to the allometric relationships. CO2 enhanced leaf production in oak and Scots pine, and together with the promotion of shoot allocation, this indicates an increased susceptibility to windthrow. Biomass accumulation expressed as relative growth rate, suggested three different time-dependent growth responses to elevated CO2; the CO2 fertilization effect was maintained through the third year of growth in oak, had disappeared in Scots pine and a negative effect was evident in ash. Foliar nitrogen and chlorophyll concentrations indicated a CO2-induced nitrogen deficiency in oak and ash, but not in Scots pine. Chlorophyll degradation in response to ozone was observed in oak, an effect that was enhanced by irrigation and reduced by CO2, presumably through stomatal mediated changes in effective ozone dose. These results therefore suggest that elevated atmospheric CO2 concentrations will enhance growth of some UK forest tree species, although this might only be apparent during the juvenile phase. However, nitrogen deficiencies might limit this enhancement on some sites while changes in allocation and leaf area might promote susceptibility to windthrow. Elevated CO2 also provides some protection against ozone pollution, especially in combination with limited soil moisture availability. These interactions between CO2, ozone and water supply should be taken into account when predicting the effects of environmental change on tree growth and forest productivity.",9.4.8.3,Physical Factors,0,0

Fluxes and deposition velocities of O3 were measured over a coniferous forest for a month. Mean deposition velocities of 0.35 to 0.48 cm/s for 03 and 0.6 to 0.72 cm/s for SO2 were observed during the growing seasons of 1997 and 1998. Weekly averages of O3 deposition velocity ranged from 0.25 cm/s at the beginning and end of the season to 1.25 cm/s in late June. SO2 had a smaller seasonal variation, from 0.75 to 1.5 cm/s between the beginning and peak of the season. Because 03 concentrations are higher, the flux of 03 to forests is considerably greater than the flux of SO2. Daytime deposition velocities are very similar at each site, from 0.75 to 0.79 cm/s for 03, and from 1.01 to 1.04 cm/s for SO2. Diurnal cycles for both gases are discussed, as are the impact of some weather events. The peak time for 03 deposition velocity is in midmorning, while it is near midday for SO2. Surface wetness is usually associated with a small increase in deposition velocity, but for some rain events a major increase was noted. Minimum deposition velocities usually occur at night and increase slowly in the predawn hours before light. Comparisons are made between observations of deposition velocity and predictions made with the Meyers multilayer deposition velocity model. While the model is, on average, unbiased for 03, it tends to underpredict the higher deposition velocity values. The model is slightly biased low (underpredicts) for 802 deposition velocity. The strengths of the model are noted, as are opportunities for improvement.",9.5.3.2,Diurnal and Seasonal Exposure,0,0

Resistance schemes used in modeling often perform quite well in daytime conditions over flat terrain. Model results for hilly or mountainous areas, however, are considerably less reliable than those for flat terrain. Even for homogeneous atmospheric and surface conditions and flat terrain, an inadequate model description of surface properties such as vegetative species and soil moisture stress can lead to large differences between modeled and measured fluxes. Third-generation models of mesoscale meteorology and atmospheric chemistry have the potential to achieve several advances, but scaling up of local to regional flux information remains a subject of research. Also, the integrated modeling of gaseous emissions and deposition, which need to be tied together at a low level of model structure, has not yet been accomplished. Many of the processes affecting dry deposition of O3 over individual types of surfaces are fairly well understood. The role of rapid in-air chemical reactions involving NO, NO2, and O3 are difficult to quantify comprehensively, and the effects of water from rain or dew on uptake of gases can be highly variable. The influence of lipid solubility on the uptake of organic substances is not well understood. For large bodies of water, the dry deposition rate of most gases appears to be determined largely by water solubility. Parameterizations for the deposition of fine particles tend to be empirical or based on theories untested in natural settings outdoors. Direct measurements of fluxes are required for improved parameterizations for gases and particles and have been made successfully in many past experiments. Micrometeorological approaches have been used extensively, but they are sometimes limited by chemical instrumentation. Long-term flux measurements for diverse terrain and relatively large areas remain difficult.",9.5.4,Ozone Uptake/Dose Modeling for Vegetation,0,0

Empirical equations were extracted from the ANN model with the best performance and these were analysed to determine their performance and to indicate the nature of microclimatic influences. Analysis indicated that combinations of VPD and the number of raindays were strong influences on the ozone dose-response and that temperature and the number of raindays had a secondary influence on the NC-S/NC-R biomass ratio irrespective of the ozone dose.

This paper investigates these interactions in an ozone-sensitive cultivar of clover (Trifolium subterraneum cv. Geraldton). Experiments were conducted using a glasshouse-based closed-chamber exposure system in which the plants were exposed for 7 h to either charcoal-filtered air (CF) or CF plus ozone at concentrations ranging from 40 to 160 ppb. The microclimatic conditions inside the chambers ranged from 16 to 36 degrees C, 0.9--3.6 kPa vapour pressure deficit (VPD), and 80-460 micromol m-2 s-1 Photosynthetically Active Radiation (PAR). Seven days after ozone exposure, the extent of foliar ozone injury was scored visually. The assessment scoring system was validated by pigment analysis. The data from these exposures were analysed using artificial neural networks (ANNs), the principles of which are described in the paper. Two ANNs were used, one to investigate the effects of microclimate on the threshold AOT40 (dose accumulated shove a threshold of 40 ppb) above which injury developed, the other to determine the extent of visible injury development. Both networks used temperature, VPD, PAR and AOT40 as inputs. Testing with previously unseen data showed that the networks produced accurate predictions of the threshold and extent of injury for a range of ozone doses and microclimatic conditions. For example, the injury score network predicted that at 100 Amol m-2 s-1 PAR and 1 kPa VPD an AOT40 of 350 ppb h was required to produce an injury score of 1, whereas in conditions of 400 micromol m-2 s-1 PAR and 3A5 kPa VPD, an AOT4O of 460 ppb h was required. Analysis of the weightings of components of the trained networks indicated that VPD and PAR had a stronger influence on the response to ozone than did temperature.

The great majority of published material on air pollution responses is of course on single species or agricultural bicultures such as grass/clover mixtures. Even for those studies in which multiple natural species have been involved, such as forest ecosystem damage caused by smelter emissions in North America (e.g., Gordon and Gorham 1963), the pollutant load has often been so high, and the damage so acute, that the results cannot be extended to chronic pollutant effects, let alone to their interactions with other stresses. Consequently, our deductions on biodiversity impacts are based primarily on the interpretation of environmental and physiological data from rather simple biological systems. Superimposed on this already complex situation of pollutant exposure we have a set of relatively new concerns brought about by increasing atmospheric carbon dioxide and UV-B radiation, and by possible changes in the distribution of global climate patterns that we have previously considered stable. If we remember, as background to this discussion, that around one-half of all known species inhabit tropical rain forests about which we have virtually no information on air pollution or its effects (Wilson 1988), then the sheer scale of the problem becomes apparent.",9.4.8.3,Physical Factors,0,0

Instantaneous ozone uptake rates were highest in high-light environments primarily because of higher stomatal conductances. Low ozone uptake rates of seedlings and saplings in the forest understory could be attributed partially to lower average ambient ozone concentrations compared to the canopy and open environments. Among the tree size and light combinations tested, ozone uptake rates were highest in open-grown seedlings and lowest in forest-grown seedlings. Despite lower ozone uptake rates of foliage in shaded environments, ozone uptake per net photosynthesis of foliage in shaded environments was significantly higher than that of foliage in sunlit environments because of weaker coupling between net photosynthesis and stomatal conductance in shaded environments. The potential for greater ozone injury in shaded environments as a result of greater ozone uptake per net photosynthesis is consistent with previous reports of greater ozone injury in shaded foliage than in sunlit foliage.",9.4.8.3,Physical Factors,0,0

Analysis of chamber results showed that the proportion of hosts parasitised and the searching efficiency of the parasitoids were both significantly reduced with O3 fumigation, but not with NO2 or SO2 fumigations. O3 fumigation reduced percentage parasitism by approximately 10%. Parasitoids were able to avoid patches with no hosts, both in filtered air controls and when exposed to pollutants. However in the O3 and NO2 treatments they appeared less able to discriminate between different host densities, suggesting that pollutants may interfere with the olfactory responses of the parasitoids. These results indicate the potential for air pollutants, particularly O3, to negatively influence the searching behaviour of parasitoids, and hence reduce the efficiency of natural enemy control of many pest species.",9.4.9.3,Indirect Effects on Wildlife,8.7.3,Plant Attraction of Natural Enemies of Herbivores

The physiological and physical processes that determine the magnitude of deposition, and the relative contributions of uptake by photosynthetic tissues versus ozone destruction on plant and soil surfaces, are not well understood. The California Ozone Deposition Experiment (CODE) demonstrated substantial deposition of ozone to several vegetated surfaces in the San Joaquin Valley. Using data collected during CODE, we examine the roles of stomatal conductance and leaf wetness from dew in mediating ozone deposition to an extensive field of irrigated cotton. Stomatal conductance, photon flux density, leaf area index (L), leaf wetness, ozone deposition, and canopy photon extinction coefficient (K) were measured. Single leaf measurements were scaled to canopy values of stomatal conductance to ozone (gc). Deposition velocity (Vd) and surface conductance (gsurf) were strongly positively correlated with gc. Under dry canopy conditions gc < gsurf indicating a significant residual conductance of a non-stomatal pathway for ozone deposition (gr), possibly reflecting reaction of O3 with nitric oxide emitted from fertilized soil. Dewfall reduced ozone deposition and eliminated gr. However, gr may actually have been increased by dew in amphistomatous cotton, as it was in hypostomatous grape during CODE. If so, canopy wetness reduced the stomatal pathway (gc) by occlusion of adaxial pores sufficiently to offset both the nitric oxide titration and the true wetness enhancement of gr. We conclude that ozone deposition to cotton is largely controlled by stomatal responses. Stomatal responses may readily be modelled, potentially providing sufficient information to infer ozone deposition. In contrast to the case for hypostomatous grape, ozone uptake (particularly by the stomatal pathway) is reduced by leaf surface wetness in amphistomatous cotton.

To examine biochemical and morphological factors that might regulate the long-term photosynthetic response of field-grown trees to elevated CO(2), we grew ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa Dougl. ex Laws.) trees in open-top chambers for six years in native soil at ambient CO(2) (35 Pa) and elevated CO(2) (70 Pa) at a site near Placerville, CA. Trees were well watered and exposed to natural light and ambient temperature. At the end of the sixth growing season at elevated CO(2), net photosynthesis was enhanced 53%, despite reductions in photosynthetic capacity. The positive net photosynthetic response to elevated CO(2) reflected greater relative increases in Rubisco sensitivity compared with the decreases resulting from biochemical adjustments. Analyses of net photosynthetic rate versus internal CO(2) partial pressure curves indicated that reductions in photosynthetic capacity in response to elevated CO(2) were the result of significant reductions in maximum photosynthetic rate (20%), Rubisco carboxylation capacity (36%), and electron transport capacity (21%). Decreased photosynthetic capacity was accompanied by reductions in various photosynthetic components, including total chlorophyll (24%), Rubisco protein content (38%), and mass-based leaf nitrogen concentration (14%). Net photosynthesis was unaffected by morphological adjustments because there was no change in leaf mass per unit area at elevated CO(2). An apparent positive response of photosynthetic adjustment in the elevated CO(2) treatment was the redistribution of N within the photosynthetic system to balance Rubisco carboxylation and electron transport capacities.

The small range of CH4 flux and OH abundance at the LGM is due to strong CH4?OH feedbacks. (2) Specific scenarios for CH4/CO/NO are selected to represent sources for the PIH and LGM. The CH4 budget is taken from an evaluation of wetlands and other natural sources. For CO and NO, apparent O3 levels and ice-core-derived H2O2 for the PIH are used to constrain PIH CO and NO fluxes. These fluxes are further scaled back to simulate the LGM, and perturbed temperature, precipitation and stratosphere-troposphere exchange are prescribed according to the GISS GCM. For the PIH changes for global abundance relative to present day are: 44% less O3; 20% more OH and 56% less H2O2. For the LGM, with 120 Tg CH4/yr and surface temperature 4?5 K lower than today, global changes are 56% less O3, 32% more OH and 59% less H2O2. Calculated preindustrial oxidant changes are in reasonable agreement with other studies based on one-, two- and three-dimensional models, although differences among model physics preclude a definitive comparison. There is consensus that OH has decreased since the Last Glacial Maximum, in contrast to projections for future OH, on which models are in disagreement. Model validation of oxidant concentrations requires more ice-core data. Preindustrial OH would be inferred best by using a model with ice-core measurements of species that are uncoupled from the CH4?CO?OH?O3 cycle. Candidates might be marine gases of moderately long lifetime, e.g., CH3Cl or OCS.",1.3.2.1,Climate Change in the Recent Past,0,0

Rising temperatures will increase the ratio of photorespiratory loss of carbon to photosynthetic gain, whilst rising Ca will have an opposing effect. The mechanism of these effects a the level of carboxylation in C3 photosynthesis are quantitatively well understood and provide a basis for models of the response of leaf and canopy carbon exchange to climate change. The principles of such a model are referred to here and used to quantitatively examine the implications of concurrent increase in temperature and Ca. Simulations of leaf photosynthesis show the increase, with elevation of Ca from 350 to 650 .mu.mol mol-1, in light saturated rates of CO2 uptake (Asat) and maximum quantum yields (.phi.) to rise with temperature. An increase in Ca from 350 to 650 .mu.mol mol-1 can increase Asat by 20% at 10.degree. C and by 105% at 35.degree. C, and can raise the temperature optimum of Asat by 5.degree. C. This pattern of change agrees closely with experimental data. At the canopy level, simulations also suggest a strong interaction of increased temperature and CO2 concentration. Predictions are compared with the findings of long-term field studies. The priniciples used here suggest that elevated Ca will alter both the magnitude of the response of leaf and canopy carbon gain to rising temperature, and sometimes, the direction of response. Finding question the value of models for predicting plant production in response to climate change which ignore the direct effects of rising Ca and the modifications that rising Ca imposes on the temperature response of net CO2 exchange.",9.4.8.4,Interactions with Other Pollutants,0,0

The plants were grown according to a standard protocol, and the forage was harvested every 28 days for 4-5 months per year by excision 7 cm above the soil surface. Biomass ratio (NC-S/NC-R) was related to the climatic and pollutant conditions at each site using multiple linear regression (MLR) and artificial neural networks (ANNs). Twenty-one input parameters [e.g. AOT40, 7-h mean O3 concentration, daylight vapour pressure deficit (VPD), daily maximum temperature] were considered individually and in combination with the aim of developing a model with high r2 and simple structure that could be used to predict biomass change in white clover. MLR models were generally more complex, and performed less well for unseen data than non-linear ANN models. The ANN model with the best performance had five inputs with an r2 value of 0.84 for the training data, and 0.71 for previously unseen data. Two inputs to the model described the O3 conditions (AOT40 and 24-h mean for O3), two described temperature (daylight mean and 24-h mean temperature), and the fifth input appeared to be differentiating between semi-urban and rural sites (NO concentration at 17:00). Neither VPD nor harvest interval was an important component of the model. The model predicted that a 5% reduction in biomass ratio was associated with AOT40s in the range 0.9-1.7 ppm.h (A11-1 h) accumulated over 28 days, with plants being most sensitive in conditions of low NOx, medium-range temperature, and high 24-h mean O3 concentration.",9.4.8.3,Physical Factors,0,0

At a given ambient O3 concentration, the rate of 03 uptake by needles was effectively controlled by stomatal conductance and, hence, by factors such as light, humidity and water status, which control stomatal conductance. At both study sites, atmospheric water vapor pressure deficit (VPD) was the climatic factor most closely correlated with ambient O3 concentration. Thus, when ambient O3 concentrations were highest, O3 flux into the needles tended to be restricted by narrowing of the stomata. Mitigation of potential O3 stress by stomatal closure was most marked at the low elevation site where both soil water stress and atmospheric VPD were greater than at the high elevation site. reduced (Komer and Mayr 1981), whereas trees at the timberline are rarely forced to restrict water loss (Tranquillini 1979). Mean O3 concentrations, however, are higher at high elevations than at low elevations (Miller et al. 1993, Smidt 1993). Because O3 injury results from biochemical and physiological processes occurring in the leaf interior (Tingey and Taylor 1982), these facts imply that high elevation forests are more vulnerable than low elevation forests to O3 induced damage. To examine this question further, we have compared total O3 uptake of larch growing at a high and a low elevation site to determine how O3 uptake is controlled by the stomata under field conditions.",9.4.5,Water Cycling,0,0

Exposure-response relationships were used to test the performance of different indices characterising the accumulated exposure. Potted plant mixtures were exposed in open-top chambers and cut repeatedly after four-week growth periods (GP). Yield data were related to O3 exposure expressed as AOT40 (accumulated exposure above 40 ppb during daylight hours) for the GP immediately preceding the harvest, or for all GPs combined. Data for relative clover yield showed that the effect determined after several GPs represented the combined effect of all preceding GPs, and significant correlations were found between clover yield and AOT40 calculated over all GPs. During GPs with low O3, clover recovered to some extent from injury produced during previous exposures to high O3. By comparing the effects of treatments with similar AOT40 values but different peak concentrations, i.e. a treatment with a more constant O3 exposure vs a treatment with episodic O3 stress, no difference in the effect on clover yield was found, but a stronger effect on total forage yield by the episodic treatment. The strength of the correlation between total yield and AOT increased with increasing threshold concentration suggesting that peak concentrations are more effective in eliciting the yield response than are lower concentrations. It is concluded that AOT40 calculated over all GPs is a suitable exposure index to describe the effect of O3 on the species composition of this type of mixture, but to describe the effect on total forage yield, peak concentrations of > 110 ppb must be emphasized by using an AOT with higher threshold concentrations.

This review is a critical assessment of the scientific basis of the concepts used to define critical levels for ozone and identifies the key limitations and uncertainties involved. The review focuses on the Level I critical level approach, which provides an environmental standard or threshold to minimise the effects of ozone on sensitive receptors, but does not seek to quantify the impacts of exceeding the critical level under field conditions. The concept of using the AOT (accumulated exposure over a threshold) to define long-term ozone exposure is demonstrated to be appropriate for several economically important species. The use of 40 ppb (giving the AOT40 index) as a threshold concentration gives a good linear fit to experimental data from open-top chambers for arable crops, but it is less certain that it provides the best fit to data for trees or semi-natural communities. Major uncertainties in defining critical level values relate to the choice of response parameter and species; the absence of data for many receptors, especially those of Mediterranean areas; and extrapolation to field conditions from relatively short-term open-top chamber experiments. The derivation of critical levels for long-lived organisms, such as forest trees, may require the use of modelling techniques based on physiological data from experimental studies. The exposure-response data which have been applied to derive critical levels should not be used to estimate the impacts of ozone over large areas, because of the uncertainties associated with extrapolation from the open-top chamber method, especially for forest trees, and because of spatial variation in atmospheric and environmental conditions, which may alter ozone uptake.",9.5.2,Description of Exposure Indices Available in the Literature,0,0

The quantification of such factors represents a step-forward in the derivation of Level II critical levels for ozone. The weighting factors presented are derived from published literature on the sensitivity of wheat (Triticum aestivum), bean (Phaseolus vulgaris) and plantain (Plantago major) to ozone at different growth stages. Weighting functions were calculated using either multiple linear regression or the reciprocal residual mean square (RMS-1). The resulting weights were transformed into multiplication factors to be applied to the monthly AOT40 during the 3-month assessment period of critical level exceedance. Interspecific differences were too large to allow for the development of a unified weighting function for the three species considered. For wheat grain yield, the derived multiplication factors varied by almost four-fold (0.40, 1.06, 1.54), while those for bean pod yield varied by only about 25% (0.85, 1.01, 1.14). The available data for plantain were restricted to short-term studies conducted under controlled conditions. These data were not suitable for the derivation of weighting factors comparable to those derived for bean and wheat. Based on known differences in wheat development and phenology across Europe, the need for a geographic differentiation of the time period for the calculation of the critical level exceedances is also discussed and examples provided of the adoption of the derived weightings in the mapping of critical level exceedances. Differences between critical level exceedance maps using weighted and unweighted AOT40 calculations are discussed. ",9.4.4.1,Yield,0,0

Plantago lanceolata were grown for 80 days and then treated with the ambient CO2 (as the control), gradual CO2 increase and step CO2 increase as well as low and high N additions for 70 days. While [CO2] were kept at constant 350 and 700 Amol mol-1 for the ambient and step CO2 treatments, respectively, [CO2] in the gradual CO2 treatment was raised by 5 Amol mol-1 day-1, beginning at 350 Amol mol-1 and reaching 700 Amol mol-1 by the end of experiment. The step CO2 treatment immediately resulted in an approximate 50% increase in leaf photosynthetic carbon fixation at both the low and high N additions, leading to a 20-24% decrease in leaf N concentration. The CO2-induced nitrogen stress, in return, resulted in partial photosynthetic downregulation since the third week at the low N level and the fourth week at the high N level after treatments. In comparison, the gradual CO2 treatment induced a gradual increase in photosynthetic carbon fixation, leading to less reduction in leaf N concentration. In comparison to the ambient CO2, both the gradual and step CO2 increases resulted in decreases in specific leaf area, leaf N concentration but an increase in plant biomass. Responses of plant shoot:root ratio to CO2 treatments varied with N supply. It decreased with low N supply and increased with high N supply under the gradual and step CO2 treatments relative to that under the ambient CO2.

The gas exchanges of current-year and 1-year-old shoots were measured, along with the nitrogen content of needles. In order to investigate the factors underlying modifications in photosynthesis, five parameters linked to photosynthetic performance and three to stomatal conductance were determined. Elevated O(3) concentrations led to a significant decline in the CO(2) compensation point (I*), maximum RuP(2)-saturated rate of carboxylation (V(cmax)),  maximum rate of electron transport (J(max)),  maximum stomatal conductance (g(smax)), and sensitivity of stomatal conductance to changes in leaf-to-air vapour pressure difference (""delta"" g(s)/ ""delta"" D(v)) in both shoot-age classes. However, the effect of elevated O(3) concentrations on the respiration rate in light (R(d)) was dependent on shoot age. Elevated CO(2) (700 Amol mol(-1)) significantly decreased J(max) and g(smax) but increased R(d) in 1-year-old shoots and the ""delta"" g(s)/ ""delta"" D(v)  in both shoot-age classes. The interactive effects of O(3) and CO(2) on some key parameters (e.g. V(cmax) and J(max)) were significant. This may be closely related to regulation of the maximum stomatal conductance and stomatal sensitivity induced by elevated CO(2). As a consequence, the injury induced by O(3) was reduced through decreased ozone uptake in 1-year-old shoots, but not in the current-year shoots. Compared to ambient O(3) concentration, reduced O(3) concentrations (charcoal-filtered air) did not lead to significant changes in any of the measured parameters.

This modeling study examines C sequestration (C(seq)) in natural ecosystems based on CO2 experiments. Most experiments are conducted by a step increase in CO2 concentration, whereas natural ecosystems are experiencing a gradual increase in atmospheric CO2 (Ca). To examine the effects of a step vs. gradual CO2 increase on ecosystem responses, we have developed a terrestrial C sequestration (TCS) model that focuses on C and nitrogen (N) interactions in regulating C(seq). We used the model to: (1) compare C(seq) and N demand in response to the step vs. gradual increase in CO2; (2) identify mechanisms underlying different ecosystem responses to the step vs. gradual CO2 forcing; (3) examine key parameters in controlling C(seq); and (4) explore three hypothesized N supply mechanisms in regulating photosynthetic acclimation and C(seq). Application of this model to simulate responses of a forest ecosystem with gross primary productivity of 1200 g C.m-2.yr-1 suggested that a step increase in CO2 from 350 to 700 ppm resulted in C(seq) of 263 g C.m-2.yr-1 in the first year. A gradual Ca increase led to the C(seq) rates of 27 and 58 g C.m-2.yr-1 in 1987 and 2085 when CO2 reached 350 and 700 ppm, respectively. The model predicted that N demand required to balance the additional C influx was 4.1 g N.m2.yr1 in the step CO2 increase and only 0.6 and 1.7 g N.m-2.yr-1 in 1987 and 2085, respectively, in the gradual Ca increase. The contrasting differences in C(seq) and N demand between the two increase scenarios reflected the nature of C fluxes that were controlled by the sizes of donor pools (i.e., donor-controlled system). Our modeling analysis of four ecosystems (forest with high productivity [HP]; grassland with HP; forest with low productivity [LP]; and grassland with LP) indicated that additional C influx and C relaxation time are the key parameters in determining ecosystem C(seq). The additional C influx varied with ecosystem productivity and N regulation, while C relaxation time differed between the forests and grasslands due to woody tissues and litter in the forests. We conclude that in spite of the fact that the step experiment is one of the most effective approaches in ecosystem studies, its results cannot be directly extrapolated to predict terrestrial C(seq) in natural ecosystems responding to a gradual Ca increase. In order to develop predictive understanding from the step experiments, we need not only to improve experimental design and measurement plans, but also to develop new approaches, such as deconvolution and inverse modeling, for data analysis and interpretation.",9.4.8.4,Interactions with Other Pollutants,0,0
35322,,,,Modification of plant response by environmental conditions,"Mills, G",2002,"The growth, development and reproductive potential of a plant are closely coupled to the environmental conditions in which it lives. Where one or more of the essential conditions for growth (light, water, nutrients etc.) are in short supply or in excess, the plant may exhibit a 'stress' response such as anthocyanin pigmentation of the leaves, reduced growth, or leaf and/or fruit abscission. Whether the plant is adversely affected by stress or healthy, the conditions in which it lives will influence both the uptake (flux) of a gaseous pollutant via the stomata and the ability of the plant to detoxify the pollutant and repair any damage it has induced. For example, some environmental conditions cause stomatal closure and effectively protect the plant against pollutant damage. whilst in other conditions, the closing mechanism of the guard cells is damaged, leading to increased pollutant uptake and consequent effect. By studying the modifying influence of the environment on plant responses to pollutants it becomes possible to predict how plants will respond in the cocktail of environmental conditions associated with the open field. Such information is of particular relevance for evaluation of the impacts of global climate change and for the modelling of pollutant effects across continents. To provide a comprehensive review of all of the literature on the effects of environmental conditions on the separate responses of trees, crops, natural vegetation and lower plants, to all of the major pollutants would require far more space than is available here. In the first part of this chapter the influences of the most important climatic and soil factors on the responses to the gaseous pollutants O3, NOx, NH3 and SO2 are discussed. For each factor, the pollutant and vegetation groups that are of greatest relevance are considered in the most detail. Later in the chapter, the ways in which multiple co-occurring factors influence responses to pollutants are examined using the increased sensitivity of plants to SO2 during the winter as an example.",9.4.8.3,Physical Factors,0,0

Sugar maple seedlings were fumigated with ambient, 1.7 x ambient and 3.0 x ambient ozone in open-top chambers for 3 years under low and high light (15 and 35% full sunlight, respectively). Three years of ozone fumigation reduced the total biomass of seedlings in the low- and high-light treatments by 64 and 41%, respectively, but had no effect on whole-plant biomass allocation. Ozone had no effect on net photosynthesis until late in the growing season, with low-light seedlings generally exhibiting more pronounced reductions in photosynthesis. The late-season reduction in photosynthesis was not due to impaired stomatal function, but was associated more with accelerated senescence or senescence-like injury. In contrast, the 3.0 x ambient ozone treatment immediately reduced diurnal starch accumulation in leaves by over 50% and increased partitioning of total non-structural carbohydrates into soluble sugars, suggesting that injury repair processes may be maintaining photosynthesis in late spring and early summer at the expense of storage carbon. The results in the present study indicate that changes in leaf-level photosynthesis may not accurately predict the growth response of sugar maple to ozone in different light environments. The larger reduction in seedling growth under low-light conditions suggests that seedlings in gap or closed-canopy environments are more susceptible to ozone than those in a clearing. Similarly, understanding the effects of tropospheric ozone on net carbon gain of a mature tree will require scaling of leaf-level responses to heterogeneous light environments, where some leaves may be more susceptible than others.",9.4.5,Water Cycling,0,0

Gas exchange was analysed, and concentrations of total soluble protein and ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase were measured as indicators of leaf senescence. Total antioxidant potential and ascorbate peroxidase and glutathione reductase activities also were determined. Black cherry and hybrid poplar exhibited O3-induced accelerated leaf senescence, whereas sugar maple and northern red oak did not. When the O3 effects were related to cumulative uptake of the gas, black cherry was the most sensitive of the four species. Although hybrid poplar exhibited similar symptoms of O3-induced accelerated senescence after the same exposure period as did black cherry, this species took up much greater quantities of O3 to achieve the same response. The O3-induced increase in glutathione reductase activity in hybrid poplar was consistent with the capacity of this species to take up high concentrations of the gas. Relative tolerance of northern red oak and sugar maple could be explained only in part by lower cumulative O3)> uptake and lower rate of uptake. Sugar maple had the highest antioxidant potential of all four species, which may have contributed to O3 tolerance of this species.

Three different types of exposure indices were tested: AOTc (accumulated exposure over a threshold mixing ratio for ozone of c nmol mol(-1)), CUO(t) (cumulative uptake of ozone, using an ozone uptake rate threshold of t nmol m-2 s-1) and mAOTc (flux modified AOT), which is essentially a combination of AOT and CUO. Ozone uptake was estimated using a Jarvis type multiplicative model for stomatal conductance. In terms of correlation between relative yield and ozone exposure, CUO(4) performed best for both crops. Also mAOT20 performed better than AOT40, which has so far been used for critical levels for ozone. The results supported the biological relevance of using a threshold below which ozone exposure is not to be considered harmful, since the relationships based on CUO(0) did not perform very well.

The method employs a parameterization based on one-dimensional radiative-convective equilibrium calculations; these calculations predict that the surface temperature should warm in response to both decreases in ozone above 30 km and increases in ozone below 30 km. The parameterization is used to investigate the response of surface temperature to observed changes in the vertical distribution of ozone at northern mid-latitudes. We show that the observed ozone trends, taken at face value, suggest a cooling of the surface temperature at northern mid-latitudes during the 1970s equal in magnitude to about half the warming predicted for CO2 for the same time period. However, the measurement uncertainty of the observed trends is large, with the best estimates for mid-latitude cooling being ?0.05 ? 0.05?C. The surface cooling is caused by ozone decreases in the lower stratosphere, which outweigh the warming effects of ozone increases in the troposphere. The results obtained differ from predictions based on one-dimensional photochemical model simulations of ozone trends for the 1970s, which suggest a warming of the surface temperature equal to ~20% of the warming contributed by CO2. Also, the ozone decreases observed in the lower stratosphere during the 1970s produce atmospheric cooling by several tenths of a degree in the 12- to 20-km altitude region over the northern mid-latitudes. This temperature decrease is larger than the cooling due to CO2 and thus may obscure the expected stratospheric CO2 greenhouse signature.",1.3.3.3,The Effect of Vertical Distribution on O3 Radiative Forcing,0,0

Calculated ozone uptake differed among open-grown seedlings, forest gap saplings, and canopy trees and between leaves in the upper and lower crown of saplings and canopy trees. On an instantaneous basis, seedling leaves had the greatest ozone uptake rates of all tree size classes due to greater stomatal conductance and higher concentrations of ozone in their local environment. A pattern of higher stomatal conductance of seedlings was consistent with higher incident photosynthetically-active radiation, stomatal density, and predawn xylem water potentials for seedlings relative to larger trees. However, seedlings displayed an indeterminate pattern of shoot growth, with the majority of their leaves produced after shoot growth had ceased for canopy and sapling trees. Full leaf expansion occurred by mid-June for sapling and canopy trees. Because many of their leaves were exposed to ozone for only part of the growing season, seedlings had a lower relative exposure over the course of the growing season, and subsequently lower cumulative uptake, of ozone than canopy trees and a level of uptake similar to upper canopy leaves of saplings. Visible injury symptoms were not always correlated with patterns in ozone uptake. Visible symptoms were more apparent on seedling leaves in concurrence with their high instantaneous uptake rates. However, visible injury was more prevalent on leaves in the lower versus upper crown of canopy trees and saplings, even though lower crown leaves had less ozone uptake. Lower crown leaves may be more sensitive to ozone per unit uptake than upper crown leaves because of their morphology. In addition, the lower net carbon uptake of lower crown leaves may limit repair and anti-oxidant defense processes.",9.5.4,Ozone Uptake/Dose Modeling for Vegetation,0,0

The assessment of the impact of O3 is facilitated by the use of a family of dose response models that covers the range of responses observed in field O3 dose response studies. The Weibull dose response model is a flexible, biologically realistic, model that has been found useful for this purpose. The purposes of this study are i) to discuss analyses of dose response data using the Weibull model and its extensions, ii) to identify some of the problems inherent in the use of a nonlinear dose response model, and iii) to show application of the model to two sets of experimental data. The basic Weibuil model is a modification of the Weibull probability distribution function. Extensions of the basic model allow for class variables and other continuous variables in the experimental design. A bivariate form of the Weibull allows for independent effects of two pollutants. The use of the Weibull model with class variables (cultivars) is demonstrated using a 1977 winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) experiment grown at Raleigh, NC involving four cultivars exposed to four levels of O3 pollution. Tests of homogeneity over cultivars of the proportional yield responses show differential cultivar response to O3. The bivariate Weibull model is demonstrated using a 1981 soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] experiment involving one cultivar exposed to the factorial set of treatments consisting of six levels of O3 and four levels of SO2 pollution. The test of lack of fit of the bivariate Weibuil model was nonsignificant, supporting the hypothesis that O3 and SO2 were acting independently.

To assess the factors controlling ozone deposition to the forest and to study the forest response, we established a research site in a ponderosa pine plantation similar to 75 km northeast of Sacramento. Ozone concentration and ozone flux, along with relevant environmental variables, were measured from June to September in 1997 and from May to November in 1998. Summer of 1997 had very low soil moisture and an early budbreak, while summer of 1998 had very high soil moisture and later budbreak. Soil moisture and vapor pressure deficit exerted a strong control on ozone deposition in the dry year (1997), but the relationship was less clear in the wet year (1998). During the dry year ozone concentration and flux became decoupled owing to stomatal closure, but this did not occur explicitly in 1998. Phenology also proved to be important in controlling ozone deposition. Early in summer 1997 cumulative ozone flux was 50% higher than that of 1998: the difference can be attributed to the late budbreak in 1998. Further, the highest ozone deposition velocity in both years occurred 3-4 weeks after budbreak. Total cumulative ozone flux during the summer was 6% lower in 1998 due mainly to later budbreak even though drought stress reduced ozone flux late in summer 1997.

An initial application of this model is illustrated for two species, wheat and beech. The model calculates ozone flux using European Monitoring and Evaluation Programme (EMEP) model ozone concentrations in combination with estimates of the atmospheric, boundary layer and stomatal resistances to ozone transfer. The model simulates the effect of phenology, irradiance, temperature, vapour pressure deficit and soil moisture deficit on stomatal conductance. These species-specific microclimatic parameters are derived from meteorological data provided by the Norwegian Meteorological Institute (DNMI), together with detailed land-use and soil type maps assembled at the Stockholm Environment Institute (SEI). Modelled fluxes are presented as mean monthly flux maps and compared with maps describing equivalent values of AOT40 (accumulated exposure over threshold of 40 ppb or nl l-1), highlighting the spatial differences between these two indices. In many cases high ozone fluxes were modelled in association with only moderate AOT40 values. The factors most important in limiting ozone uptake under the model assumptions were vapour pressure deficit (VPD), soil moisture deficit (for Mediterranean regions in particular) and phenology. The limiting effect of VPD on ozone uptake was especially apparent, since high VPDs resulting in stomatal closure tended to co-occur with high ozone concentrations.

The meteorological and gas concentration data were obtained with a 30 m high telescopic mast with 7 gas inlets located at 5 m intervals and meteorological sensors at 5, 15 and 30 m above ground; a complete gas profile was obtained every 9 min 20 s. Measured profiles were influenced by several exchange processes, namely evapotranspiration, dewfall, assimilation of CO(2) in the tree crowns, soil respiration, deposition of NO(2) and O(3) to the soil and advection of NO(x) from the nearby highway. Surprisingly, no decrease in O(3) concentration was observed in the crown layer during daytime, probably due to the relatively low density of foliage elements and strong turbulent mixing. The advantage of measuring in-canopy profiles is that turbulent exchange coefficients need not be estimated as a prerequisite to obtaining vertical flux estimates. In recent years, flux-gradient relationships in canopies have been subject to many criticisms. If fluxes are calculated at several heights considering only the transfers between the turbulent air and the interacting surfaces at a certain height, and those fluxes are then integrated vertically in a subsequent step, then exchange estimates (deposition or emission) can be obtained independent of turbulent exchange conditions. Typical estimated deposition velocities calculated for a 3-day period are between 4 and 10 mm/s for NO(2) and about 4-9 mm/s for O(3) (day and night values respectively). This leads to deposition rates of about 20-40 ng N/m(2)s for NO(2) and about 30-40 mg O(3)/m(2) deposited daily under the conditions encountered during HartX. Sensitivity tests done with the best available and most realistic values for model parametrization have shown that sensitivity is large with respect to the soil and cuticula resistances as well as for gas-phase ozone destruction and that more research is required to describe the effectiveness of cuticula and soil in modifying sink characteristics for NO(2) and O(3).",9.5.4,Ozone Uptake/Dose Modeling for Vegetation,0,0

Reductions in productivity of crops and trees as seedlings are greater when plants are exposed to higher daytime ozone (O3 ) concentrations (0800-2000 hr standard time) or for longer durations. Primary evidence on the greater role of concentration comes from exposure-response experiments where plants are exposed to a series of pollutant concentrations in open-top chambers under field conditions. These studies demonstrate that the integrated exposure indices that give preferential weight to higher concentrations are better predictors of response than mean or peak indices. Evidence suggesting that mid-range O3 concentrations (0.05-0.09 parts per million, ppm) play a greater role than higher concentrations (>0.09 ppm) in biological response could not be justified. The time of day when O3 concentrations and atmospheric and stomatal conductances of gas exchange are optimal is a key to understanding plant response because plants respond only to O3 entering the leaf via stomata. A turbulent transfer model that describes the resistance of pollutant gas exchange from the atmosphere to the boundary layer of a forest canopy, as a function of micrometeorological variables, is developed to determine when flux of O3 is optimal. Based on meteorological and ambient air quality monitoring data at remote forest sites in the United States, it appears that O3 flux densities to the forest boundary layer are optimal during the 0800-2000 hr window. It is concluded that descriptors of ambient air quality for use in setting a federal standard should (1) cumulate hourly O3 concentrations, (2) give preferential weight to day-time concentrations between 0800 and 2000 hr, and (3) give preferential weight to higher O3 concentrations.",9.5.3.2,Diurnal and Seasonal Exposure,8.13.2,Exposure Response

For assessing changes over time for O(3) exposure in the United States, we compared the 1-hour and two 8-hour metrics (2nd highest and 4th highest daily maximum values averaged over 3 years) for two periods (1980-1997 and 1988-1997). In addition, to explore changes in the distribution frequency of hourly average concentrations, we compared the 1-hour and 8-hour metrics with the W126 exposure index, a metric that is sensitive to the distribution of mid- and high-level hourly average concentrations. In many cases, different trending results were observed for a specific MSA or CMSA over the same period of time using the four different metrics. In general, we found that all parameters agreed for those areas that experienced highly significant decreases in O(3) (e.g., southern California, Chicago, and northeastern United States areas). However, when strong trending did not occur, considerable variation occurred among the metrics. The disagreement among the exposure metrics is probably associated with the fact that the 1- and 8-hour exposure metrics are extreme-value statistics. These exposure indices focus on the high end of the distribution curve of hourly and 8-hour values and are subject to meteorological variation. Because the EPA is interested in assessing the potential for O(3) to affect both human health and vegetation, it is questionable whether the use of an extreme-value statistic, such as the 1- or 8-hour standard, accurately measures the health risk inherent in exposure. It would appear that an exposure metric for trending purposes that most realistically reflects the distribution of the mid- and high-level hourly average concentrations that affect human health and vegetation may be more appropriate for assessing the protection of the public's health and welfare.",9.5.3.1,Role of Concentration,0,0

Overall, changes in production and carbon allocation were determined by the external O(3) dose rather than by the kind of O(3) exposure, indicating that, at the seasonal scale, the internal dose of ozone that was physiologically effective was a constant fraction of the external O(3) dose.

Of the metrics we assessed, SUM0 (the sum of all daytime ozone concentrations>0) best corresponded to ozone uptake by ponderosa pine, however the correlation was only strong at times when the stomata were unconstrained by site moisture conditions. In the early growing season (May and June), SUM0 was an adequate metric for forest ozone exposure. Later in the season, when stomatal conductance was limited by drought, SUM0 overestimated ozone uptake. A better metric for seasonally drought-stressed forests would be one that incorporates forest physiological activity, either through mechanistic modeling, by weighting ozone concentrations by stomatal conductance, or by weighting concentrations by site moisture conditions.",9.5.3.2,Diurnal and Seasonal Exposure,0,0

The importance of various physico-chemical characteristics (e.g. stomatal conductance, mesophyll cell wall thickness and tortuosity, chloroplast volume, apoplast pH, ASC:O(3) reaction stoichiometry) in mediating the flux of ozone to the plasmalemma is analysed. Model simulations, supported by experimental observations, suggest that the ASC concentration in the leaf apoplast is high enough to scavenge a significant proportion of the O(3) taken up into the leaf interior, under environmentally relevant conditions. However, there is considerable variation between taxa in the potential degree of protection afforded by apoplastic ASC, emphasizing the need for an improved understanding of the reaction chemistry of O(3) in the cell wall.",9.5.4,Ozone Uptake/Dose Modeling for Vegetation,0,0

Seasonal ozone dose to northern red oak and red maple in the upper crown of mature trees was approx. double that of respective understorey seedlings and saplings. Seasonal ozone dose to black cherry was up to six times greater in mature trees than in seedlings and saplings. The lower ozone dose to understorey trees was mainly a function of lower g(H(2)O), although canopy gradients in ozone concentration were indicated.

Exposures during vegetative stages caused little foliar injury and had only a small impact on total growth and yield. In contrast, exposures during pod development had a much greater effect on foliar injury, growth and yield.

A number of inferential modelling approaches have been developed, but the most up-to-date approaches use easily obtained meteorological measurements and information on the surface characteristics to estimate pollutant-specific deposition velocities (vd). These are then multiplied by air concentration measurements with hourly to weekly resolution. There are a number of sources of uncertainty associated with vd estimates, one of which arises from spatial heterogeneity in surface and meteorological conditions. Due to this spatial variability it is difficult to determine how representative a point estimate of vd is of other nearby locations (i.e. with 1 km) and whether a point estimate represents the prevailing conditions in the area of interest. This paper examines the uncertainty in vd due to small-scale spatial variability in meteorological variables by comparing vd and related parameters among up to four measurement locations all within 500 m of each other. These locations were selected to provide an estimate of the upper limit on the spatial variability in vd around typical air pollutant/dry deposition monitoring sites. Under most conditions (i.e. 75% of the time) the variability or uncertainty in a point measurement of hourly vd was within ? 40% for O3 and SO2 and ? 90% for SO2-4 and HNO3. Hourly estimates of aerodynamic resistance and friction velocity, which are needed to compute vd, varied spatially by an average of ? 115 and ? 41%, respectively. When vd was averaged over an annual period, the spatial variability was less pronounced. For SO2 and O3, the annual vd did not vary in space by more than ? 10% from the annual average value determined across all of the locations. For SO2-4 and HNO3, which are more dependent on meteorological and less on surface conditions, annual vd varied in space by about ? 30 and ? 40%, respectively.",9.5.4,Ozone Uptake/Dose Modeling for Vegetation,0,0

No attempt has been made to determine which exposure-response models best fit the data sets examined. Hourly mean O3 concentration data, based on two-three measurements per hour, were used to develop indices of exposure from soybean and winter wheat experiments conducted in open-top chambers at the Boyce Thompson Institute, Ithaca, New York NCLAN field site. The comparative efficacy of cumulative indices (i.e. number of occurrences equal to or above specific hourly mean concentrations, sum of all hourly mean concentrations equal to or above a selected level, and the weighted sum of all hourly mean concentrations) and means calculated over an experimental period to describe the relationship between exposure to O3 and reductions in the yield of agricultural crops was evaluated. None of the exposure indices consistently provided a best fit with the Weibull and linear models tested. The selection of the model appears to be important in determining the indices that best describe the relationship between exposure and response. The focus of selecting a model should be on fitting the data points as well as on adequately describing biological responses. The investigator should be careful to couple the model with data points derived from indices relevant to the length of exposure.

Polynomial regression analysis was used to relate each of 163 ozone statistics to crop yield. Performance of the various statistics was rated by comparing residual mean square (RMS) values. The analyses demonstrated that no single statistic was best for all crop species. Ozone statistics with a threshold level performed well for most crops, but optimum threshold level was dependent upon crop species and varied with the particular statistics calculated.

However, implementation of this approach requires the development of appropriate models which need to be rigorously tested against actual data collected under field conditions. This paper describes such an assessment of the stomatal component of the model described by Emberson et al. (2000. Modelling stomatal ozone flux across Europe. Environmental Pollution 110). Model predictions are compared with field measurements of both stomatal conductance (gs) and calculated ozone flux for shoots of mature Norway spruce (Picea abies) growing in the Tyrol Mountains in Austria. The model has been developed to calculate gs as a function of leaf phenology and four environmental variables: photosynthetic flux density (PFD), temperature, vapour pressure deficit (VPD) and soil moisture deficit (SMD). The model was run using climate data measured on site, although the SMD component was omitted since the necessary data were not available. The model parameterisation for Norway spruce had previously been collected from the scientific literature and therefore established independently from the measurement study. Overall, strong associations were found between model predictions and measured values of stomatal conductance to ozone (GO3) and calculated stomatal ozone flux (FO3). Average diurnal profiles of GO3 and FO3 showed good agreement between the field data and modelled values except during the morning period of 1990. The diurnal pattern of ozone flux was determined primarily by PFD and VPD, as there was little diurnal variation in ozone concentration.

Treatment effects on grain yield were unrelated to characterisations of ozone exposure obtained using either mean values or cumulative totals. Progressively better fits of the data were obtained, however, when cumulative totals were calculated above progressively increasing threshold concentrations. Good fits were obtained when indices which summed concentrations above thresholds of 50, 60 and 70 ppb were used.

We show that, in general, the climate response, specifically the global mean temperature change, is sensitive to the altitude, latitude, and nature of the forcing; that is, the response to a given forcing can vary by 50% or more depending upon characteristics of the forcing other than its magnitude measured in watts per square meter. The consistency of the response among different forcings is higher, within 20% or better, for most of the globally distributed forcings suspected of influencing global mean temperature in the past century, but exceptions occur for certain changes of ozone or absorbing aerosols, for which the climate response is less well behaved. In all cases the physical basis for the variations of the response can be understood. The principal mechanisms involve alterations of lapse rate and decrease (increase) of large-scale cloud cover in layers that are preferentially heated (cooled). Although the magnitude of these effects must be model-dependent, the existence and sense of the mechanisms appear to be reasonable. Overall, we reaffirm the value of the radiative forcing concept for predicting climate response and for comparative studies of different forcings; indeed, the present results can help improve the accuracy of such analyses and define error estimates. Our results also emphasize the need for measurements having the specificity and precision needed to define poorly known forcings such as absorbing aerosols and ozone change. Available data on aerosol single scatter albedo imply that anthropogenic aerosols cause less cooling than has commonly been assumed. However, negative forcing due to the net ozone change since 1979 appears to have counterbalanced 30-50% of the positive forcing due to the increase of well-mixed greenhouse gases in the same period.

Nonlinear functions such as the Weibull function have been used extensively to model the effect of ozone (O3) exposure on yield of several crop species. The usual nonlinear regression model, which assumes independent errors, is not appropriate for data from nested or split-plot designs in which there is more than one source of random variation. The nonlinear model with variance components combines a nonlinear model for the mean with additive random effects to describe the covariance structure. We propose an estimated generalized least squares (EGLS) method of estimating the parameters for this model. This method is demonstrated and compared with results from ordinary nonlinear least squares for data from the National Crop Loss Assessment Network (NCLAN) program regarding the effects of O3 on soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.]. In this example, all methods give similar point estimates of the parameters of the Weibull function. The advantage of estimated generalized least squares is that it produces proper estimates of the variances of the parameters, estimated yields, and relative yield losses, which take the covariance structure into account. Model selection, hypothesis testing, and construction of confidence intervals are also demonstrated. A computer program that fits the nonlinear model with variance components by the EGLS method is available from the authors.

Considerable information from field studies conducted in the past decade indicate that there is poor functional correspondence between agricultural production and the air quality index of the current secondary NAAQS for O3. Because the current O3 NAAQS is based on data for extreme values of air quality, the index (or form) of the NAAQS ignores key features of hourly exposure data that are desirable and important to minimizing the risk of crop damage. Previous analyses of existing vegetation effects data indicate that exposure indices that cumulated the hourly O3  concentrations over the season, as well as preferentially weighted the higher concentrations appear to have major advantages over the mean and peak indices on the basis of statistical fits to the data. The peak-weighted, cumulative indicators whose form and level are determined from crop studies were found useful in achieving a target production level that is higher than that of the current O3 NAAQS indicator with fewer violations.

The severity of injury was consistently greatest in treatment 2, followed by treatments 1 and 3, respectively. The interval between peak exposures was less important than the occurrence of peaks versus a stable maximum concentration. Premature leaf abscission occurred in the sensitive clone.

The lifetime of NOx varies from hours to days, giving large spatial variations in the levels of NOx. We have selected geographical regions representing different chemical and physical conditions, and chemical and radiative effects of reducing NOx emissions by 20% in each region are studied. Due to nonlinearities in the O3 chemistry as well as differences in convective activity, there are large geographical differences in the effect of NOx on O3 as well as variations in the annual profile of the changes. The effect of NOx emissions on methane is also found to depend on the localisation of the emissions. The calculated ozone and methane forcing are of similar magnitude but of opposite sign.

For surface ozone the regions of maximum growth are found to have shifted during the period. Up to 1950 the largest increase is found over central United States (+25-30 ppbv), while for the 1950-1970 period it occurs over southeastern Europe and northeastern Asia (+15-20 ppbv). For the last period (1970 to 1990) most of the growth is found over Asia (over the Persian Gulf, India, and northern China) reaching 15 to 20 ppbv.

Unlike previous studies, we use a combination of present-day satellite data, ozonsondes, and a chemistry model to produce a hybrid monthly mean ozone data set from 1870 to 1990. We calculate the radiative forcing due to the prescribed ozone distribution using a three-dimensional climate model that employs seasonally evolving fixed dynamical heating in the stratosphere. We find that tropospheric ozone causes a seasonal fixed dynamical radiative forcing (SEFDH) of 0.30 W m -2 over the time period 1870-1990. The spatial pattern of forcing is correlated strongly with the change in tropospheric ozone. When we allow for observed changes in stratospheric ozone we calculate that the forcing due to total ozone from 1870 to 1990 is 0.29 W m -2, with 0.18 from shortwave and 0.11 W m -2 from longwave processes. Thus reduction of stratospheric ozone since 1970 offsets the forcing by only -0.01 W m -2. We also consider to what extent increased tropospheric ozone offsets the direct forcing by sulfate aerosols.

We present a first application of the model to the calculation of radiative forcing from tropospheric ozone since preindustrial times. Longwave and shortwave radiation fluxes are computed every 5 hours in the GCM using the locally simulated ozone fields. In this manner, the model resolves synoptic-scale correlations between ozone and meteorological variables. A simulation for present-day conditions is compared to a preindustrial atmosphere ( similar to 1800 A.D.) with no fossil fuel combustion, 10% of present-day biomass burning, and 0.7 ppm methane. The two simulations use the same meteorological fields; the radiative forcing does not feed back into the GCM. The model reproduces well the observed distributions of ozone and its precursors in the present-day atmosphere. Increases in ozone since preindustrial times are 20-200% depending on region and season. The global mean, instantaneous radiative forcing from anthropogenic ozone is 0.44 W m(2) (0.35 longwave, 0.09 shortwave). The model reveals large shortwave forcings (0.3-0.7 W m(2) ) over polar regions in summer. The total forcing is greater than 1.0 W m(2) over large areas, including the Arctic, during Northern Hemisphere summer. The normalized radiative forcing per unit of added ozone column varies globally from -0.01 to 0.05 W m(2) . This variance can be explained in large part by the temperature difference between the surface and the tropopause; clouds are an additional factor, particularly at low latitudes. An off-line radiative calculation using the same ozone fields but averaged monthly shows nearly identical forcings, with differences less than plus or minus 2% over most of the Earth. The similarity between the off-line and on-line simulations suggests that the common use of off-line ozone fields is acceptable in radiative forcing calculations.

In particular, we focus on the vertical sensitivity by imposing the perturbations in different vertical layers. The simulations are done in perpetual-January mode and with climatological sea ice. The main part of the analysis is focused on global-mean values and in particular on the surface energy budget. Moderate sensitivities related to weak positive feedbacks are found when the perturbation is applied to the troposphere or the lower stratosphere, while larger sensitivities are found for perturbations in the higher stratosphere. This difference in the feedbacks is argued to be related to the vertical partitioning of the radiative forcing determined by the relative strengths of the long-wave and short-wave forcings. While the larger part of the short-wave forcing, which dominates for ozone perturbations in the higher stratosphere, penetrates to the surface, the long-wave forcing is predominantly deposited in the free troposphere. When the model is forced at the surface, latent-heat flux effectively transports energy to the free troposphere restoring the lapse rate to its unperturbed value. Conversely, when the forcing is located in the free troposphere transport to the surface is limited. For the experiments under consideration the radiative forcing and the climate sensitivity are found to be robust and only slightly sensitive to the definition of the tropopause.

Lightning is a major source of NOx, and thus of tropospheric O-3. It has recently been suggested that due to an apparent strong correlation between lightning strike rates and surface temperatures, tropospheric O-3 may significantly increase if the climate warms, resulting in a substantial positive climate forcing. This paper attempts to quantify the extent of this forcing and the associated positive climate feedback. Simulations incorporating a tropospheric O-3-surface temperature parameterization are performed of the last glacial maximum and of a climate in which greenhouse gas concentrations have been doubled. The O-3 parameterization is based on results from a two-dimensional chemical model. The simulations are obtained using a one-dimensional radiative-convective model, in which CO2, CH4, tropospheric O-3, and in the case of the paleoclimate simulation the surface albedo, are varied both independently and in combination. In the paleoclimate case, the tropospheric O-3 feedback has roughly two thirds of the effect on surface temperatures as the change in tropospheric O-3 due to industrialization alone. During climate warming, the effect on surface temperatures is about 60% of that due to a doubling of CH4.

Tropospheric O3 deserves par- ticular attention as both the primary constituent of smog [National Research Council (NRC), 1991] and a significant greenhouse gas [Prather et al., 2001]. Ozone is produced in the troposphere by photochemical oxidation of volatile organic compounds (VOC) and carbon monoxide (CO) in the presence of nitrogen oxides (NOx). While O3 production on global and regional scales is sensitive to NOx emissions from fossil fuel combustion [NRC, 1991; Wang and Jacob, 1998], reducing these emissions may increase greenhouse warming if the positive forcing from increased CH4 concentrations offsets the negative forcing from decreased O3 concentrations [Wild et a!., 2001].   [3] Methane is a known major source of the tropospheric O3 background, but is not generally considered a precursor to regional O3 pollution episodes in surface air because of its long lifetime (8-9 years). Recent recognition that intercontinental transport may contribute to these pollution episodes [Jacob et al., 1999; Yienger et al., 2000; Wild and Akimoto, 2001;  Fiore et al., 2002; Li et al., 2002] raises th profile of CH4. The present-day U.S. O3 standard is base upon a 0.08 ppmv (8-hour average), not to be exceed more than three times per year. If this standard become more stringent, as it is in European countries (55-65 ppbv) the relative contribution of the background component to exceedances of the standard will increase. We show that reductions in CH4 emissions deserve consideration as a means to meet air quality standards while simultaneously lessening radiative forcing.",1.3.4,Competing Effects of O3 Precursors on Climate,0,0

The vast majority of information regarding ozone effects on trees has come from experiments with seedlings, where controlled concentrations of ozone were administered in indoor or outdoor chambers for periods lasting from several days to one or more growing seasons. However, it is difficult to extrapolate, or scale, results from experiments on seedlings to larger forest trees. Mature trees typically differ from seedlings in morphological, phenological, and physiological characteristics that may profoundly influence response to ozone exposure. Also, it is possible that ozone exposure dynamics may differ for seedlings growing near the ground compared to exposure within the forest canopy. Complicating the ability to scale ozone responses from seedlings to canopy trees are differing interpretations of what is meant by ozone sensitivity. Differences in ozone sensitivity between mature trees and seedlings may occur because of differences in: ozone uptake (avoidance), compensation for injured tissues, internal properties that oppose the production of tissue injury (defense), and repair of tissue injury. Of these mechanisms, avoidance is commonly measured in scaling studies whereas compensation, defense, and repair are not. A review of studies that have compared stomatal conductance between trees of different size and age showed that large trees typically have lower stomatal conductance than seedlings, suggesting greater avoidance of ozone uptake by large trees, but there are notable exceptions to this apparent trend. For tree species where response to ozone and stomatal conductance has been compared between large and small trees, the tree size class with the greatest stomatal conductance showed the greatest detrimental leaf physiological response to ozone. This finding supports the hypothesis that differences in ozone response between different-sized trees of the same species occurs, at least in part, because of differences in ozone uptake. For most of these species (Picea rubens, Pinus ponderosa, Prunus serotina, Sequoiadendron giganteum), large or old trees had lower stomatal conductance and lower ozone foliar injury than small or young trees, whereas for Quercus rubra, large trees had greater stomatal conductance and greater ozone foliar injury than small trees. Drawing firm conclusions from published scaling studies is complicated by wide variation in study methodology and how `seedling' and `mature tree' are defined. To facilitate synthesis and improve prediction of ozone impacts on trees, we recommend that future ozone scaling research examine the occurrence and effectiveness of avoidance, compensation, defense, and repair in trees of different sizes with consistent methodology on a suite of species that vary in ecological and physiological characteristics. We also recommend that future research examine the possible consequences of these mechanisms to long-term ecological success for trees of different sizes in the presence of other biotic and abiotic stresses.",9.5.4,Ozone Uptake/Dose Modeling for Vegetation,0,0

To evaluate the potential for plant compensation, we followed the progression of ozone effects, with particular emphasis on the development of new roots. Ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa Dougl. ex Laws.) seedlings were exposed to ozone for 2 years. Following removal of the seedlings from ozone, root growth was assessed to characterize the carry-over effects on new root production, and carbohydrate concentrations were measured to determine if allocation strategies differed among ozone treatments. Four months after removal from ozone, dormant seedlings had significantly lower starch concentrations in stems, coarse roots and fine roots than control seedlings. Following root flushing, starch concentrations in all seedlings decreased, with ozone-treated seedlings containing significantly less starch, sucrose, fructose, glucose and total monosaccharides than control seedlings. There was some evidence that stem starch was mobilized to compensate partially for the lower concentrations of root starch in ozone-treated seedlings; however, there was significantly less new root production in seedlings previously exposed to ozone for 2 years than in control seedlings. Early senescence of older needle age classes, perhaps resulting in inadequate available photosynthate, may be responsible for the reduction in new root production during the year following exposure to ozone. Stored carbohydrate reserves, which were depleted in seedlings previously exposed to ozone, were insufficient to compensate for the ozone-induced reduction in canopy photosynthate. We conclude that there are carry-over effects of ozone exposure on ponderosa pine seedlings, including an enhanced potential for seedling susceptibility to other stresses even in respite years when ozone concentrations are low.",9.4.8.3,Physical Factors,0,0

We used the Aspen Free Air CO2 Enrichment (FACE) facility to investigate the impacts of elevated carbon dioxide (CO2) and ozone (O3) on the performance of the aphid Cepegillettea betulaefoliae Granovsky feeding on paper birch (Betula papyrifera Marsh.). In Year 1, we simultaneously measured individual performance and population growth rates, and in Year 2 we surveyed natural aphid, predator and parasitoid populations throughout the growing season. Aphid growth and development (relative growth rate (RGR), development time, adult weight, embryo number and the birth weight of newborn nymphs) were unaffected by CO2 and O3. Aphid fecundity decreased on trees grown at elevated CO2, O3 and CO2 + O3. Neither nymphal performance nor adult size were reliable indicators of future fecundity at elevated CO2 and/or O3. Aphid populations protected from natural enemies were unaffected by elevated CO2. but increased significantly at elevated O3. Individual fecundity in elevated CO2 and O3 atmospheres did not predict population growth rates, probably because of changes in the strength of intraspecific competition or the ability of the aphids to induce nutrient sinks. Natural aphid, predator and parasitoids populations (Year 2) showed few significant responses to CO2 and O3, although CO2 and O3 did affect the timing of aphid and natural enemy peak abundance. Elevated CO2 and O3 affected aphid and natural enemy populations independently: no CO2 x O3 interactions were observed.

In that context with a revision of the UN (United Nations)-ECE (Economic Commission for Europe) Gothenburg protocol, AOT40 values should be replaced by flux-oriented quantities, i.e. in the end by critical loads. At present, the database for the derivation of critical loads for O3 is extremely inadequate. Furthermore, the currently available flux-response relationships are also derived from open-top chamber experiments. The use of a relationship for spring wheat in a risk assessment for an agricultural site in Hesse, Germany, demonstrates in principle, the applicability of the critical load concept for O3. Comparisons of diurnal variation of stomatal uptake and AOT40 showed that a major part of toxicologically effective stomatal uptake occurred before noon whereas the AOT40 values were dominated by the O3 concentrations during afternoon. In other words, the AOT40 exposure index do not adequately address the O3 burden during hours when plants are sensitive to O3 uptake. However, due to the differences in radiation, air temperature and humidity between the chamber and the ambient microclimates, a derivation of flux-response relationships from chamber experiments is likely to be questionable, especially for species rich ecosystems: Here, without any changes in the pollution climate, significant modifications of species composition as well as an earlier beginning of the growing season has been previously observed. To overcome the problems associated with chamber-derived flux-response relationships, a new experimental and modelling concept, was developed. The approach, briefly described in this paper, combines methods in air pollution toxicology and micrometeorology. As an analogy to the free-air fumigation concept, O3 is released into the air by an injection system above the plant canopy. The assessment of dispersion and surface deposition of O3 released is based on Lagrangian trajectory modelling. Depending on wind direction and velocity, atmospheric stratification and surface roughness, without any disturbance of the microclimate and micrometeorology, several sub-areas can be identified around the source position with differing deposition rates above the ambient level. Taking into account the actual O3 background deposition, deposition rates and vegetation responses observed in these sub-areas can easily be used to derive fluxueffect relationships under ambient conditions and more realistic limiting values to protect our environment.",9.5.2,Description of Exposure Indices Available in the Literature,0,0

In xeric microsites, canopy response to O3 was characterized by higher chlorotic leaf mottling, shorter needles, lower needle chlorophyll concentration, and greater foliar antioxidant capacity.

In addition, ambient air plots (AA) were used. During the respective treatment periods in NF+pre and NF+post, the 12 h daytime (between 08:00 and 20:00 hours) long-term average of the ozone concentration was between 40 and 45 nl l-1. The ozone concentration was around 20u25 nl l-1 in the NF treatment, as well as in the NF+pre and NF+post treatments, during the NF+post and the NF+pre periods, respectively. The grain yield in NF+post was 11% lower than in NF and this difference was statistically significant. The difference in grain yield between the NF+pre treatment and the NF treatment was small (2%) and not statistically significant. Similar effects as for grain yield were obtained for straw yield and 1000-grain weight, with the harvest index and the water content of the grain at harvest being uninfluenced by the treatments. The protein content of the grain was 15% in the NF+post treatment, which was significantly higher than the contents in the NF treatment (13.7%) and in the NF+pre treatment (13.9%). The chlorophyll content of the flag leaves declined earlier in the NF+post treatment compared with the NF and NF+pre treatments. The difference in this parameter between NF+pre and NF was small.

Air pollution differentially affects the survival, growth, and reproduction of the species making up a plant community. These impacts influence the competitive relationships among the species. Our ability to predict successional changes and eventual steady-state communities under conditions of chronic oxidant air pollution has been limited by the relatively short period that ecologists have had to observe this phenomenon.

Consequently, conductance in O3-treated leaves was sometimes higher and sometimes lower than in comparable control leaves, depending on leaf age or level of photon fluence rate. For example, at low photon fluence rate or in the dark, conductance was greater in O3-treated than in control plants, while at high photon fluence rate that relationship was reversed. Exposure to O3 also reduced the water-use efficiency and range of leaf conductance of individual leaves, and altered the relationship between the conductances of the two leaf surfaces (the ratio of abaxial to adaxial leaf conductance was increased).

The model can simulate the total actinic flux (4Asr) in the UV-A region with an accuracy of 5% for all altitudes (0.1-12 kM) in the cloud free troposphere, while in the IJV-B the impact of the vertical distribution of ozone and aerosol can lead to differences, of about 5-10% at low altitudes up to 20% at higher altitudes.

It is shown that high levels of tropospheric ozone and absorbing aerosols can cause a decrease in the photolysis rates of ozone near the surface, even under conditions of reduced total ozone content. This fact indicates that tropospheric ozone can be disproportionately important as a filter against UV-B radiation when most scattering of the radiation by air molecules and dust occurs in the troposphere. This behavior is not simulated accurately using a radiative transfer model constrained by observations of ozone and aerosol optical depths.

Some familiar cumulative exposure-based indices include SUM06, AOT40, and W126. However, plant injury is more closely related to dose, or more appropriately to effective dose, than to exposure. This study develops and applies a simple model for estimating effective ozone dose that combines the plant canopy's rate of stomatal ozone uptake with the plant's defense to ozone uptake. Here the plant defense is explicitly parameterized as a function of gross photosynthesis and the model is applied using eddy covariance (ozone and CO2) flux data obtained at a vineyard site in the San Joaquin Valley during the California Ozone Deposition Experiment (CODE91). With the ultimate intention of applying these concepts using prognostic models and remotely sensed data, the pathways for ozone deposition are parameterized (as much as possible) in terms of canopy LAI and the surface friction velocity. Results indicate that (1) the daily maximum potential for plant injury (based on effective dose) tends to coincide with the daily peak in ozone mixing ratio (ppbV), (2) potentially there are some significant differences between ozone metrics based on dose (no plant defense) and effective dose, and (3) nocturnal conductance can contribute significantly to the potential for plant ozone injury.",9.5.4,Ozone Uptake/Dose Modeling for Vegetation,0,0

Emission factors account for changes in economical and technological developments in the past. The calculated emissions on a country basis have been interpolated onto a 10 x 10 grid. This consistent data set can be used in trend studies of tropospheric trace gases and in environmental assessments, for example, the analysis of historical contributions of regions and countries to environmental forcing like the enhanced greenhouse gas effect, acidification, and eutrofication.

Some of this energy is absorbed at the Earth?s surface or by the atmosphere, while some is reflected back to space. At the same time, the Earth and its atmosphere emit energy to space, resulting in an approximate balance between energy received and energy lost. Knowledge of the natural and anthropogenic processes that affect this energy balance is critical for understanding how Earth?s climate has changed in the past and will change in the future. In order to advance understanding of this issue, the U.S. Climate Change Science Program asked the National Academies to examine the current state of knowledge of how the energy balance regulating Earth?s climate is modified by ?forcings? including gases and aerosols, land use, and solar variability and to identify relevant research needs (see Appendix B for the full statement of task).

The fully coupled gas-aerosol unified GCM allows one to evaluate the extent to which global burdens, radiative forcing, and eventually climate feedbacks of ozone and aerosols are influenced by gas-aerosol chemical interactions. Estimated present-day global burdens of sea salt and mineral dust are 6.93 and 18.1 Tg with lifetimes of 0.4 and 3.9 days, respectively. The GCM is applied to estimate current top of atmosphere (TOA) and surface radiative forcing by tropospheric ozone and all natural and anthropogenic aerosol components. The global annual mean value of the radiative forcing by tropospheric ozone is estimated to be +0.53 W m-2 at TOA and +0.07 W m-2 at the Earth's surface. Global, annual average TOA and surface radiative forcing by all aerosols are estimated as -0.72 and -4.04 W m-2, respectively. While the predicted highest aerosol cooling and heating at TOA are -10 and +12 W m-2, respectively, surface forcing can reach values as high as -30 W m-2, mainly caused by the absorption by black carbon, mineral dust, and OC. We also estimate the effects of chemistry-aerosol coupling on forcing estimates based on currently available understanding of heterogeneous reactions on aerosols. Through altering the burdens of sulfate, nitrate, and ozone, heterogeneous reactions are predicted to change the global mean TOA forcing of aerosols by 17% and influence global mean TOA forcing of tropospheric ozone by 15%.",1.3.3.2,The Effect of Surface Albedo on O3 Radiative Forcing,9.1.1,Summary from the 213 Ozone ISA

Using a general circulation model, we have carried out a pair of equilibrium climate simulations with realistic present-day and preindustrial ozone distributions. We find that the instantaneous radiative forcing of 0.49 W m(-2) due to the increase in tropospheric ozone since preindustrial times results in an increase in global mean surface temperature of 0.28degreesC. The increase is nearly 0.4degreesC in the Northern Hemisphere and about 0.2degreesC in the Southern Hemisphere. The largest increases (&gt;0.8degreesC) are downwind of Europe and Asia and over the North American interior in summer. In the lower stratosphere, global mean temperatures decrease by about 0.2degreesC due to the diminished upward flux of radiation at 9.6 mum. The largest stratospheric cooling, up to 1.0degreesC, occurs over high northern latitudes in winter, with possibly important implications for the formation of polar stratospheric clouds. To identify the characteristics of climate forcing unique to tropospheric ozone, we have conducted two additional climate equilibrium simulations: one in which preindustrial tropospheric ozone concentrations were increased everywhere by 18 ppb, producing the same global radiative forcing as present-day ozone but without the heterogeneity; and one in which CO2 was decreased by 25 ppm relative to present day, with ozone at present-day values, to again produce the same global radiative forcing but with the spectral signature of CO2 rather than ozone. In the first simulation (uniform increase of ozone), the global mean surface temperature increases by 0.25degreesC, with an interhemispheric difference of only 0.03degreesC, as compared with nearly 0.2degreesC for the heterogeneous ozone increase. In the second simulation (equivalent CO2), the global mean surface temperature increases by 0.36degreesC, 30% higher than the increase from tropospheric ozone. The stronger surface warming from CO2 is in part because CO2 forcing (obscured by water vapor) is shifted relatively poleward where the positive ice-albedo feedback amplifies the climate response and in part because the magnitude of the CO2 forcing in the midtroposphere is double that of ozone. However, we find that CO2 is far less effective than tropospheric ozone in driving lower stratospheric cooling at high northern latitudes in winter.",1.3.2.1,Climate Change in the Recent Past,9.1.1,Summary from the 213 Ozone ISA

The GCM has improved resolution and physics in the boundary layer, improved resolution near the tropopause, and now contains a full representation of stratospheric dynamics. Simulations of present-day conditions show that this coupled chemistry-climate model is better able to reproduce observed tropospheric ozone, especially in the tropopause region, which is critical to climate forcing. Comparison with preindustrial simulations gives a global annual average radiative forcing due to tropospheric ozone increases of 0.30 W/m(Squared) with standard assumptions for preindustrial emissions. Locally, the forcing reaches more than 0.8 W/m(Squared) in parts of the northern subtropics during spring and summer, and is more than 0.6W/m(Squared) through nearly all the Northern subtropics and mid-latitudes during summer. An alternative preindustrial simulation with soil NOx emissions reduced by two-thirds and emissions of isoprene, paraffins and alkenes from vegetation increased by 50% gives a forcing of 0.33 W/m(Squared).

This research examined the effects of elevated CO2 and O-3 levels on host plant preferences and consumption of forest tent caterpillar (FTC, Malacosoma disstria Hbn.) larvae. Dual choice feeding assays were performed with foliage from birch (Betula papyrifera Marsh.) and aspen (Populus tremuloides Michx., genotypes 216 and 259). Trees were grown at the Aspen Free Air CO2 Enrichment (FACE) facility near Rhinelander, WI, USA, and had been exposed to ambient or elevated concentrations of CO2 and/or O-3. Levels of nutritional and secondary compounds were quantified through phytochemical analyses. The results showed that elevated O-3 levels increased FTC larval preferences for birch compared with aspen, whereas elevated CO2 levels had the opposite effect. In assays with the two aspen genotypes, addition of both CO2 and O-3 caused a shift in feeding preferences from genotype 259 to genotype 216. Consumption was unaffected by experimental treatments in assays comparing aspen and birch, but were increased for larvae given high O-3 foliage in the aspen genotype assays. Elevated levels of CO2 and O-3 altered tree phytochemistry, but did not explain shifts in feeding preferences. The results demonstrate that increased levels of CO2 and O-3 can alter insect host plant preferences both between and within tree species. Also, consequences of altered host quality (e.g., compensatory consumption) may be buffered by partial host shifts in situations when alternative plant species are available.

In a 2-year experiment, pot-grown soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr., Essex] was exposed from emergence to maturity to reciprocal treatments of elevated CO2 and O3 in open-top field chambers. Plants were treated with charcoal-filtered air (CF) (18 nmol O3 mol-1) or CF air plus O3 (72 nmol mol-1) in combination with ambient (369 'mu'mol mol-1) or elevated CO2 (718 'mu'mol mol-1). Whole-plant water loss was monitored by measuring mass changes of potted plants placed on electronic balances in each chamber. Plants on the balances were harvested weekly to determine leaf area, and were replaced with another plant previously exposed to similar treatment conditions. Seasonal average daily whole-plant water loss was lower by 17% and 28% in plants treated with elevated CO2 and O3, respectively, compared with the control. Water loss from plants treated with both elevated CO2 and O3 was 22% lower than the control.

Water use efficiency for seed production was increased 45% in the elevated CO2 treatments, but was not significantly affected by the O3 treatments. These results suggest that whole-plant water use was lowered by elevated CO2 because of decreased stomatal conductance despite 9% more leaf area. Decreased whole-plant water loss and seed production in the O3-ambient CO2 treatment was caused by suppressed growth and 28% less leaf area.

Chemical composition of petiole, stem, and pod husk residues was only marginally affected by the elevated gas treatments. Treatment effects on plant biomass production, however, influenced the content of chemical constituents on an areal basis. Elevated CO2 increased the mass per square meter of nonstructural carbohydrates, phenolics, N, cellulose, and lignin by 24?46%. Elevated O3 decreased the mass per square meter of these constituents by 30?48%, while elevated CO2 largely ameliorated the added O3 effect.

Mass loss of decomposing leaf residue from the added O3 and combined gas treatments was 48% less than the control treatment after 20 weeks, while differences in decomposition of petiole, stem, and husk residues among treatments were minor. Decreased decomposition of leaf residues was correlated with lower starch and higher lignin levels. However, leaf residues only comprised about 20% of the total residue biomass assayed so treatment effects on mass loss of total aboveground residues were relatively small.

We analyzed field CO2 response curves of 16 C3 species of different plant growth forms in favorable growth conditions in four free-air CO2 enrichment (FACE) experiments in a pine and deciduous forest, a grassland and a desert. Among species and across herb, tree and shrub growth forms there were significant enhancements in CO2 assimilation (A) by +40?5% in elevated pCa (49.5?57.1 Pa), although there were also significant reductions in photosynthetic capacity in elevated pCa in some species. Photosynthesis at a common pCa (Aa) was significantly reduced in five species growing under elevated pCa, while leaf carboxylation capacity (Vcmax) was significantly reduced by elevated pCa in seven species (change of ?19?3% among these species) across different growth forms and FACE sites. Adjustments in Vcmax with elevated pCa were associated with changes in leaf N among species, and occurred in species with the highest leaf N. Elevated pCa treatment did not affect the mass-based relationships between A or Vcmax and N, which differed among herbs, trees and shrubs. Thus, effects of elevated pCa on leaf C assimilation and carboxylation capacity occurred largely through changes in leaf N, rather than through elevated pCa effects on the relationships themselves. Maintenance of leaf carboxylation capacity among species in elevated pCa at these sites depends on maintenance of canopy N stocks, with leaf N depletion associated with photosynthetic capacity adjustments. Since CO2 responses can only be measured experimentally on a small number of species, understanding elevated CO2 effects on canopy Nm and Na will greatly contribute to an ability to model responses of leaf photosynthesis to atmospheric CO2 in different species and plant growth forms.",9.4.8.4,Interactions with Other Pollutants,0,0

We find that three data sets support an apparent long-term stratospheric ozone trend of -7.2 ? 2.3 DU during 1957-1975, which modeling attributes primarily to water vapor increases. The results suggest that stratospheric ozone depletion may have been roughly 50% more than is generally supposed. Similarly, three data sets support tropospheric ozone increases over polluted Northern Hemisphere continental regions of 8.2 ? 2.1 DU during this period, which are mutually consistent with the stratospheric trends. As with paleoclimate data, which is also based on indirect proxies and/or limited spatial coverage, these results must be interpreted with caution. However, they provide the most thorough estimates presently available of ozone changes prior to the coincident onset of satellite data and halogen dominated ozone changes. If these apparent trends were real, the radiative forcing by stratospheric ozone since the 1950s would then have been -0.15 ? 0.05 W/m2, and -0.2 W/m2 since the preindustrial.

We show that a global three-dimensional model of tropospheric chemistry with reduced NOx emissions from lightning (1?2 Tg N yr?1) and soils (2 Tg N yr?1) and increased emissions of biogenic hydrocarbons can better reproduce the nineteenth century observations. The resulting global mean radiative forcing from tropospheric ozone since preindustrial times is 0.72?0.80 W m?2, amounting to about half of the estimated CO2 forcing. Reduction in the preindustrial lightning source accounts for two thirds of the increase in the ozone forcing. Because there is near-total titration of OH by isoprene in the continental boundary layer of the preindustrial atmosphere, isoprene and other biogenic hydrocarbons represent significant ozone sinks. The weak or absent spring maximum in the nineteenth century observations of ozone is difficult to explain within our understanding of the natural ozone budget.

The experiments tested the impact of ozone, alone and in combination with low phosphorus supply and in combination with drought stress, respectively, on biomass accumulation. In this paper, the results from both experiments were combined for the first time in order to analyse the relationship between relative biomass accumulation and different exposure indices (accumulated exposure over a threshold (AOT) with different cut-off concentrations, and the sum of ozone concentrations above 60 nl l(-1), referred to as SUM06). In addition, a pooled analysis was made on several European studies of Norway spruce as a first effort to synthesize independent data and test the relative growth in relation to the AOT40 index. Significant negative relationships between the relative biomass of the GOSP-clone and the different indices were obtained. AOT20 and AOT30 resulted in the highest correlations. Based on the regression model, ozone is predicted to reduce the biomass of the GOSP-clone by 1% at the critical level for forest trees in Europe, a seasonal AOT40 of 10 mul l(-1) h. A significant negative relationship between relative growth and AOT40 was obtained also with the European data set. At the present ozone critical level, the model predicted a 6% reduction in growth for the most sensitive Norway spruce trees in this data set. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

Elevated streamwater NO-3 fluxes and high nitric oxide (NO) fluxes from soil, indicators of N saturation, have recently been reported for chaparral watersheds exposed to chronic N deposition in the San Gabriel Mountains north/northeast of Los Angeles. A number of nutritional and edaphic parameters across a deposition gradient in the San Bernardino Mountains (SBM) support the hypothesis that the mixed conifer forest in the western end of the range is also N saturated. Concentrations of NO-3 in the soil solution or in soil extracts during the summer months were 14 to 44 times higher at Camp Paivika (CP), a western high N deposition site, than at Camp Osceola (CAO) or Barton Flats (BF), eastern low-pollution sites. Accumulation of NO-3 in foliage of bracken fern (Pteridium aquilinum var. pubescens Underw.) and overstory species was also much greater at CP than at CAO and a site near BF. Nitric oxide fluxes in mid-August from relatively dry soil at CP were ca. 20 times higher than for typical forests in North America. Nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions, on the other hand, were low in the SBM sites. However, emissions of NO and N2O were several-fold higher at CP than at BF, a relatively low-pollution site. High NO emissions from otherwise undisturbed and well-drained forest soils of the western US may prove useful as a diagnostic indicator of N saturation. Nitrogen mineralization was greater at CP and Dogwood (high-pollution sites) than at CAO and Heartbar (low-pollution sites). Additional indicators of N enrichment at CP compared with the low N deposition sites include: low C:N ratios in soil and foliage, high foliar N:P ratios, higher nitrification rates and high soil acidity. Lower pH and base saturation were observed in soil from two high-pollution sites compared with two low-pollution sites. In summary, high NO emissions and elevated NO-3 concentrations in the soil solution and in foliage, and high foliar N:P ratios at CP, indicate N in excess of biotic demand, with potential above-normal loss of N from the ecosystem - and thus, a N-saturated condition. Model outputs from the nutrient cycling model (NuCM) agreed well with field data from the SBM on elevated soil solution NO-3 concentrations, reduced soil base saturation, and lack of a growth response to increasing N deposition.",9.5.3.1,Role of Concentration,0,0

Methane control is shown here to be viable for ozone management. Identified global abatement measures can reduce ~10% of anthropogenic methane emissions at a cost-savings, decreasing surface ozone by 0.4-0.7 ppb. Methane controls produce ozone reductions that are widespread globally and are realized gradually (~12 yr). In contrast, controls on nitrogen oxides (NOX) and nonmethane volatile organic compounds (NMVOCs) target high-ozone episodes in polluted regions and affect ozone rapidly but have a smaller climate benefit. A coarse estimate of the monetized global benefits of ozone reductions for agriculture, forestry, and human health (neglecting ozone mortality) justifies reducing ~17% of global anthropogenic methane emissions. If implemented, these controls would decrease ozone by ~1 ppb and radiative forcing by ~0.12 W m-2. We also find that climate-motivated methane reductions have air quality-related ancillary benefits comparable to those for CO2. Air quality planning should consider reducing methane emissions alongside NOX and NMVOCs, and because the benefits of methane controls are shared internationally, industrialized nations should consider emphasizing methane in the further development of climate change or ozone policies.",1.5.1,Summary of the Effects of Tropospheric O3 on Climate,0,0

Results from three 2030 emissions scenarios, broadly representing ?optimistic,? ?likely,? and ?pessimistic? options, are compared to a base year 2000 simulation. This base case realistically represents the current global distribution of tropospheric ozone. A further set of simulations considers the influence of climate change over the same time period by forcing the central emissions scenario with a surface warming of around 0.7K. The use of a large multimodel ensemble allows us to identify key areas of uncertainty and improves the robustness of the results. Ensemble mean changes in tropospheric ozone burden between 2000 and 2030 for the 3 scenarios range from a 5% decrease, through a 6% increase, to a 15% increase. The intermodel uncertainty (?1 standard deviation) associated with these values is about ?25%. Model outliers have no significant influence on the ensemble mean results. Combining ozone and methane changes, the three scenarios produce radiative forcings of ?50, 180, and 300 mW m?2, compared to a CO2 forcing over the same time period of 800?1100 mW m?2. These values indicate the importance of air pollution emissions in short- to medium-term climate forcing and the potential for stringent/lax control measures to improve/worsen future climate forcing. The model sensitivity of ozone to imposed climate change varies between models but modulates zonal mean mixing ratios by ?5 ppbv via a variety of feedback mechanisms, in particular those involving water vapor and stratosphere-troposphere exchange. This level of climate change also reduces the methane lifetime by around 4%. The ensemble mean year 2000 tropospheric ozone budget indicates chemical production, chemical destruction, dry deposition and stratospheric input fluxes of 5100, 4650, 1000, and 550 Tg(O3) yr?1, respectively. These values are significantly different to the mean budget documented by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Third Assessment Report (TAR). The mean ozone burden (340 Tg(O3)) is 10% larger than the IPCC TAR estimate, while the mean ozone lifetime (22 days) is 10% shorter. Results from individual models show a correlation between ozone burden and lifetime, and each model's ozone burden and lifetime respond in similar ways across the emissions scenarios. The response to climate change is much less consistent. Models show more variability in the tropics compared to midlatitudes. Some of the most uncertain areas of the models include treatments of deep tropical convection, including lightning NO x production; isoprene emissions from vegetation and isoprene's degradation chemistry; stratosphere-troposphere exchange; biomass burning; and water vapor concentrations.",1.3.6.1,Emissions of Anthropogenic O3 Precursors Across the 21st Century,0,0

In addition, Lagrangian model simulations indicate that changes in downward transport of ozone from the stratosphere into the troposphere were dominated by changes in lowermost stratospheric ozone concentrations rather than by variations of cross-tropopause air mass transport.

Elevation of [CO2] in FACE experiments reduced stomatal conductance by 22%, yet, this reduction was not associated with a similar change in stomatal density. Elevated [CO2] stimulated light-saturated photosynthesis (Asat) in C3 plants grown in FACE by an average of 31%. However, the magnitude of the increase in Asat varied with functional group and environment. Functional groups with ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (Rubisco)-limited photosynthesis at elevated [CO2] had greater potential for increases in Asat than those where photosynthesis became ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate (RubP)-limited at elevated [CO2]. Both nitrogen supply and sink capacity modulated the response of photosynthesis to elevated [CO2] through their impact on the acclimation of carboxylation capacity. Increased understanding of the molecular and biochemical mechanisms by which plants respond to elevated [CO2], and the feedback of environmental factors upon them, will improve our ability to predict ecosystem responses to rising [CO2] and increase our potential to adapt crops and managed ecosystems to future atmospheric [CO2].",9.4.8.4,Interactions with Other Pollutants,0,0

We examined how the dynamics of nutrient release from leaf litter responded to two important atmospheric changes: rising atmospheric CO2 and tropospheric O3. We evaluated the independent and combined effects of these gases on foliar litter nutrient dynamics in aspen (Populus tremuloides Michx) and birch (Betula papyrifera Marsh)/aspen communities at the Aspen FACE Project in Rhinelander, WI. Naturally senesced leaf litter was incubated in litter bags in the field for 735 days. Decomposing litter was sampled six times during incubation and was analyzed for carbon, and both macro (N, P, K, S, Ca, and Mg) and micro (Mn, B, Zn and Cu) nutrient concentrations. Elevated CO2 significantly decreased the initial litter concentrations of N (?10.7%) and B (?14.4%), and increased the concentrations of K (+23.7%) and P (+19.7%), with no change in the other elements. Elevated O3 significantly decreased the initial litter concentrations of P (?11.2%), S (?8.1%), Ca (?12.1%), and Zn (?19.5%), with no change in the other elements. Pairing concentration data with litterfall data, we estimated that elevated CO2 significantly increased the fluxes to soil of all nutrients: N (+12.5%), P (+61.0%), K (+67.1%), S (+28.0%), and Mg (+40.7%), Ca (+44.0%), Cu (+38.9%), Mn (+62.8%), and Zn (+33.1%).

The relative release rates of the nine elements during the incubation was: K???P???mass???Mg???B???Ca???S???N???Mn???Cu???Zn. Atmospheric changes had little effect on nutrient release rates, except for decreasing Ca and B release under elevated CO2 and decreasing N and Ca release under elevated O3.

An assessment on changes in the tropospheric oxidative state through a model intercomparison (""OxComp"") was conducted for the IPCC Third Assessment Report (IPCC-TAR). OxComp estimated tropospheric changes in ozone and other oxidants during the 21st century based on the ""SRES"" A2p emission scenario. In this study we analyze the results of 11 chemical transport models (CTMs) that participated in OxComp and use them as input for detailed radiative forcing calculations. We also address future ozone recovery in the lower stratosphere and its impact on radiative forcing by applying two models that calculate both tropospheric and stratospheric changes. The results of OxComp suggest an increase in global-mean tropospheric ozone between 11.4 and 20.5 DU for the 21st century, representing the model uncertainty range for the A2p scenario. As theA2p scenario constitutes the worst case proposed in IPCC-TAR we consider these results as an upper estimate. The radiative transfer model yields a positive radiative forcing ranging from 0.40 to 0.78 W m-2 on a global and annual average. The lower stratosphere contributes an additional 7.5-9.3 DU to the calculated increase in the ozone column, increasing radiative forcing by 0.15-0.17 W m-2. The modeled radiative forcing depends on the height distribution and geographical pattern of predicted ozone changes and shows a distinct seasonal variation. Despite the large variations between the 11 participating models, the calculated range for normalized radiative forcing is within 25%, indicating the ability to scale radiative forcing to global-mean ozone column change.

In three of the study years, plants were exposed to contrasting ozone levels in open-top chambers. Results showed that juice quality was more sensitive to ozone exposure than grape yield. Ozone-induced reductions in grape yield were best described by the level of ozone exposure in the 2 years prior to harvest, whereas sugar content of juice was mainly affected by current and previous year ozone exposure. Regression models were developed to facilitate quantitative assessments of the effects of ozone on yield and quality. The observed effects on grape yield and on carbohydrate accumulation in fruit were slightly better explained when a threshold of 6 nmol m-2 s-1 was applied to cumulative uptake of ozone (CUO6) compared with AOT40 exposure or other CUO thresholds. Curvilinear regression models were developed which explained up to 75% of variance of the datasets. These models indicate a critical level of 1.1 mmol m-2 ozone (CUO6 from June to September) to protect carbohydrate accumulation in fruit with ozone taken up by the plants over consecutive years. For grape yield the CUO6 threshold was 2.2 mmol m-2 ozone. Exceedance of this threshold would be expected to reduce grape yield and sugar translocation to fruit by 10% with substantial degree of uncertainty (95% confidence interval 1-19%). For individual years, the critical level could be increased to 2.3 mmol m-2 for carbohydrate accumulation and 3.5 mmol m-2 CUO6 for grape yield if the CUO6 of 0 in the subsequent year was not exceeded.

Our results demonstrate the importance of long-term studies to detect subtle effects of atmospheric change and of the need for studies of interacting stresses whose responses could not be predicted by studies of single factors. In biologically complex forest ecosystems, effects at one scale can be very different from those at another scale. For scaling purposes, then, linking process with canopy level models is essential if O3 impacts are to be accurately predicted.

Impacts of ozone (O-3) on C-4 plants have received little attention. Yet many important crops and weeds utilize the C-4 pathway, including yellow nutsedge (Cyperus esculentus L.). A previous study suggested that this species may respond to O-3 exposure with enhanced allocation of biomass below ground, including potentially to reproductive tubers, an apparent exception to the general weakening of belowground sink strength. This hypothesis was not supported by the current experiments, as exposure to 60 nL L-1 and 115 nL L-1 O-3 (12-h daylight mean O-3 concentration) reduced biomass allocation to tubers, relative to 4 nL L-1. Chlorophyll content, specific leaf weight, and carbon assimilation were reduced, while intercellular CO2 concentration increased, reducing water use efficiency. We conclude that (i) this C-4 species exhibits substantial sensitivity to ambient O-3; (ii) O-3-inhibition of allocation belowground is not limited to roots but also applies to tubers; and (iii) the O-3 component of global change will increase the competitiveness of nutsedge with respect to specific crops as shown previously, but will decrease tuber production and degrade water use efficiency of this challenging C-4 weed.",9.6.4,Summary,0,0

There is a growing evidence that ozone stomatal uptake may also take place at night and that the night-time uptake may be more damaging than diurnal uptake. Estimation of night-time uptake in the field is complicated because of instrumental difficulties. Eddy covariance technology is not always reliable because of the low turbulence at night. Leaf level porometry is defective at relative humidity above 70% which often takes place at night. Improved sap flow technology allows to estimate also slow flows that usually take place at night and hence may be, at present, the most trustworthy technology to measure night-time transpiration and hence to derive canopy stomatal conductance and ozone uptake at night. Based on micrometeorological data and the sap flow of three Mediterranean woody species, the night-time ozone uptake of these species was evaluated during a summer season as drought increased. Night-time ozone uptake was from 10% to 18% of the total daily uptake when plants were exposed to a weak drought, but increased up to 24% as the drought became more pronounced. The percentage increase is due to a stronger reduction of diurnal stomatal conductance than night-time stomatal conductance.",9.5.3.2,Diurnal and Seasonal Exposure,0,0

Plants grown under elevated CO2 conditions experience physiological changes, particularly in phytochemical content, that can influence their suitability as food for insects. Flavonoids are important plant defense compounds and antioxidants that can have a large effect on leaf palatability and herbivore longevity. In this study, flavonoid content was examined in foliage of soybean (Glycine max Linnaeus) grown under ambient and elevated levels of CO2 and subjected to damage by herbivores in three feeding guilds: leaf skeletonizer (Popillia japonica Newman), leaf chewer (Vanessa cardui Linnaeus), and phloem feeder (Aphis glycines Matsumura). Flavonoid content also was examined in foliage of soybean grown under ambient and elevated levels of O-3 and subjected to damage by the leaf skeletonizer P. japonica. The presence of the isoflavones genistein and daidzein and the flavonols quercetin and kaempferol was confirmed in all plants examined, as were their glycosides. All compounds significantly increased in concentration as the growing season progressed. Concentrations of quercetin glycosides were higher in plants grown under elevated levels of CO2. The majority of compounds in foliage were induced in response to leaf skeletonization damage but remained unchanged in response to non-skeletonizing feeding or phloem-feeding. Most compounds increased in concentration in plants grown under elevated levels of O-3. Insects feeding on G. max foliage growing under elevated levels of CO2 may derive additional antioxidant benefits from their host plants as a consequence of the change in ratios of flavonoid classes.

As such processes may differ among experimental plots there is a risk that effects of experimental treatments are confounded. Here we report on a free-air ozone-exposure experiment in permanent semi-natural grassland that suggested strong ozone effects on community productivity after 5 years. We tested ozone effects and investigated the potential of confounding due to changes in nutrient management. Repeated-measure ANOVA revealed mainly negative temporal trends for frequency of abundant productive plant species. Constrained ordination additionally showed converging trajectories of species compositions for ozone and control treatments with time. Yields sampled prior to the start of the experiment and soil nitrogen concentrations revealed that spatial heterogeneity in the soil nutrient status was not accounted for by the random allocation of treatments to plots with a bias towards less productive patches in the elevated-ozone plots. Re-analysis of yield data using repeated-measure ANOVA with a covariable to account for productivity prior to the start of fumigation revealed effects on the temporal changes in total yield and yield of legumes that cannot be separated between ozone and pre-treatment nutrient status. Changes in species composition favour an ecological interpretation with spatial heterogeneity as the major cause of different yield declines. Although elevated ozone may cause subtle physiological changes with longer term implications, our new results suggest that species-rich mature grassland such as the one studied at Le Mouret may be less sensitive to elevated ozone than previously assumed.

Assessing O3 damage to crops is challenging due to the difficulties in determining the reduction in crop yield that results from exposure to surface O3, for which monitors are limited and mostly deployed in non-rural areas. This work explores the potential benefits of using operational air quality forecast (AQF) data to estimate rural O3 exposure.

Research with the O3 concentration parameter led to the recognition that both peak concentrations and cumulative effects are important when relating plant response to O3. The US and Canada currently use O3 concentration-based (exposure-based) parameters for ambient air quality standards for protecting vegetation; the European countries use exposure-based critical levels to relate O3 to vegetation response. Because plant response is thought to be more closely related to O3 absorbed into leaf tissue, recent research has been focused on flux-based O3 parameters. Even though flux-based indices may appear to be more biologically relevant than concentration-based indices, there are limitations associated with their use. The current set of flux-based indices assumes that the plant has no defense mechanism to detoxify O3. This is a serious limitation. In this paper, we review the literature on exposure- and flux-based indices for predicting plant response. Both exposure- and flux-based metrics may overestimate plant response. At this time, flux-based models that take into consideration detoxification mechanisms (referred to as effective flux) provide the best approach to relate O3 to plant response. However, because there is considerable uncertainty in quantifying the various defense mechanisms, effective flux at this time is difficult to quantify. Without adequate effective-flux based models, exposure-based O3 metrics appear to be the only practical measure for use in relating ambient air quality standards to vegetation response.",9.5.3.2,Diurnal and Seasonal Exposure,0,0

projected increases in O3 concentrations in the region, East Asian countries are presently on the cusp of substantial
reductions in grain production. Our conservative estimates, based on 7- and 12-h mean (M7 or M12) exposure indices,
show that due to O3 concentrations in 1990 China, Japan and South Korea lost 1?9% of their yield of wheat, rice and
corn and 23?27% of their yield of soybeans, with an associated value of 1990US$ 3.5, 1.2 and 0.24 billion, respectively.
In 2020, assuming no change in agricultural production practices and again using M7 and M12 exposure indices, grain
loss due to increased levels of O3 pollution is projected to increase to 2?16% for wheat, rice and corn and 28?35% for
soybeans; the associated economic costs are expected to increase by 82%, 33%, and 67% in 2020 over 1990 for China,
Japan and South Korea, respectively. For most crops, the yield losses in 1990 based on SUM06 or W126 exposure
indices are lower than yield losses estimated using M7 or M12 exposure indices in China and Japan but higher in South
Korea; in 2020, the yield losses based on SUM06 or W126 exposure indices are substantially higher for all crops in all
three countries. This is primarily due to the nature of the cumulative indices which weight elevated values of O3 more
heavily than lower values. Chinese compliance with its ambient O3 standard in 1990 would have had a limited effect in
reducing the grain yield loss caused by O3 exposure, resulting in only US$ 0.2 billion of additional grain revenues, but in
2020 compliance could reduce the yield loss by one third and lead to an increase of US$ 2.6 (M7 or M12) ?27 (SUM06)

has been the basis of the level I approach to determine
and predict ozone damage to vegetation (Fuhrer et al.,

In the attempt to improve ozone dose/effect predictions,
a more mechanistic approach has been recently

The 2000-2050 climate change increases the tropospheric ozone burden by 1.6%, due mostly to lightning in the upper troposphere, and also increases global tropospheric OH by 12%. In the lower troposphere, by contrast, climate change generally decreases the background ozone. The 2000-2050 increase in global anthropogenic emissions of ozone precursors increases PRB ozone by 2-6 ppb in summer; the maximum effect is found in April (3-7 ppb). The summertime PRB ozone decreases by up to 2 ppb with 2000-2050 climate change, except over the Great Plains, where it increases slightly as a result of increasing soil NO x emission. Climate change cancels out the effect of rising global anthropogenic emissions on the summertime PRB ozone in the eastern United States, but there is still a 2-5 ppb increase in the west.",1.3.6.2,Impact of 21st Century Trends in Emissions on Tropospheric O3 Concentrations,0,0

The models used mid-range A1B emission scenarios, independently calculated the resulting composition change, and then performed transient simulations to 2050 examining the response to projected changes in short-lived species and to changes in both long-lived and short-lived species together. By 2050, two models show that the global mean annual average warming due to long-lived GHGs (greenhouse gases) is enhanced by 20?25% due to the radiatively active short-lived species. One model shows virtually no effect from short-lived species. Intermodel differences are largely related to differences in emissions projections for short-lived species, which are substantial even for a particular storyline. For aerosols, these uncertainties are usually dominant, though for sulfate uncertainties in aerosol physics are also substantial. For tropospheric ozone, uncertainties in physical processes are more important than uncertainties in precursor emissions. Differences in future atmospheric burdens and radiative forcing for aerosols are dominated by divergent assumptions about emissions from South and East Asia. In all three models, the spatial distribution of radiative forcing is less important than that of climate sensitivity in predicting climate impact. Both short-lived and long-lived species appear to cause enhanced climate responses in the same regions of high sensitivity rather than short-lived species having an enhanced effect primarily near polluted areas. Since short-lived species can significantly influence climate, regional air quality emission control strategies for short-lived pollutants may substantially impact climate over large (e.g., hemispheric) scales.

The forecasts build on a recent 1996 inventory of emissions that contains detailed fuel, technology, sector, and world-region specifications. The forecasts are driven by four IPCC scenarios, A1B, A2, B1, and B2, out to 2030 and 2050, incorporating not only changing patterns of fuel use but also technology development. Emissions from both energy generation and open biomass burning are included. We project that global BC emissions will decline from 8.0 Tg in 1996 to 5.3?7.3 Tg by 2030 and to 4.3?6.1 Tg by 2050, across the range of scenarios. We project that OC emissions will decline from 34 Tg in 1996 to 24?30 Tg by 2030 and to 21?28 Tg by 2050. The introduction of advanced technology with lower emission rates, as well as a shift away from the use of traditional solid fuels in the residential sector, more than offsets the increased combustion of fossil fuels worldwide. Environmental pressures and a diminishing demand for new agricultural land lead to a slow decline in the amount of open biomass burning. Although emissions of BC and OC are generally expected to decline around the world, some regions, particularly South America, northern Africa, the Middle East, South Asia, Southeast Asia, and Oceania, show increasing emissions in several scenarios. Particularly difficult to control are BC emissions from the transport sector, which increase under most scenarios. We expect that the BC/OC emission ratio for energy sources will rise from 0.5 to as much as 0.8, signifying a shift toward net warming of the climate system due to carbonaceous aerosols. When biomass burning is included, however, the BC/OC emission ratios are for the most part invariant across scenarios at about 0.2.",1.3.6.1,Emissions of Anthropogenic O3 Precursors Across the 21st Century,0,0

We find a substantial range in the 'efficacy' of different forcings, where the efficacy is the global temperature response per unit forcing relative to the response to CO sub(2) forcing. Anthropogenic CH sub(4) has efficacy similar to 110%, which increases to similar to 145% when its indirect effects on stratospheric H sub(2)O and tropospheric O sub(3) are included, yielding an effective climate forcing of similar to 0.8 W/m super(2) for the period 1750-2000 and making CH sub(4) the largest anthropogenic climate forcing other than CO sub(2). Black carbon (BC) aerosols from biomass burning have a calculated efficacy similar to 58%, while fossil fuel BC has an efficacy similar to 78%. Accounting for forcing efficacies and for indirect effects via snow albedo and cloud changes, we find that fossil fuel soot, defined as BC + OC (organic carbon), has a net positive forcing while biomass burning BC + OC has a negative forcing. We show that replacement of the traditional instantaneous and adjusted forcings, Fi and Fa, with an easily computed alternative, Fs, yields a better predictor of climate change, i.e., its efficacies are closer to unity. Fs is inferred from flux and temperature changes in a fixed-ocean model run. There is remarkable congruence in the spatial distribution of climate change, normalized to the same forcing Fs, for most climate forcing agents, suggesting that the global forcing has more relevance to regional climate change than may have been anticipated. Increasing greenhouse gases intensify the Hadley circulation in our model, increasing rainfall in the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ), Eastern United States, and East Asia, while intensifying dry conditions in the subtropics including the Southwest United States, the Mediterranean region, the Middle East, and an expanding Sahel. These features survive in model simulations that use all estimated forcings for the period 1880-2000. Responses to localized forcings, such as land use change and heavy regional concentrations of BC aerosols, include more specific regional characteristics. We suggest that anthropogenic tropospheric O sub(3) and the BC snow albedo effect contribute substantially to rapid warming and sea ice loss in the Arctic. As a complement to a priori forcings, such as Fi, Fa, and Fs, we tabulate the a posteriori effective forcing, Fe, which is the product of the forcing and its efficacy. Fe requires calculation of the climate response and introduces greater model dependence, but once it is calculated for a given amount of a forcing agent it provides a good prediction of the response to other forcing amounts.

Response patterns are characterized using empirical orthogonal functions (EOFs) and the quasi-EOFs of Harvey and Wigley (the first qEOF field, discussed here, is given by the correlation between local year-by-year temperature changes and the global mean temperature change). The first temperature EOF accounts for 80-95% of the space-time variation of the CO2 run in all of the models, and is almost identical to qEOF1 of the temperature response or to the temperature change pattern averaged over the last 30 years of the simulations. EOF1 accounts for 80-95% of the space-time variation in the CO2+ aerosol runs in six of the eight models. The CO2 response patterns of different models are highly correlated with one another (R2 generally > 0.5), and are also highly correlated with the CO2 + aerosol response patterns (R2? 0.85 in all except one model). The difference between CO2 and CO2 + aerosol runs can be represented by EOF1 of the year-by-year differences, by qEOF1 of the year-by-year differences, or by the difference in temperature averaged over the last 30 years of each run. In models where these representations are highly correlated with each other, they are also highly correlated with CO2 EOF1. In other cases, aerosol EOF1 is modestly to highly correlated with control EOF1 (i.e.: the year-by-year differences between CO2 and CO2 + aerosol runs are dominated by internal variability), while aerosol qEOF1 and the 30-year difference are highly correlated with each other. For all models, the decadal mean temperature change can be closely replicated by scaling the CO2 EOF1 pattern based on the global mean temperature changes (RMSE for the last decade is < 6% of the RMS temperature change for CO2 runs, < 8% for CO2 + aerosol runs). The first EOF of the precipitation response to increasing CO2 accounts for only 10-30% of the space-time variation, and is generally highly correlated (R2 up to 0.85) with control EOF1. In all of the models, there is an increase in precipitation in the ITCZ and a decrease in bands at or near 30?S and 30?N. In many models there is an El Ni?o-like response, including a substantial decrease in precipitation over the Amazon. Global-mean precipitation increases in all models due to CO2 forcing, but aerosols appear to have a disproportionally large effect in suppressing the increase compared to their effect in suppressing the warming. There is evidence in some models that the non-absorbing aerosols considered here reduce summer monsoon rainfall compared to the changes that would be expected based on the globally averaged effect of aerosols on precipitation. When regional precipitation changes over time are predicted by scaling a fixed precipitation-change pattern with the global mean temperature change, the global mean RMSE in the predicted change in decadal-mean precipitation is 25-35% of the global RMS precipitation changes by the end of the simulation.",1.3.3.4,Feedback Factors that Alter the Climate Response to Changes in O3 Radiative Forcing,0,0

As abiotic factors rapidly change habitat suitability, projections range from altered genetic diversity to wide-spread species loss. Here, we assess the degree to which changes in atmospheric composition associated with environmental change will influence not only the abundance, but also the genotypic/phenotypic diversity, of herbivore populations. Using free-air CO2 and O-3 enrichment (FACE) technology, we assess numerical responses of pea aphids (Acyrthosiphon pisum) exhibiting a pink-green genetic polymorphism and an environmentally determined wing polyphenism on broad bean plants (Vicia faba) under enriched CO2 and/or O-3 atmospheres, over multiple generations. We show that these two greenhouse gases alter not only aphid population sizes, but also genotypic and phenotypic frequencies. As the green genotype was positively influenced by elevated CO2 levels, but the pink genotype was not, genotypic frequencies (pink morph : green morph) ranged from 1 : 1 to 9 : 1. These two genotypes also displayed marked differences in phenotypic frequencies. The pink genotype exhibited higher levels of wing induction under all atmospheric treatments, however, this polyphenism was negatively influenced by elevated O-3 levels. Resultantly, frequencies of winged phenotypes (pink morph : green morph) varied from 10 : 1 to 332 : 1.

Soybean plants were subjected to well-watered and water-stress conditions, and three levels of ozone (zero, low and high) in open top chambers (OTC) during the,growing seasons. The paper has four objectives: (i) to reproduce in OTCs the ozone concentrations actually observed in the field; (ii) to analyze the effect of ozone on well-watered crops by comparing a ""control"" (OTC ozone filtered treatment) with two ozone levels (at the end of the soybean growing seasons accumulated AOT40 values were 3400 and 9000 ppb h for low and high ozone treatments, respectively); observations were carried out both at leaf scale (stomatal conductance) and at canopy scale (determination of daily evapotranspiration, AET); (iii) to take into consideration the effect of drought, where the leaf and canopy scale observations were also implemented on water-stressed crops; and (iv) to analyze and verify the reliability of the ozone exposure-plant response relationship. In well-watered conditions, an increase in ozone concentration levels reduced stomatal conductance and AET. Reductions in AET were 14% and 28% at low and high ozone levels, respectively, as compared to the control treatment. Hence, the results of daily AET were consistent with stomatal conductance results. In water stress conditions, on the contrary, an increase in ozone had no effect on stomatal conductance and AET. During the 3-year study, significant relationships were found between AOT40 and relative (low or high to control ozone treatment) values of stomatal conductance and AET in well-watered conditions. The reliability observed for these relationships suggest that they will be useful in soybean growth and yield-prediction models. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",9.4.4.3,Summary,0,0

In well-watered conditions, ail increase in ozone concentration led to a reduction in leaf area, dry matter and reproductive organs. Whereas, ail increase in ozone had no effect oil plants in water-stressed conditions. At a high level of ozone concentration, there was a 47% reduction in yield and a 25% reduction in WUE ill comparison with the control treatment. The reduction in yield was due to a lower number of pods per plant and 1000-grain weight. Despite changes in the grain yield, the yield quality was not altered by ozone. During the 3-year study, AOT40 was significantly correlated with the leaf area and the final above-ground dry matter. The latter was less sensitive to ozone than leaf area.

To test this prediction, we measured levels of herbivory in soybean grown in ambient air and air enriched with CO2 or O-3 using free air gas concentration enrichment (FACE). Under open-air conditions and exposure to the full insect community, elevated [CO2] increased the susceptibility of soybeans to herbivory early in the season, whereas exposure to elevated [O-3] seemed to have no effect. In the region of the canopy exposed to high levels of herbivory, the percentage of leaf area removed increased from 5 to > 11% at elevated [CO2]. We found no evidence for compensatory feeding at elevated [CO,] where leaf nitrogen content and C:N ratio were unaltered in plants experiencing increased herbivory. However, levels of leaf sugars were increased by 31% at elevated [ CO,] and coincided with a significant increase in the density of the invasive species Popillia japonica Newman (Japanese beetle). In two-choice feeding trials, Japanese beetles and Mexican bean beetles (Epilachna varivestis Mulsant.) preferred foliage grown at elevated [CO2] to foliage grown at ambient [CO2] These data support the hypothesis that the increased level of sugar in leaves grown at elevated [CO2] may act as a phagostimulant for the Japanese beetle.

At the beginning of the OTC experiment, all trees were 7 years old. We studied the single and interaction effects of CO2 and O-3 on silver birch below-ground carbon pools (i.e. effects on fine roots and mycorrhizas, soil microbial communities and sporocarp production) and also assessed whether there are any clonal differences in these below-ground CO2 and O-3 responses. The total mycorrhizal infection level of both clones was stimulated by elevated CO2 alone and elevated O-3 alone, but not when elevated CO2 was used in fumigation in combination with elevated O-3. In both clones, elevated CO2 affected negatively light brown/orange mycorrhizas, while its effect on other mycorrhizal morphotypes was negligible. Elevated O-3, instead, clearly decreased the proportions of black and liver-brown mycorrhizas and increased that of light brown/orange mycorrhizas. Elevated O-3 had a tendency to decrease standing fine root mass and sporocarp production as well, both of these O-3 effects mainly manifesting in clone 4 trees. CO2 and O-3 treatment effects on soil microbial community composition (PLFA, 2- and 3-OH-FA profiles) were negligible, but quantitative PLFA data showed that in 2001 the PLFA fungi : bacteria-ratio of clone 80 trees was marginally increased because of elevated CO2 treatments.

The threshold ozone concentrations for these effects were 15-40 ppb above current ambient in upland UK, and were within the range of ozone concentrations anticipated for much of Europe by the latter part of this century. The potential mechanism behind the impaired stomatal functioning was investigated using a transpiration assay. Unlike for lower ozone treatments, apparently healthy green leaves of L. hispidus that had developed in the 101.3 ppb treatment did not close their stomata in response to 1.5 mu m abscisic acid (ABA); indeed stomatal opening initially occurred in this treatment. Thus, ozone appears to be disrupting the ABA-induced signal transduction pathway for stomatal control thereby reducing the ability of plants to respond to drought. These results have potentially wide-reaching implications for the functioning of communities under global warming where periods of soil drying and episodes of high vapour pressure deficit are likely to be more severe.",9.4.5,Water Cycling,0,0

Although the two exposure regimes have the same mean O-3 concentration and accumulated O-3 concentration above 40ppb (AOT40), our results show that O-3 in CF100D reduced biomass and number of pods/plant more than O-3 at CF100.

The hypotheses tested were (1) that the competitiveness of beech rather than spruce is negatively affected by the exposure to enhanced O-3 concentrations, (2) spruce benefits from the increase of resource availability (elevated CO2) in the mixed culture and (3) that the responsiveness of plants to CO2 and O-3 depends on the type of competition (i.e. intra vs. interspecific). Beech displayed a competitive disadvantage when growing in mixture with spruce: after two growing seasons under interspecific competition, beech showed significant reductions in leaf gas exchange, biomass development and crown volume as compared with beech plants growing in monoculture. In competition with spruce, beech appeared to be nitrogen (N)-limited, whereas spruce tended to benefit in terms of its plant N status. The responsiveness of the juvenile trees to the atmospheric treatments differed between species and was dominated by the type of competition: spruce growth benefited from elevated CO2 concentrations, while beech growth suffered from the enhanced O-3 regime. In general, interspecific competition enhanced these atmospheric treatment effects, supporting our hypotheses. Significant differences in root : shoot biomass ratio between the type of competition under both elevated O-3 and CO2 were not caused by readjustments of biomass partitioning, but were dependent on tree size. Our study stresses that competition is an important factor driving plant development, and suggests that the knowledge about responses of plants to elevated CO2 and/or O-3, acquired from plants growing in monoculture, may not be transferred to plants grown under interspecific competition as typically found in the field.",9.4.6.1,"Litter Carbon Chemistry, Litter Nutrient and Their Ecosystem Budgets",8.9.1,Decomposition

We hypothesized that concentrations in the soil would parallel increases seen in biological activity, due to greater net primary productivity under elevated CO2 and seasonal patterns of root growth. Chemical analysis of soils revealed marginally significant increases of total soluble sugars and total soluble phenolic acids in the elevated CO2 treatment (+ 27 mg kg(-1), +0.02 mu mol g(-1)), but there were no significant differences in concentrations due to elevated O-3 or CO2 + O-3 Total free amino acid concentrations were not affected by any of the treatments, but significant shifts in individual amino acids were observed.

This study was initiated to analyze whether ozone-stressed plants also transfer signals below ground and thereby alter the bacterial community composition in their rhizospheres. Herbaceous plants, native to Germany, with tolerance (Anthoxanthum odoratum, Achillea millefolium, Poa pratensis, Rumex acetosa, and Veronica chamaedrys) and sensitivity (Matricaria chamomilla, Sonchus asper, and Tanacetum vulgare) to ozone, raised in the greenhouse, were exposed in open-top chambers to two different ozone regimes, i.e., ""summer stress"" and a normal ozone background. DNA of bacterial cells from the rhizospheres was directly extracted, and partial sequences of the 16S rRNA genes were PCR amplified with primers targeting the following phylogenetic groups: Bacteria, alpha-Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, and Pseudomonas, respectively. The diversity of the amplified products was analyzed by genetic profiling based on single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP). Neither the tolerant nor the sensitive plants, the latter with visible above-ground damage, showed ozone-induced differences in any of the SSCP profiles, with the single exception of Actinobacteria-targeted profiles from S. asper. To increase the stress, S. asper was germinated and raised in the continuous presence of an elevated level of ozone. SSCP profiles with Bacteria-specific primers combined with gene probe hybridizations indicated an ozone-related increase in a Xanthomonas-related 16S rRNA gene and a decrease in the respective gene from the plant plastids.

In parallel, increased energy demand for O-3 detoxification and repair was suggested under elevated O-3 owing to enhanced dark respiration. Only in shade-grown leaves, light-limited photosynthesis was reduced under elevated O-3, this effect being accompanied by lowered F-v/F-m. These results suggest that chronic O-3 exposure primarily caused stomatal closure to adult beech trees in the field regardless of the within-canopy light gradient.

The aim was to detect subtle effects on leaf chlorophyll and N concentrations, leaf weight, specific leaf area (SLA), and delta O-18 and delta C-13 as proxies for gas exchange. We expected that the species' responsiveness to O-3 and N would be related to their functional traits and that N-induced changes in these traits would modify the species' response to O-3 via increased growth and higher leaf conductance (g(s)). Most species reacted to N supply with the accumulation of N and chlorophyll, but with no change in SLA, g(s), and growth, except Carex sempervirens which showed increased water use efficiency and leaf weight. Elevated O-3 reduced gs in most species, but this was not related to a reduction in leaf weight, which was recorded in half of the species. Contrary to our expectation, the magnitude of the response to both O-3 and N was not related to species-specific traits such as SLA or g(s). No pronounced O-3 x N interactions were observed. In conclusion, since for most species neither N nor gas exchange limited growth, their short-term response to O-3 and N and to their combination was small.

The objectives of our study were to assess the effects of long-term exposure to elevated CO2 and O-3, singly and in combination, on soil respiration, fine root growth and soil organisms. Fine root growth and soil organisms were included in the study as indicators of the autotrophic and heterotrophic components of soil respiration. The study evaluated three hypotheses: (1) elevated CO2 will increase C assimilation and allocation belowground increasing soil respiration; (2) elevated O-3 will decrease C assimilation and allocation belowground decreasing soil respiration and (3) as elevated CO2 and O-3 have opposing effects on C assimilation and allocation, elevated CO2 will eliminate or reduce the negative effects of elevated O-3 on soil respiration. A mixed-model covariance analysis was used to remove the influences of soil temperature, soil moisture and days from planting when testing for the effects of CO2 and O-3 on soil respiration. The covariance analysis showed that elevated CO2 significantly reduced the soil respiration while elevated O-3 had no significant effect. Despite the lack of a direct CO2 stimulation of soil respiration, there were significant interactions between CO2 and soil temperature, soil moisture and days from planting indicating that elevated CO2 altered soil respiration indirectly. In elevated CO2, soil respiration was more sensitive to soil temperature changes and less sensitive to soil moisture changes than in ambient CO2. Soil respiration increased more with days from planting in elevated than in ambient CO2.

How the concurrent increase in tropospheric ozone (O-3) concentration ([O-3]) will interact with rising atmospheric [CO2] to affect C cycling is unknown. A major component of carbon cycling in forests is fine root production, mortality and decomposition. To better understand the effects of elevated [CO2] and [O-3] on the dynamics of fine root C, we conducted a combined field and laboratory incubation experiment to monitor decomposition dynamics and changes in fine root litter chemistry. Free-air CO2 enrichment (FACE) technology at the FACTS-II Aspen FACE project in Rhinelander, Wisconsin, elevated [CO2] (535 mu l l(-1)) and [O-3] (53 nl l(-1)) in intact stands of pure trembling aspen (Populus tremuloides Michx.) and in mixed stands of trembling aspen plus paper birch (Betula papyrifera Marsh.) and trembling aspen plus sugar maple (Acer saccharum Marsh.). We hypothesized that the trees would react to increased C availability (elevated [CO2]) by increasing allocation to C-based secondary compounds (CBSCs), thereby decreasing rates of decomposition. Because of its lower growth potential, we reasoned this effect would be greatest in the aspen-maple community relative to the aspen and aspen-birch communities. As a result of decreased C availability, we expected elevated [O-3] to counteract shifts in C allocation induced by elevated [CO2]. Concentrations of CBSCs were rarely significantly affected by the CO2 and O-3 treatments in decomposing fine roots. Rates of microbial respiration and mass loss from fine roots were unaffected by the treatments, although the production of dissolved organic C differed among communities. We conclude that elevated [CO2] and [O-3] induce only small changes in fine root chemistry that are insufficient to significantly influence fine root decomposition.

Our database consisted of 63 studies conducted on 22 species of trees and published between 1990 and 2005. Ozone alone had no overall effect on concentrations of carbohydrates or nutrients, whereas in combination with CO2, elevated O3 reduced nutrient concentrations and increased carbohydrate concentrations. In contrast to primary metabolites, concentrations of phenolics and terpenes were significantly increased by 16% and 8%, respectively, in response to elevated O3. Effects of ozone in combination with elevated CO2 were weaker than those of ozone alone on phenolics, but stronger than those of ozone alone on terpenes. The magnitude of secondary metabolite responses depended on the type of ozone exposure facility and increased in the following order: indoor growth chamber < open-top chamber < free-air ozone exposure. The results of meta-analysis demonstrated that, in terms of leaf chemistry, angiosperms are more responsive to elevated O3 than gymnosperms, as shifts in concentrations of carbohydrate and phenolics were observed in the former, but not in the latter. Elevated O3 had positive effects on some indices of insect performance: pupal mass increased and larval development time shortened, but these effects were counteracted by elevated CO2. Therefore, despite the observed increase in secondary metabolites, elevated O3 tends to increase tree foliage quality for herbivores, but elevated CO2 may alleviate these effects.

Enclosure within the OTCs increased aboveground biomass but decreased root yield (fresh biomass) and sugar content.

Human-induced climate changes threaten the health of forest ecosystems. In particular, carbon dioxide (CO2) and tropospheric ozone (O-3) will likely have significant but opposing impacts on forests and their associated insect communities. Compared with other animal groups, insect communities are expected to be especially sensitive to changes in global climate. 2. This study examined the effects of elevated CO2 and O-3 (eCO(2) and eO(2)) individually and in combination on the abundance, diversity and composition of forest insect communities. Insects were sampled using yellow pan traps in an aggrading aspen-birch forest at the Aspen Free Air CO2 Enrichment (FACE) site in northern Wisconsin, USA. We trapped for 24 h every 10-15 days throughout the summers ( June to September) of 2000-2003. 3. We examined 47 415 insects from 4 orders and 83 families. Elevated CO2 reduced abundance of phloem-feeding herbivores and increased abundance of chewing herbivores, although results were not statistically significant. Enriched CO2 increased numbers of some parasitoids. The effects of eO(3) on insect abundance were generally opposite those of eCO(2). No significant differences in arthropod family richness were found among treatments. However, eCO(2), eO(3), or both significantly affected insect community composition in all years. 4. Carbon dioxide and tropospheric ozone have the potential to alter significantly forest insect communities. Feeding guild may strongly influence insect response to environmental change and may provide the best opportunity to generalise for conservation efforts. Because insect communities influence forest health and ecosystem services, continued research on their response to global change is critically important to forest management and conservation.",9.4.9.1,Insects,8.6.2,Population- and Community Level Responses

By contrast, in the southern French Alps and in the Carpathians 1-year-old needles of Pinus cembra trees showed visual symptoms similar to those observed in O-3 stressed pine stands in southern California. For the southern French Alps the observed symptoms could clearly be attributed O-3 and differences in O-3 uptake seems to be the likely key factor for explaining the observed decline. For the Carpathians however, other reasons such as drought may not be excluded in eliciting the observed symptoms.

This paper reports genotypic variations in O-3 sensitivity in 20 winter wheat cultivars released over the past 60 years in China highlighting O-3-induced mechanisms. Wheat plants were exposed to elevated O-3 (82 ppb O-3, 7 h day(-1)) or charcoal-filtered air (< 5 ppb O-3) for 21 days in open top chambers. Responses to O-3 were assessed by the levels of antioxidative activities, protein alteration, membrane lipid peroxidation, gas exchange, leaf chlorophyll, dark respiration and growth. We found that O-3 significantly reduced foliar ascorbate (-14%) and soluble protein (-22%), but increased peroxidase activity (+46%) and malondialdehyde (+38%). Elevated O-3 depressed light saturated net photosynthetic rate (-24%), stomatal conductance (-8%) and total chlorophyll (-11%), while stimulated dark respiration (+28%) and intercellular CO2 concentration (+39%). O-3 also reduced overall plant growth, but to a greater extent in root (-32%) than in shoot (-17%) biomass. There was significant genotypic variation in potential sensitivity to O-3 that did not correlate to observed O-3 tolerance. Sensitivity to O-3 in cultivars of winter wheat progressed with year of release and correlated with stomatal conductance and dark respiration in O-3-exposed plants. O-3-induced loss in photosynthetic rate was attributed primarily to impaired activity of mesophyll cells and loss of integrity of cellular membrane as evidenced by increased intercellular CO2 concentration and lipid peroxidation. Our findings demonstrated that higher sensitivity to O-3 in the more recently released cultivars was induced by higher stomatal conductance, larger reduction in antioxidative capacity and lower levels of dark respiration leading to higher oxidative damage to proteins and integrity of cellular membranes.",9.4.4,Crop Yield and Quality in Agricultural Systems,0,0

Global change effects on secondary chemicals appear to be plant species-specific and dependent on the chemical type. Even though plant chemical responses induced by these factors are highly variable, there seems to be some specificity in the response to different environmental stressors. For example, even though the production of phenolic compounds is enhanced by both elevated CO2 and UV light levels, the latter appears to primarily increase the concentrations of flavonoids. Likewise, specific phenolic metabolites seem to be induced by O-3 but not by other factors, and an increase in volatile organic compounds has been particularly detected under elevated temperature.

The tuber concentrations of N, P, K and Mg correlated positively with O-3 exposure (although not significantly in the case of N and P) but the O-3 exposure had no effect on the tuber concentration of Ca. A likely mechanism behind the observed O-3 effects was suggested to be that the more progressed senescence of O-3 exposed plants was associated with a larger extent of reallocation of mobile nutrients from the haulm to the tubers. In addition, the uptake of macronutrients may have been less negatively affected by O-3 exposure than the assimilation of carbon. O-3 tended to reduce the total tuber contents of all investigated nutrients, which imply a reduced fertilizer need per unit field area. This was not associated with a decreased fertilizer need per tonnage of yield, as the tuber nutrient concentrations were increased by O-3 exposure. The increased CO2 concentration did not significantly affect any of the investigated macronutrients in the present dataset but did generally prevent the O-3 induced increases in nutrient concentrations to be expressed (only significant in the case of N and Mg). The O-3 induced increase in tuber K concentration, may mediate earlier observed O-3 effects on potato tuber concentrations of citric and malic acids. To conclude, anticipated future (and even presently occurring) O-3 exposure has a negative impact on the total tuber contents of K and Ca and probably also on the total tuber contents of N, P and Mg.

In the dominant microorganisms using carbon sources of carbohydrates and amino acids groups were significantly reduced by an elevated O-3 concentration in the rhizosphere soil. Our study shows that the elevated ozone levels may alter microbial community function in rhizosphere soil but not in the bulk soil. Hence, this suggests that O-3 effects on soil microbes are caused by O-3 detriments on the plant, but not by the O-3 direct effects on the soil microbes.",9.4.6.2,Decomposer Metabolism and Litter Decomposition,0,0

The results suggested that elevated [O-3] decreased wheat grain yield by 29% (CI: 24-34%) and aboveground biomass by 18% (CI: 13-24%), where CI is the 95% confidence interval. Even in studies where the [O-3] range was between 31 and 59 ppb (average 43 ppb), there was a significant decrease in the grain yield (18%) and biomass (16%) relative to CF. Despite the increase in the grain protein content (6.8%), elevated [O-3] significantly decreased the grain protein yield (-18%). Relative to CF, elevated [O-3] significantly decreased photosynthetic rates (-20%), Rubisco activity (-19%), stomatal conductance (-22%), and chlorophyll content (-40%). For the whole plant, rising [O-3] induced a larger decrease in belowground (-27%) biomass than in aboveground (-18%) biomass. There was no significant response difference between spring wheat and winter wheat. Wheat grown in the field showed larger decreases in leaf photosynthesis parameters than wheat grown in < 5 L pots. Open-top chamber fumigation induced a larger reduction than indoor growth chambers, when plants were exposed to elevated [O-3]. The detrimental effect was progressively greater as the average daily [O-3] increased, with very few exceptions. The impact of O-3 increased with developmental stages, with the largest detrimental impact during grain filling. Both drought and elevated [CO2] significantly ameliorated the detrimental effects of elevated [O-3], which could be explained by a significant decrease in O-3 uptake resulting from decreased stomatal conductance.",9.4.4,Crop Yield and Quality in Agricultural Systems,8.5.1,Field Studies and Meta Analyses

We found that elevated CO2 had no overall effects on litter decomposition rates, whereas elevated O-3 reduced litter mass loss (-13%) in the first year. The effect of O-3 on mass loss disappeared in the second year. For aspen litter but not mixed birch-aspen litter, decomposition rates were negatively correlated with initial concentrations of condensed tannins and phenolics. Most soluble components (94% of soluble sugars, 99% of condensed tannins, and 91% of soluble phenolics) and any treatment effects on their initial concentrations disappeared rapidly. However, the mean residence time (MRT) of birch-aspen litter (3.1 years) was significantly lower than that of aspen litter (4.8 years). Further, because of variation in total litterfall, total litter mass, C, lignin and N remaining in the ecosystem was highest under elevated CO2 and lowest under elevated O-3 during the incubation period. Our results indicate that elevated CO2 and O-3 can alter short-term litter decomposition dynamics, but longer-term effects will depend more on indirect effects mediated through changes in forest community composition.

The concentrations of organic acids in peat pore water showed a similar trend. Elevated ozone did not affect the shoot length or the structure of the sedge E. vaginatum leaves but it slightly increased the total number of sedge leaves towards the end of the experiment.

CO2 + 300 mu l CO2 l(-1)) in a full factorial design. Saplings were analysed for various mineral nutrients in different plant organs as well as biomass production and crown development. The study was based on the assumption that nutritional parameters important for growth and competitiveness are affected by stress defence under limiting nutrient supply. The hypotheses tested were (1) that nutrient uptake-related parameters (a) as well as efficiencies in nutrient use for above-ground competition (b) of beech rather than spruce are impaired by the exposure to elevated O-3 concentrations, (2) that the efficiency in nutrient uptake of spruce is enhanced by elevated CO2 concentrations in mixed culture, and (3) that the ability to occupy above-ground space at low nutrient cost is co-determinant for the competitive success in mixed culture. Clear nitrogen deficiencies were indicated for both species during the 2-year phytotron study, although foliar nitrogen-biomass relationships were not so close for spruce than for beech. O-3 stress did not impair nutrient uptake-related parameters of beech; thus hypothesis (1a). was not supported. A negative effect of elevated O-3 (under amb. CO2) on the N and P based efficiencies in above-ground space occupation (i.e. lower crown volume per unit of N or P invested in stems, limbs and foliage) of beech supported hypothesis (1b). It appeared that ozone stress triggered a nutrient demand for stress defence and tolerance at the expense of above-ground competition (trade-off). Crown volume of beech under O-3 stress was stabilized in monoculture by increased nutrient uptake. In general, the +CO2-treatment was able to counteract the impacts of 2 X O-3. Elevated CO2 caused lower N and S concentrations in current-year foliage of both tree species, slightly higher macronutrient amounts in the root biomass of spruce, but did not increase the efficiencies in nutrient uptake of spruce in mixed culture. Therefore hypothesis (2) was not supported. At the end of the experiment spruce turned out to be the stronger competitor in mixed culture as displayed by its higher total shoot biomass and crown volume. The amounts of macronutrients in the above-ground biomass of spruce individuals in mixed culture distinctly exceeded those of beech, which had been strongly reduced by interspecific competition.

Ozone is produced by the photo-oxidation of hydrocarbons released into the atmosphere by combustion of fossil fuels. Studies demonstrate O-3 can be transported from metropolitan areas to rural areas important to agricultural and forestry practices. Reports regarding O-3 effects have focused on vegetation important to food production or agronomic crops of economic importance. However, relatively little is known about O-3 effects on native plant species.

Grasses were grown in open-top chambers with introduced carbon-filtered (CF) air, characteristic of clean air quality; non-filtered (NF) air, representative of quality in Auburn, AL; and air with double (2X) the ambient concentration of O-3. Because forage quality can be as important as quantity, we determined various effects on nutritive quality characteristics in addition to biomass yield. Big bluestem exhibited little response to O-3 exposure. For eastern gamagrass, we generally found decreased nutritive quality with increasing O-3 exposure as evidenced by increased concentrations of cell wall constituents and decreased concentrations of N. Regrowth of both species exhibited little treatment effect which emphasizes the importance of timing and duration of O-3 exposures in relation to physiological stage of plant development. Decreased nutritive quality parameters observed for eastern gamagrass may have implications to diet selection and nutrient intake by ruminant herbivores.

Thus, in a combined elevated CO2 and O-3 atmosphere, seed yield is at least restored to that of charcoal-filtered (CF) air at ambient CO2. The CO2-induced yield increase in CF air is highly variable, suggesting other potential resource limitations. To understand such variability in response, we tested that (1) competition for resources precludes some of the CO2 enhancement on biomass and yield; and (2) O-3 reduces competition in elevated CO2. We grew rice (Oryza sativa L.) at five densities in CF and O-3-fumigated (+O3) air at ambient (A) and elevated [CO2] (+CO2) in 1997 and 1998. O-3 reduced biomass by 25% and seed yield by 13-20% in A, but had little effect in +CO2. A competition model of biomass and yield response to density based on resource availability without competition showed that fewer resources were used for biomass in +O3 than in CF (average 53% vs. 70%) in A, while in +CO2 85% of resources were used for biomass regardless of O-3 suggesting greater depletion of resources. The enhanced biomass response to CO2 with O-3 is consistent with a 22% greater CO2 enhancement ratio [mass in +CO2 air/mass in A air; enhancement ratio (ER)] in +O3 than in CF air. For seed yield, few resources were used (average 17% and 25% for CF in 1997 and 1998, respectively), and ER was 13% greater in +O3. With competition the rate of change of individual plant biomass to density was not affected by +CO2 in CF air in 1997 but was increased 19% with more nutrients in 1998, indicating resource limitations with +CO2. The rate of change of individual plant yield to density was reduced with CO2 in 1997 and unchanged in 1998 showing a different response to resource limitation for reproductive biomass. The resource use in +O3-A suggested that increased density and soil fertility might compensate for pollutant damage.

On an average, elevated [CO2] (627 ppm) increased rice yields by 23%. Modest increases in grain mass and larger increases in panicle and grain number contributed to this response. The response of rice to elevated [CO2] varied with fumigation technique. The more closely the fumigation conditions mimicked field conditions, the smaller was the stimulation of yield by elevated [CO2]. Free air concentration enrichment (FACE) experiments showed only a 12% increase in rice yield. The rise in atmospheric [CO2] will be accompanied by increases in tropospheric O-3 and temperature. When compared with rice grown in charcoal-filtered air, rice exposed to 62 ppb O-3 showed a 14% decrease in yield. Many determinants of yield, including photosynthesis, biomass, leaf area index, grain number and grain mass, were reduced by elevated [O-3].

The magnitude of this stimulus will partly depend on interactions with other components of the atmosphere such as tropospheric O-3. Elevated CO2 concentrations often lessen the deleterious effects of O-3, but the mechanisms responsible for this response have received little direct examination. Previous studies have indicated that protection against O-3 injury by elevated CO2 can be attributed to reduced O-3 uptake, while other studies suggest that CO2 effects on anti-oxidant metabolism might also be involved. The aim of this experiment was to test further the roles of O-3 flux and antioxidant metabolism in the suppression of O-3 injury by elevated CO2. In a two-year experiment, soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] was exposed from emergence to maturity to charcoal-filtered air or charcoal-filtered air plus a range of O-3 concentrations in combination with ambient or approximately twice-ambient CO2 concentrations in open-top field chambers. Experimental manipulation of O-3 concentrations and estimates of plant O-3 uptake indicated that equivalent O-3 fluxes that suppressed net photosynthesis, growth, and yield at ambient concentrations of CO2 were generally much less detrimental to plants treated concurrently with elevated CO2.

Measurements of sap flux and canopy leaf area index (L) were made during two growing seasons, when steady-state L had been reached after more than 6 years of exposure to elevated [CO2] and [O-3]. Maximum stand-level sap flux wits not significantly affected by levated [O-3], but was increased by 18% by elevated [CO2] averaged across years, communities and O-3 regimes. Treatment effects were similar in pure aspen and mixed aspen-birch communities. Increased tree water use in response to elevated [CO2] was related to positive CO2 treatment effects on tree size and L (+40%). Tree water use was not reduced by elevated [O-3] despite strong negative O-3 treatment effects on tree size and L (-22%). Elevated [O-3] predisposed pure aspen stands to drought-induced Sap flux reductions, whereas increased tree water use in response to elevated [CO2] did not result in lower soil water content in the upper soil or decreasing sap flux relative to control values during dry periods. Maintenance of soil water content in the upper soil in the elevated [CO2] treatment was at least partly a function of enhanced soil water-holding capacity, probably a result of increased organic matter content from increased litter inputs. Our findings that larger trees growing in elevated [CO2] used more water and that tree size, but not maximal water use, was negatively affected by elevated [O-3] suggest that the long-term cumulative effects on stand Structure may be more important than the expected primary stomatal Closure responses to elevated [CO2] and [O-3] in determining stand-level water use under possible future atmospheric conditions.",9.4.5,Water Cycling,0,0

This phenomenon was observed in plants grown both with and without supplemental soil moisture, the latter of which should theoretically mitigate against harmful physiological effects caused by exposure to ozone. Seasonally declining rates of stomatal conductance were found to be substantial and incorporated into models, making them less susceptible to the overestimations of effective exposure that are an inherent source of error in ozone exposure indices.

Soil respiration is the second largest flux of carbon (C) in these ecosystems, and the objective of this study was to understand how soil respiration responded to the experimental treatments as these fast-growing stands of pure aspen and birch + aspen approached maximum leaf area. Rates of soil respiration were typically lowest in the elevated O-3 treatment. Elevated CO2 significantly stimulated soil respiration (8-26%) compared to the control treatment in both community types over all three growing seasons. In years 6-7 of the experiment, the greatest rates of soil respiration occurred in the interaction treatment (CO2 + O-3), and rates of soil respiration were 15-25% greater in this treatment than in the elevated CO2 treatment, depending on year and community type. Two of the treatments, elevated CO2 and elevated CO2 + O-3, were fumigated with C-13-depleted CO2, and in these two treatments we used standard isotope mixing models to understand the proportions of new and old C in soil respiration. During the peak of the growing season, C fixed since the initiation of the experiment in 1998 (new C) accounted for 60-80% of total soil respiration. The isotope measurements independently confirmed that more new C was respired from the interaction treatment compared to the elevated CO2 treatment. A period of low soil moisture late in the 2003 growing season resulted in soil respiration with an isotopic signature 4-6 parts per thousand enriched in 13 stopC compared to sample dates when the percentage soil moisture was higher. In 2004, an extended period of low soil moisture during August and early September, punctuated by a significant rainfall event, resulted in soil respiration that was temporarily 4-6 parts per thousand more depleted in C-13.

The effect of herbivory on transcription diminished strongly with time (< 1% of genes were affected by herbivory after 3 weeks), and elevated CO2 interacted more strongly with herbivory than elevated O-3.

Cotton was more sensitive than nutsedge to O-3 (reduction at HO3:75 vs. 20% in shoot growth, 33 vs. 20% in assimilation). Cotton was inhibited by O-3 and by competition and the interaction was significant for leaf properties of cotton and tuber production in nutsedge. A coefficient of competition (slope of inverse cotton shoot biomass vs. nutsedge density) was significantly increased at HO3. The species were mutually inhibitory to similar extents. Root respiration declined with O-3 in nutsedge but increased in cotton, though both species reduced allocation below-ground. Nutsedge tuber production increased inconsistently with O-3.

Previously, we have observed that elevated CO2 increased the microbial metabolism of cellulose and chitin, whereas elevated O3 dampened this response. We hypothesized that this change in metabolism under CO2 and O3 enrichment would be accompanied by a concomitant change in fungal community composition. We tested our hypothesis at the free-air CO2 and O3 enrichment (FACE) experiment at Rhinelander, Wisconsin, in which Populus tremuloides, Betula papyrifera, and Acer saccharum were grown under factorial CO2 and O3 treatments. We employed extracellular enzyme analysis to assay microbial metabolism, phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) analysis to determine changes in microbial community composition, and polymerase chain reaction?denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (PCR?DGGE) to analyze the fungal community composition. The activities of 1,4-?-glucosidase (+37%) and 1,4,-?-N-acetylglucosaminidase (+84%) were significantly increased under elevated CO2, whereas 1,4-?-glucosidase activity (?25%) was significantly suppressed by elevated O3. There was no significant main effect of elevated CO2 or O3 on fungal relative abundance, as measured by PLFA. We identified 39 fungal taxonomic units from soil using DGGE, and found that O3 enrichment significantly altered fungal community composition. We conclude that fungal metabolism is altered under elevated CO2 and O3, and that there was a concomitant change in fungal community composition under elevated O3.

Because exposure to elevated CO2 can alter the nutritional value of leaves, some herbivores may increase consumption rates to compensate. The effects of O3 on leaf nutritional quality are less clear; however, increased senescence may also reduce leaf quality for insect herbivores. Additionally, changes in secondary chemistry and the microclimate of leaves may
render plants more susceptible to herbivory in elevated CO2 and O3. Damage to soybean (Glycine max L.) leaves and the size and composition of the insect community in the plant canopy were examined in large intact plots exposed to elevated CO2 (*550 lmol mol-1) and elevated O3 (1.2*ambient) in a fully factorial design with a Soybean Free Air Concentration Enrichment system (SoyFACE). Leaf area removed by folivorous insects was estimated by digital photography and insect surveys were conducted during two consecutive growing seasons, 2003 and 2004. Elevated CO2 alone and in combination with O3 increased the number of insects and the amount of leaf area removed by insect herbivores across feeding guilds. Exposure to elevated CO2 significantly increased the number of western corn rootworm (Diabrotica virgifera) adults (foliage chewer) and soybean aphids (Aphis glycines; phloem feeder). No consistent effect of elevated O3 on herbivory or insect population size was detected. Increased loss of leaf area to herbivores was associated with increased carbon-tonitrogen ratio and leaf surface temperature.

Fumigation treatments consisted of replicated ambient, +CO2, +O3, and +CO2 + O3 FACE rings. We followed mass loss and litter chemistry over 23 months, using reciprocally transplanted litterbags to separate substrate quality from environment effects. Aspen decayed more slowly than birch across all treatment conditions, and changes in decomposition dynamics of both species were driven by shifts in substrate quality rather than by fumigation environment. Aspen litter produced under elevated CO2 decayed more slowly than litter produced under ambient CO2, and this effect was exacerbated by elevated O3. Similarly, birch litter produced under elevated CO2 also decayed more slowly than litter produced under ambient CO2. In contrast to results for aspen, however, elevated O3 accelerated birch decay under ambient CO2, but decelerated decay under enriched CO2. Changes in decomposition rates (k-values) were due to CO2- and O3-mediated shifts in litter quality, particularly levels of carbohydrates, nitrogen, and tannins.

For small perturbations to emissions, the global radiative forcing resulting from changes in O3 can be expressed as a sum of forcings from emission changes in different regions. Tropospheric O3 is considered in present climate policies only through the inclusion of indirect effect of CH4 on radiative forcing through its impact on O3 concentrations. The short-lived O3 precursors (NO  x  , CO, and NMHCs) are not directly included in the Kyoto Protocol or any similar climate mitigation agreement. In this study, we quantify the global radiative forcing resulting from a marginal reduction (10%) in anthropogenic emissions of NO  x   alone from nine geographic regions and a combined marginal reduction in NO  x  , CO, and NMHCs emissions from three regions. We simulate, using the global chemistry transport model MOZART-2, the change in the distribution of global O3 resulting from these emission reductions. In addition to the short-term reduction in O3, these emission reductions also increase CH4 concentrations (by decreasing OH); this increase in CH4 in turn counteracts part of the initial reduction in O3 concentrations. We calculate the global radiative forcing resulting from the regional emission reductions, accounting for changes in both O3 and CH4. Our results show that changes in O3 production and resulting distribution depend strongly on the geographical location of the reduction in precursor emissions. We find that the global O3 distribution and radiative forcing are most sensitive to changes in precursor emissions from tropical regions and least sensitive to changes from midlatitude and high-latitude regions. Changes in CH4 and O3 concentrations resulting from NO  x   emission reductions alone produce offsetting changes in radiative forcing, leaving a small positive residual forcing (warming) for all regions. In contrast, for combined reductions of anthropogenic emissions of NO  x  , CO, and NMHCs, changes in O3 and CH4 concentrations result in a net negative radiative forcing (cooling). Thus we conclude that simultaneous reductions of CO, NMHCs, and NO  x   lead to a net reduction in radiative forcing due to resulting changes in tropospheric O3 and CH4 while reductions in NO  x   emissions alone do not.",1.3.4,Competing Effects of O3 Precursors on Climate,0,0

With multidecadal full-chemistry transient simulations in the MOZART-2 tropospheric chemistry model, we show that tropospheric O-3 responds approximately linearly to changes in CH4 emissions over a range of anthropogenic emissions from 0-430 Tg CH4 a(-1) (0.11-0.16 Tg tropospheric O-3 or similar to 11-15 ppt global mean surface O-3 decrease per Tg a(-1) CH4 reduced). We find that neither the air quality nor climate benefits depend strongly on the location of the CH4 emission reductions, implying that the lowest cost emission controls can be targeted. With a series of future (2005-2030) transient simulations, we demonstrate that cost-effective CH4 controls would offset the positive climate forcing from CH4 and O-3 that would otherwise occur (from increases in NOx and CH4 emissions in the baseline scenario) and improve O-3 air quality. We estimate that anthropogenic CH4 contributes 0.7 Wm(-2) to climate forcing and similar to 4 ppb to surface O-3 in 2030 under the baseline scenario. Although the response of surface O-3 to CH4 is relatively uniform spatially compared to that from other O-3 precursors, it is strongest in regions where surface air mixes frequently with the free troposphere and where the local O-3 formation regime is NOx-saturated. In the model, CH4 oxidation within the boundary layer (below similar to 2.5 km) contributes more to surface O-3 than CH4 oxidation in the free troposphere. In NOx-saturated regions, the surface O-3 sensitivity to CH4 can be twice that of the global mean, with &gt; 70% of this sensitivity resulting from boundary layer oxidation of CH4.

The three models react differently to the forcings, as feedback mechanisms such as sea-ice albedo and clouds behave differently in each model. However, we find that their climate sensitivities u (defined as the ratio of the globally averaged surface temperature change to the radiative forcing), normalised by the climate sensitivity for a control case (e.g. CO2 added globally), match each other to within 30% in most experiments. Moreover, the models indicate generic deviations of u from the case of global CO2 perturbations: upper tropospheric O3 increases generally produce lower values of u, while lower stratospheric O3 perturbations lead to higher values of u, as found in some previous work. u tends to be higher for extratropical forcings than tropical forcings; a phenomenon which can be partially accounted for by a new explanation based on the variation of the outgoing longwave radiation with latitude.

In the summer, when photochemistry is most intense, photochemically generated ozone is found in large concentrations over and downwind from where anthropogenic sources are largest, such as the eastern United States and eastern China. In the tropics and the subtropics, where photon flux is strong throughout the year, trace gas concentrations are driven by the abundance of the emissions. The largest single tropical source of pollution is biomass burning, as can be seen readily in carbon monoxide measurements, but lightning and biogenic trace gases may also contribute to trace gas variability.

To determine effects of consuming foliage of soybean (Glycine max) grown under elevated CO2 on adult survivorship and fecundity, Japanese beetles (Popillia japonica Newman) were fed for the duration of their adult lives leaves grown under elevated CO2 (550 mu mol/mol), under ambient atmosphere (370 mu mol/mol), or grown under ambient atmosphere but supplemented with a solution of sugars. To determine effects of a diet of foliage grown under elevated ozone (O-3), another anthropogenic gaseous pollutant, beetles in the laboratory were fed soybean leaves grown under elevated CO2, elevated O-3, or a combination of both elevated gases. Leaf tissue was also analyzed for longevity-enhancing antioxidants, because increases in dietary antioxidants can increase lifespan. Lifespan of Japanese beetles was prolonged by 8-25% when fed foliage developed under elevated CO2 but consuming foliage that had taken up sugars to approximately the same level as foliage grown under elevated CO2 had no effect on fecundity or longevity. Females consuming elevated CO2 foliage that approximately twice as many eggs as females fed foliage grown under ambient conditions. Consuming foliage grown under elevated O-3 had no effect on fecundity. No significant differences in total antioxidant content of foliage from ambient and elevated CO2 conditions were detected. Although the precise mechanism is unclear, by altering components of leaf chemistry other than sugar content, elevated CO2 may increase populations of Japanese beetles and their impact on crop productivity.",9.4.9.1,Insects,0,0

Methane and ozone are also important greenhouse gases. Reducing methane emissions therefore decreases surface ozone everywhere while slowing climate warming, but although methane mitigation has been considered to address climate change, it has not for air quality. Here we show that global decreases in surface ozone concentrations, due to methane mitigation, result in substantial and widespread decreases in premature human mortality. Reducing global anthropogenic methane emissions by 20% beginning in 2010 would decrease the average daily maximum 8-h surface ozone by approximately 1 part per billion by volume globally. By using epidemiologic ozone-mortality relationships, this ozone reduction is estimated to prevent approximately 30,000 premature all-cause mortalities globally in 2030, and approximately 370,000 between 2010 and 2030. If only cardiovascular and respiratory mortalities are considered, approximately 17,000 global mortalities can be avoided in 2030. The marginal cost-effectiveness of this 20% methane reduction is estimated to be approximately 420,000 US dollars per avoided mortality. If avoided mortalities are valued at 1 US dollars million each, the benefit is approximately 240 US dollars per tone of CH(4) ( approximately 12 US dollars per tone of CO(2) equivalent), which exceeds the marginal cost of the methane reduction. These estimated air pollution ancillary benefits of climate-motivated methane emission reductions are comparable with those estimated previously for CO(2). Methane mitigation offers a unique opportunity to improve air quality globally and can be a cost-effective component of international ozone management, bringing multiple benefits for air quality, public health, agriculture, climate, and energy.",1.5.1,Summary of the Effects of Tropospheric O3 on Climate,0,0

Sequentially, plants are exposed to ambient O3 that (1) moves through the leaf boundary layer, (2) is taken up into plant tissue primarily through stomata, and (3) undergoes chemical interaction within plant tissue, first by initiating alterations and then as part of plant detoxification and repair. In this paper, we discuss the linkage of the temporal variability of apoplastic ascorbate with the diurnal variability of defense mechanisms in plants and compare this variability with daily maximum O3 concentration and diurnal uptake and entry of O3 into the plant through stomata. We describe the quantitative evidence on temporal variability in concentration and uptake and find that the time incidence for maximum defense does not necessarily match diurnal patterns for maximum O3 concentration or maximum uptake. We suggest that the observed out-of-phase association of the diurnal patterns for the above three processes produces a nonlinear relationship that results in a greater response from the higher hourly average O3 concentrations than from the lower or mid-level values. The fact that these out-of-phase processes affect the relationship between O3 exposure/dose and vegetation effects ultimately impact the ability of flux-based indices to predict vegetation effects accurately for purposes of standard setting and critical levels. Based on the quantitative aspect of temporal variability identified in this paper, we suggest that the inclusion of a diurnal pattern for detoxification in effective flux-based models would improve the predictive characteristics of the models. While much of the current information has been obtained using high O3 exposures, future research results derived from laboratory biochemical experiments that use short but elevated O3 exposures should be combined with experimental results that use ambient-type exposures over longer periods of time. It is anticipated that improved understanding will come from future research focused on diurnal variability in plant defense mechanisms and their relationship to the diurnal variability in ambient O3 concentration and stomatal conductance. This should result in more reliable O3 exposure standards and critical levels.",9.5.1,Introduction,0,0

Much work has been done to assess the impacts of these pollutants on trees, but little is known about how the diverse understory flora has fared. Understory vegetation has declined in diversity in response to elevated N in the eastern U.S. and Europe. Six sites along an ozone and N deposition gradient that had been part of a long-term study on response of plants to air pollution beginning in 1973 were resampled in 2003. Historic ozone data and leaf injury scores confirmed the gradient. Present-day ozone levels were almost half of these, and recent atmospheric N pollution concentrations confirmed the continued air pollution gradient. Both total and extractable soil N were higher in sites on the western end of the gradient closer to the urban source of pollution, pH was lower, and soil carbon (C) and litter were higher. The gradient also had decreasing precipitation and increasing elevation from west to east. However, the dominant tree species were the same across the gradient. Tree basal area increased during the 30-year interval in five of the sites. The two westernmost sites had 30-45% cover divided equally between native and exotic understory herbaceous species, while the other sites had only 3-13% cover dominated by native species. The high production is likely related to higher precipitation at the western sites as well as elevated N. The species richness was in the range of 24 to 30 in four of the sites, but one site of intermediate N deposition had 42 species, while the easternmost, least polluted site had 57 species. These were primarily native species, as no site had more than one to three exotic species. In three of six sites, 20-40% of species were lost between 1973 and 2003, including the two westernmost sites. Two sites with intermediate pollution had little change in total species number over 30 years, and the easternmost site had more species in 2003. The easternmost site is also the driest and has the most sunlight filtering to the forest floor, possibly accounting for the higher species richness. The confounding effects of the precipitation gradient and possibly local disturbances do not show a simple correlation of air pollution with patterns of native and invasive species cover and richness. Nevertheless, the decline of native species and dominance by exotic species in the two westernmost polluted sites is cause for concern that air pollution is affecting the understory vegetation adversely.",9.4.7.1,Forest,8.1.1.1,Forest

The analysis of data from experiments with single plants, binary mixtures and multi-species communities illustrates the difficulties to relate individual responses to communities, and thus to identify grassland communities most at risk. Although there is increasing evidence that communities can be separated into broad classes of ozone sensitivity, the database from experiments under realistic conditions with representative systems is too small to draw firm conclusions. But it appears that risk assessments, based on results from individuals or immature mixtures exposed in chambers, are only applicable to intensively managed, productive grasslands, and that the risk of ozone damage for most of perennial grasslands with lower productivity tends to be less than previously expected.

As soon as they are emitted to the atmosphere, however, hydrocarbons are destroyed by chemical reactions involving pollutants such as ozone. It is therefore likely that increased air pollution interferes with pollinator attracting hydrocarbon signals. To test this hypothesis, a Lagrangian diffusion model was used to determine the position of air parcels away from hydrocarbon sources and to estimate the rate of chemical destruction of hydrocarbons as air parcels moved across the landscape. The hydrocarbon compounds linalool, beta-myrcene, and beta-ocimene were chosen because they are known to be common scents released from flowers. The suppressed ambient abundances of volatile organic compounds were determined in response to increased regional levels of ozone, hydroxyl, and nitrate radicals. The results indicate that the documented increases in air pollution concentrations, from pre-industrial to present times, can lead to reductions in volatile compound concentrations insects detect as they pollinate flowers. For highly reactive volatiles the maximum downwind distance from the source at which pollinators can detect the scents may have changed from kilometers during pre-industrial times to < 200 m during the more polluted conditions of present times. The increased destruction of floral signals in polluted air masses may have important implications for both pollinators and signaling plants. When patches of flowers are further apart than the visual range of pollinators, such as in fragmented landscapes, the loss of scent signals may mean that pollinators spend more time searching for patches and less time foraging. This decrease in pollinator foraging efficiency will simultaneously decrease the pollinator's reproductive output and the amount of pollen flow in flowering plants.

Terpenes and some GLVs are readily oxidized by ozone (O-3), an important oxidant of the low atmosphere and predicted to increase as a result of anthropogenic activity. It has been recently reported that O-3 degradation of terpenes and GLVs does not affect signaling in two selected tritrophic systems. Natural enemies may have learned to use oxidation products that are more stable in nature to locate their prey. To understand the role of these compounds on the tritrophic system Brassica oleracea-Plutella xylostella-Cotesia plutellae, we assessed the preference of wasps to different combinations of cabbage VOCs (intact vs. herbivore-induced and herbivore-induced vs. herbivore-induced VOCs) in the presence or absence of O-3.

Leaves of the potato plants were then inoculated with Phytophthora infestans zoospores. Plants from the ""high CO2"" variant showed a significantly increased resistance to the pathogen, verified by visual evaluation and quantitative real-time PCR, whereas plants treated with double ambient ozone were slightly more susceptible. An increase in the constitutive activities of the PR-proteins beta-1,3-glucanase and osmotin in leaves of plants exposed to 700 ppm CO2 correlated with the increase in resistance at this CO2-concentration. Biomass parameters were barely affected by the elevated CO2-concentration but decreased with increasing ozone concentrations. Biochemical analyses revealed that the content of starch as well as the content of soluble sugars in leaves were highest at the double ambient ozone/700 ppm CO2 variants pointing to an ozone-induced inhibition of assimilate allocation from leaves to tubers. Leaf C/N-ratio increased at elevated CO2-concentrations due to a decrease in N-content.

Ozone effects were more adverse in the root system, inducing an impairment of the aerial/subterranean biomass ratio.

With potato, current [O-3] (31-50 ppb) reduced the yield by 5.3%, and it reduced the yield of barley, wheat and rice by 8.9%. 9.7% and 17.5%, respectively. In bean and soybean, the yield losses were 19.0% and 7.7%, respectively. Compared with yield loss at current [O-3], future [O-3] (51-75 ppb) drove a further 10% loss in yield of soybean, wheat and rice, and 20% loss in bean. Mass of individual grain, seed, or tuber was often the major cause of the yield loss at current and future [O-3], whereas other yield components also contributed to the yield loss in some cases. No significant difference was found between the responses in crops grown in pots and those in the ground for any yield parameters. The ameliorating effect of elevated [CO2] was significant in the yields of wheat and potato. and the individual grain weight in wheat exposed to future [O-3]. These findings confirm the rising [O-3] as a threat to food security for the growing global population in this century. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

The experiment was carried out in open-top chambers using three different O-3 exposure treatments: charcoal-filtered air (CFA), non-filtered air (NFA) and non-filtered air plus 40 nl l(-1) added over ambient concentrations (NFA+). After 30 days of exposure to the different treatments, plants were placed under ambient conditions until seed ripeness was completed. Three N fertilization treatments were established receiving final doses of 10 (low), 30 (medium) or 60 (high) kg N ha(-1) throughout the growing period divided into four proportional doses at every 15 days. Ozone affected phenology and reduced total aerial and flower biomass and seed production in NFA and NFA+ treatments. Carry-over effects of O-3 on the reproductive ability of this species were found resulting in reductions in flower biomass and seed production detected 1 month after O-3 exposure. By contrast, N fertilization increased aerial and flower biomass. Significant O-3 x N interactive effects were detected since N fertilization counterbalanced O-3-induced effects only when plants were exposed to moderate O-3 levels (NFA) but not under high O-3 concentrations (NFA+). The observed O-3 effects on reproductive ability of T striatum might determine changes in species viability and future diversity of the ecosystem. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Besides regulating the relationship between plants and their ecosystems, phytochemicals are involved both in resistance against pathogens and in tolerance towards abiotic stresses, such as atmospheric pollution. Plant defence metabolites arise from the main secondary metabolic routes, the phenylpropanoid, the isoprenoid and the alkaloid pathways. In plants, antibiotic compounds can be both preformed (phytoanticipins) and inducible ( phytoalexins), the former including saponins, cyanogenic glycosides and glucosinolates. Chronic exposure to tropospheric ozone (O-3) stimulates the carbon fluxes from the primary to the secondary metabolic pathways to a great extent, inducing a shift of the available resources in favour of the synthesis of secondary products. In some cases, the plant defence responses against pathogens and environmental pollutants may overlap, leading to the unspecific synthesis of similar molecules, such as phenylpropanoids. Exposure to ozone can also modify the pattern of biogenic volatile organic compounds (BVOC), emitted from plant in response to herbivore feeding, thus altering the tritrophic interaction among plant, phytophagy and their natural enemies. Finally, the synthesis of ethylene and polyamines can be regulated by ozone at level of S-adenosylmethionine (SAM), the biosynthetic precursor of both classes of hormones, which can, therefore, mutually inhibit their own biosynthesis with consequence on plant phenotype.",9.4.9.3,Indirect Effects on Wildlife,8.7.2,Pollinator Attraction and Plant Host Detection

Ozone sensitivity in rice cultivars is often evaluated based on visible leaf injury at an early growth stage. However, it is not clear whether reduction in grain yield is related to visible injury. Therefore, visible damage and grain yield reduction were examined in Japanese and Asian rice cultivars exposed to ozone. In experiment 1, 3-week-old rice seedlings were exposed to ozone (min.: 20 nl center dot l-1, max.:120 nl center dot l-1) for 12 h in open-top chambers (OTCs).

Daily mean ozone concentrations were maintained at 2, 23, 28, 42, and 57 nl center dot l-1 with a regular diurnal pattern of exposure. After harvest, grain yield was determined. Based on visible injury to the uppermost fully expanded leaf, the indica cultivar 'Kasalath' was most tolerant, and the japonica cultivar 'Kirara 397' was most sensitive to ozone. However, grain yields for both 'Kasalath' and 'Kirara 397' were significantly decreased after ozone exposure. The indica cultivar 'Jothi' suffered severe injury after ozone exposure but had no reduction in grain yield. Therefore, ozone sensitivity of rice cultivars evaluated by visible injury did not coincide with that evaluated by the reductions in grain yield.

The study is based on modelled global hourly ozone fields for the year 2000 and 2030, using the global 1??1? 2-way nested atmospheric chemical transport model (TM5). Projections for the year 2030 are based on the relatively optimistic ?current legislation (CLE) scenario?, i.e. assuming that currently approved air quality legislation will be fully implemented by the year 2030, without a further development of new abatement policies. For both runs, the relative yield loss due to ozone damage is evaluated based on two different indices (accumulated concentration above a 40 ppbV threshold and seasonal mean daytime ozone concentration respectively) on a global, regional and national scale. The cumulative metric appears to be far less robust than the seasonal mean, while the seasonal mean shows satisfactory agreement with measurements in Europe, the US, China and Southern India and South-East Asia.

Present day global relative yield losses are estimated to range between 7% and 12% for wheat, between 6% and 16% for soybean, between 3% and 4% for rice, and between 3% and 5% for maize (range resulting from different metrics used). Taking into account possible biases in our assessment, introduced through the global application of ?western? crop exposure?response functions, and through model performance in reproducing ozone-exposure metrics, our estimates may be considered as being conservative.

Under the 2030 CLE scenario, the global situation is expected to deteriorate mainly for wheat (additional 2?6% loss globally) and rice (additional 1?2% loss globally). India, for which no mitigation measures have been assumed by 2030, accounts for 50% of these global increase in crop yield loss. On a regional-scale, significant reductions in crop losses by CLE-2030 are only predicted in Europe (soybean) and China (wheat).

Translating these assumed yield losses into total global economic damage for the four crops considered, using world market prices for the year 2000, we estimate an economic loss in the range $14?$26 billion. About 40% of this damage is occurring in China and India. Considering the recent upward trends in food prices, the ozone-induced damage to crops is expected to offset a significant portion of the GDP growth rate, especially in countries with an economy based on agricultural production.",9.4.4,Crop Yield and Quality in Agricultural Systems,8.5.2,Yield Loss at Regional and National Scales

The dataset originated from 13 European open-top chamber experiments, including three countries, 10 years and four cultivars. The O3 exposure significantly reduced the protein yield, even though the grain protein concentration (GPC) was increased and tended to increase the Zeleny value and the Hagberg falling number. These variables reached values representing enhanced grain maturity after elevated O3 exposure, possibly explained by O3 induced early senescence. The CO2 elevation was demonstrated to increase the protein yield but reduce the GPC and the Zeleny value. Both O3 and CO2 were demonstrated to affect wheat grain yield (GY) but by different means; O3 reduced GY (P < 0.001) mainly by limiting the 1000-grain weight, while CO2 enhanced GY (P < 0.01) mainly by increasing the number of grains produced per unit ground area. Two earlier used O3 indices, the accumulated stomatal uptake of O3 above a flux threshold of 6 nmol m?2 s?1 (AFst6), and the accumulated O3 dose above a concentration threshold of 40 nmol mol?1 (AOT40), were employed in parallel in the derivation of dose?response relationships with all investigated variables (GY, number of grains per unit area, 1000-grain weight, protein yield, GPC, Zeleny value, wet gluten, dry gluten, starch concentration, Hagberg falling number, specific weight and water quotient). The uptake-based index (AFst6) tended to better explain variation in the response variables and yielded dose?response regressions of a higher statistical quality than did the external-dose index (AOT40). Based on an independent subset of the present data, the validities of (1) a negative linear relationship between GPC and GY and (2) a positive but decelerating relationship between protein yield and GY including both O3 and CO2 treatments were tested and confirmed.

The leaf litter grown under elevated CO2 had increased concentrations (weight per mass unit) and contents (weight per leaf) of phenolic acids, flavonol glycosides, condensed tannins and total measured phenolics. Elevated O3 increased the concentrations of 3,4?-dihydroxypropiophenone 3-?-d-glucoside (DHPPG) and flavonoid aglycones but only under ambient CO2. However, elevated O3 effects on the content of some low-molecular-weight phenolic (LMWP) compounds (i.e. phenolic acids, DHPPG, flavonoid aglycones) and total LMWP changed over time emphasizing the importance of conducting long-term (>3 years) exposure studies. In general, RGR of young L. terrestris was affected by the litter quality changes induced by elevated CO2 and O3, as the animal growth rates were reduced when they were fed with CO2- and O3-exposed leaf litter of clone 80 in Experiment 1. P. scaber RCR or RGR responses to CO2- and O3-induced changes in litter quality were more variable and inconsistent, and neither were there any litter-mediated CO2 and O3 effects on animal mortality in these microcosm experiments.

The data suggest higher ozone sensitivity of plants growing in the fen-type peatland, that the impacts on the vegetation may affect soil carbon characteristics through a reduction in root exudates and that there may have been a shift in the source of substrate DOC for microbial consumption from vegetation exudates to native soil carbon.

Discrepancy between heights measured for this study and previously calculated heights required revision of earlier allometrically based biomass determinations, resulting in higher (up to 50%) estimates of standing biomass and net primary productivity than previous assessments. Generally, elevated [CO2] caused sustained increases in plant biomass production and in standing C, but did not affect the partitioning of C among plant biomass pools. Spatial variation in net primary productivity and its [CO2]-induced enhancement was controlled primarily by N availability, with the difference between precipitation and potential evapotranspiration explaining most interannual variability. Consequently, [CO2]-induced net primary productivity enhancement ranged from 22 to 30% in different plots and years.

During the summer season, we calculated that a large portion of the total ozone flux was due to non-stomatal processes, which is in agreement with previous studies suggesting that chemical reactions with BVOCs (biogenic volatile organic compounds) emitted by the ecosystem are mainly responsible for this ozone flux. We also report here the first direct measurement of BVOCA +A ozone oxidation products, confirming that ozone loss process is occurring below our flux measurement height. We analyzed the correlations of common ozone exposure metrics based on accumulation of concentrations (AOT40 and SUM0) with ozone fluxes (total, stomatal and non-stomatal). Stomatal flux, which is considered responsible for ozone damage, showed a weaker correlation with ozone concentrations than non-stomatal flux during summer and fall seasons. The non-stomatal flux is more strongly correlated with ozone concentration because BVOC emission and ozone concentration both increase with temperature.

During fumigation, stomatal conductance measurements were made over the lifespan of the flag leaf across a range of environmental conditions. Although significant intra-specific variation in 'ozone sensitivity' (in terms of impacts on yield) was identified, yield was inversely related (R <sup>2</sup> = 0.63, P < 0.001) to the accumulated hourly averaged ozone exposure above 40 ppb during daylight hours (AOT40) across the dataset. The adverse effect of ozone on yield was principally due to a decline in seed weight. Algorithms defining the influence of environmental variables on stomatal uptake were subtly different from those currently in use, based on data for spring wheat, to map ozone impacts on pan-European cereal yield. Considerable intra-specific variation in phenological effects was identified. This meant that an 'average behaviour' had to be derived which reduced the predictive capability of the derived stomatal flux model (R <sup>2</sup> = 0.49, P < 0.001, 15 cultivars included). Indeed, given the intra-specific variability encountered, the flux model that was derived from the full dataset was no better in predicting O<sub>3</sub> impacts on wheat yield than was the AOT40 index. The study highlights the need to use ozone risk assessment tools appropriate to specific vegetation types when modelling and mapping ozone impacts at the regional level.

We investigated how elevated concentrations of CO2 and O3, alone and in combination, affected the accumulated stomatal flux of O3 (AFst) by canopies and sun leaves in closed aspen and aspen-birch forests in the free-air CO2?O3 enrichment experiment near Rhinelander, Wisconsin. Stomatal conductance for O3  was derived from sap flux data and AFst was estimated either neglecting or accounting for the potential influence of non-stomatal leaf surface O3 deposition. Leaf-level AFst (AFstl) was not reduced by elevated CO2. Instead, there was a significant CO2 ? O3 interaction on AFstl, as a consequence of lower values of gs in control plots and the combination treatment than in the two single-gas treatments. In addition, aspen leaves had higher AFstl than birch leaves, and estimates of AFstl were not very sensitive to non-stomatal leaf surface O3 deposition. Our results suggest that model projections of large CO2-induced reductions in gs alleviating the adverse effect of rising tropospheric O3 may not be reasonable for northern hardwood forests.

In this paper, we suggest organizing the bar chart according to drivers of change-that is, by economic sector. Climate impacts of tropospheric ozone, fine aerosols, aerosol-cloud interactions, methane, and long-lived greenhouse gases are considered. We quantify the future evolution of the total radiative forcing due to perpetual constant year 2000 emissions by sector, most relevant for the development of climate policy now, and focus on two specific time points, near-term at 2020 and long-term at 2100.

Specifically, we tested the effect of UVB on the susceptibility of Cascades frog (Rana cascadae) larvae to predation by rough-skinned newts (Taricha granulosa). We also further examined the sublethal effects of UVB on growth and development in Cascades frog larvae. We found no direct effect of UVB exposure on survival.

UVB also caused increased susceptibility to predation, but there was a significant treatment-block interaction. UVB increased susceptibility to predation in two out of five blocks of Cascades frogs.

The comparison highlights the importance of several physical processes in determining radiative forcing, especially the effect of climate change on stratosphere- troposphere exchange, heterogeneous sulfate-nitrate-dust chemistry, and changes in methane oxidation and natural emissions. However, the impact of these fairly uncertain physical effects is substantially less than the difference between alternative emission scenarios for all short- lived species. The net global mean annual average direct radiative forcing from the short-lived species is.02 W/m(2) or less in our projections, as substantial positive ozone forcing is largely offset by negative aerosol direct forcing. Since aerosol reductions also lead to a reduced indirect effect, the global mean surface temperature warms by similar to 0.07 degrees C by 2030 and similar to 0.13 degrees C by 2050, adding 19% and 17%, respectively, to the warming induced by long-lived greenhouse gases. Regional direct forcings are large, up to 3.8 W/m(2).

The local mountain-valley wind system and the proximity of the Denver Metropolitan area leads to high summertime ozone episodes on many afternoons. The timing between these episodes and the ecosystem processes controlling photosynthesis during the growing season plays a critical role in determining the amount of ozone deposition. Light and vapor pressure deficit (VPD) were the most dominant environmental drivers controlling the deposition of O3 at this site through their influence on stomatal conductance. 81% of the daytime O3 uptake was predicted to occur through the stomata. Stomatal uptake decreased at high VPD and temperatures leading to an overall decrease in O3 flux; however, we did observe a non-stomatal conductance for O3 that increased slightly with temperature before leveling off at higher values. During the growing season, O3 deposition fluxes were enhanced after midday precipitation events and continued at elevated levels throughout the following night, implying a role for surface wetness. From nighttime data, evidence for both the presence of water films on the needles and non-closure of the plant stomata were observed. During the winter (non-growing) season, the ozone deposition velocity showed a consistent dependency on the latent heat flux.

The study was conducted during two growing seasons, when steady-state leaf area index (L) had been reached after > 6 years of exposure to CO2- and O-3-enrichment treatments. Canopy conductance (g(c)) was estimated from stand sap flux, while leaf-level conductance of sun leaves in the upper canopy was derived by three different and independent methods: sap flux and L in combination with vertical canopy modelling, leaf C-13 discrimination methodology in combination with photosynthesis modelling and leaf-level gas exchange. Regardless of the method used, the mean values of leaf-level conductance were higher in trees growing under elevated CO2 and/or O-3 than in trees growing in control plots, causing a CO2 x O-3 interaction that was statistically significant (P <= 0.10) for sap flux-and (for birch) C-13-derived leaf conductance.

CO2 is the substrate for photosynthesis and thus can accelerate tree growth, whereas O-3 is a highly reactive oxygen species and interferes with basic physiological functions. This review summarizes the impacts of CO2 and O-3 on tree chemical composition and highlights the consequences thereof for trophic interactions and ecosystem dynamics. CO2 and O-3 influence phytochemical composition by altering substrate availability and biochemical/physiological processes such as photosynthesis and defense signaling pathways. Growth of trees under enriched CO2 generally leads to an increase in the C/N ratio, due to a decline in foliar nitrogen and concomitant increases in carbohydrates and phenolics. Terpenoid levels generally are not affected by atmospheric CO2 concentration. O-3 triggers up-regulation of antioxidant defense pathways, leading to the production of simple phenolics and flavonoids (more so in angiosperms than gymnosperms). Tannins levels generally are unaffected, while terpenoids exhibit variable responses. In combination, CO2 and O-3 exert both additive and interactive effects on tree chemical composition. CO2-and O-3-mediated changes in plant chemistry influence host selection, individual performance (development, growth, reproduction), and population densities of herbivores (primarily phytophagous insects) and soil invertebrates. These changes can effect shifts in the amount and temporal pattern of forest canopy damage and organic substrate deposition. Decomposition rates of leaf litter produced under elevated CO2 and O-3 may or may not be altered, and can respond to both the independent and interactive effects of the pollutants. Overall, however, CO2 and O-3 effects on decomposition will be influenced more by their impacts on the quantity, rather than quality, of litter produced. A prominent theme to emerge from this and related reviews is that the effects of elevated CO2 and O-3 on plant chemistry and ecological interactions are highly context- and species-specific, thus frustrating attempts to identify general, global patterns. Many of the interactions that govern above- and below-ground community and ecosystem processes are chemically mediated, ultimately influencing terrestrial carbon sequestration and feeding back to influence atmospheric composition. Thus, the discipline of chemical ecology is fundamentally important for elucidating the impacts of humans on the health and sustainability of forest ecosystems. Future research should seek to increase the diversity of natural products, species, and biomes studied; incorporate long-term, multi-factor experiments; and employ a comprehensive """"genes to ecosystems"""" perspective that couples genetic/genomic tools with the approaches of evolutionary and ecosystem ecology.""",9.4.9.1,Insects,0,0

Elevated CO2 decreased the water concentration in both short- and long-shoot leaves, but the effect of CO2 on the concentration of nitrogen and individual phenolic compounds was mediated by O-3 treatment, tree genotype and leaf type. Elevated O-3 increased the total carbon concentration only in short-shoot leaves. Bioassays showed that elevated CO2 increased the food consumption rate of juvenile Epirrita autumnata and Rheumaptera hastata larvae fed with short- and long-shoot leaves in spring and mid-summer, respectively, but had no effect on the growth of larvae. The contribution of leaf quality variables to the observed CO2 effects indicate that insect compensatory consumption may be related to leaf age. Elevated CO2 increased the food preference of only two tested species: Phyllobius argentatus (CO2 alone) and R. hastata (CO2 combined with O-3). The observed stimulus was dependent on tree genotype and the measured leaf quality variables explained only a portion of the stimulus. Elevated O-3 decreased the growth of flush-feeding young E. autumnata larvae, irrespective of CO2 concentration, apparently via reductions in general food quality. Therefore, the increasing tropospheric O-3 concentration could pose a health risk for juvenile early-season birch folivores in future.

O-3 concentrations in the lower atmosphere (troposphere) are predicted to continue increasing as a result of anthropogenic activity, which will impact strongly on wild and cultivated plants. O-3 affects photosynthesis and induces the development of visible foliar injuries, which are the result of genetically controlled programmed cell death. It also activates many plant defense responses, including the emission of phytogenic VOCs. Plant emitted VOCs play a role in many eco-physiological functions. Besides protecting the plant from abiotic stresses (high temperatures and oxidative stress) and biotic stressors (competing plants, micro- and macroorganisms), they drive multitrophic interactions between plants, herbivores and their natural enemies e.g., predators and parasitoids as well as interactions between plants (plant-to-plant communication).

Tadpoles were exposed to environmentally relevant levels of OP (0.01 or 10 nM), with and without exposure to UVBR (??E?A?0.22 W/m2). After 8 mo of exposure, animals were transferred to a clean-water grow-out system for 3 additional mo. There was no effect of treatments on the weights of animals at wk 42 or on the age, snout-vent length (SVL), and weights of tadpoles at forelimb emergence (FLE). However, tadpoles exposed to UVBR had markedly delayed development and significantly fewer reached metamorphosis compared to control animals. Although exposure to UVBR and OP together produced the highest incidence of mortality and developmental anomalies, UVBR alone was sufficient to produce significant mortality of tadpoles, and exposure to UVBR or OP alone induced a significant increase in malformations and abnormalities. The malformations observed consisted mainly of spinal curvature. Our results show that chronic exposure to environmental levels of UVBR or OP alone exerts lethal and/or sublethal effects on R. pipiens tadpoles.

Altogether 30 study plots, each 120 cm x120 cm in size, were randomly distributed between three treatments (n = 10): ambient control, UV-A control and UV-B treatment. The UV-B-treated plots were exposed to elevated UV-B radiation level for three growing seasons. The instantaneous net ecosystem CO2 exchange (NEE) and dark respiration (RTOT) were measured during the growing season using a closed chamber method. The wintertime CO2 emissions were estimated using a gradient technique by analyzing the CO2 concentration in the snow pack. In addition to the instantaneous CO2 exchange, the seasonal CO2 balances during the growing seasons were modeled using environmental data measured at the site. In general, the instantaneous NEE at light saturation was slightly higher in the UV-B treatment compared with the ambient control, but the gross photosynthesis was unaffected by the exposure. The RTOT was significantly lower under elevated UV-B in the third study year. The modeled seasonal (June-September) CO2 balance varied between the years depending on the ground water level and temperature conditions. During the driest year, the seasonal CO2 balance was negative (net release of CO2) in the ambient control and the UV-B treatment was CO2 neutral. During the third year, the seasonal CO2 uptake was 43 ? 36 g CO2-C m-2 in the ambient control and 79 ? 45 g CO2-C m-2 in the UV-B treatment. The results suggest that the long-term exposure to high UV-B radiation levels may slightly increase the CO2 accumulation to fens resulting from a decrease in microbial activity in peat. However, it is unlikely that the predicted development of the level of UV-B radiation would significantly affect the CO2 balance of fen ecosystems in future.",1.4.4,Ecosystem and Materials Damage Effects Due to UV B Radiation,0,0

The use of the most efficient simplified chemical scheme among three chemical mechanisms with different degrees of complexity is acceptable for global scale simulations of the radiative effects of tropospheric O/sub 3/ changes in the CCM, since the differences in the results are small. The CCM model with simplified chemistry is implemented to study various aspects of the impact of BB emissions on tropospheric O/sub 3/ and its RF. The backward emission model results are in good agreement with the present-day observations for regions downwind of BB sources, while the forward emission model may reasonably produce the distributions of regional emissions in the preindustrial period. The global mean RF due to tropospheric O/sub 3/ increase from 1890 to 1990 is 0.41 W m/sup -2/ on a global average. When no anthropogenic emissions in the preindustrial period are considered, this forcing reaches 0.47 W m/sup -2/. We find that the global mean BB forcing due to tropospheric O/sub 3/ changes from 1890 to 1990 is 0.15 W m/sup -2/ on a global average. The preindustrial BB emissions need to be represented realistically when evaluating controls on the emissions of trace gases and aerosols for a sustainable society, because there are significant open biomass burning emissions in the preindustrial period. The significant regional differences in the surface O/sub 3/ concentrations among three different BB data sets are found in the United States for 1890 and in Brazil for 1990. In these regions during the periods, the most common land uses in the forests are logging and conversion of primary or secondary forests to cattle pasture or shifting cultivation. Improvement in the data sets of historical land use changes and accurate representation of carbon dynamics are needed for improving the model calculation of biomass burning emissions.",1.3.4,Competing Effects of O3 Precursors on Climate,0,0

The fish were exposed to 7, 20 or 60 mJ cm<sup>??E?a??2</sup> UVB three times per week, for 6 weeks. In carp, UVB exposure affected the respiratory burst activity of blood and head kidney phagocytes, differential blood leukocyte counts and blood chemistry. Phytohemagglutinin (PHA)-stimulated in vitro proliferation responses of blood and head kidney lymphocytes, however, remained unchanged. Rainbow trout tolerated the irradiations with fewer alterations, but significant changes were detected in blood chemistry and hematocrits of the irradiated fish. These results indicate that long-term exposure to low doses of UVB induces immunomodulation in fish, and that there are species-specific differences in sensitivity to irradiation.

Aerosols simulated include sulfates, organic matter ( OM), black carbon ( BC), sea-salt and dust and, additionally, the amount of tropospheric ozone is calculated, allowing us to estimate both changes to air quality and climate for different time periods and emission amounts. We include both the direct aerosol effect and indirect aerosol effects for liquid-phase clouds. Future changes for the 2030 A1B scenario are examined, focusing on the Arctic and Asia, since changes are pronounced in these regions. Our results for the different time periods include both emission changes and physical climate changes. We find that the aerosol indirect effect ( AIE) has a large impact on photochemical processing, decreasing ozone amount and ozone forcing, especially for the future ( 2030-1995). Ozone forcings increase from 0 to 0.12 W m(-2) and the total aerosol forcing decreases from -0.10 to -0.94W m(-2) ( AIE decreases from -0.13 to -0.68W m(-2)) for 1995-1980 versus 2030-1995. Over the Arctic we find that compared to ozone and the direct aerosol effect, the AIE contributes the most to net radiative flux changes. The AIE, calculated for 1995-1980, is positive (1.0 W m(-2)), but the magnitude decreases (-0.3Wm(-2)) considerably for the future scenario. Over Asia, we evaluate the role of biofuel- and transportation- based emissions ( for BC and OM) via a scenario ( 2030A) that includes a projected increase ( factor of 2) in biofuel- and transport-based emissions for 2030 A1B over Asia. Projected changes from present day due to the 2030A emissions versus 2030 A1B are a factor of 4 decrease in summertime precipitation in Asia. Our results are sensitive to emissions used.

We addressed the impact of doubling background O-3 on the host location of the parasitoid Cotesia plutellae by conducting 24-h trials in an open-air O-3-fumigation system during two consecutive years. Two circles (radii 1.40 and 4.00 m) of Plutella xylostella-infested potted cabbage plants were placed in the O-3 and ambient plots. Female wasps were released into each plot from the center, and observed 5 times over a 24-h period to assess their host location capability. Thereafter, plants were kept in laboratory conditions until larvae pupation to determine parasitism rates. No significant differences were detected between ambient and O-3-enriched environments either in the number of wasps found in the field, or in the percentages of parasitized larvae. This suggests that moderately elevated O-3 will not affect the behavior of this parasitoid. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

The observed increase of similar to 1 ppbv yr(-1) in the mean ozone level was statistically significant. We also found that the probability distribution of the springtime ozone mixing ratios was substantially modified, with the ozone mixing ratios greatly increasing at the upper end of the probability distribution. This increase has been Particularly large since 2003, with larger increases occurring at the higher percentiles, The number of high-ozone days doubled during 2003-2006 compared to 1999-2002.

We analyze the effect of interstate transport on surface O-3 in each continental U.S. state in July 1996 using the community multiscale air quality (CMAQ) model. By examining the difference between a baseline simulation and perturbabon simulations in which each state's nitrogen oxides (NOx) emissions are removed, we establish for the first time a summertime source-receptor matrix for all 48 continental states. We find that for 16 (20) states at least one neighboring state's NO, emissions are responsible for a larger increase in monthly mean peak 8 h (all-hour) O-3 concentrations than the state's own emissions. For over 80% of the contiguous states, interstate transport is more important than local emissions for summertime peak O-3 concentrations. Our source-receptor matrices indicate that the geographic range of the clean air interstate rule (CAIR) was sufficient to address interstate transport of O-3 in most of the states included in the program.

We first examine the sensitivity of surface O3 concentrations (O3srf) and net radiative forcing of climate (RFnet) to reductions in emissions of four precursors ? nitrogen oxides (NOx), non?methane volatile organic compounds, carbon monoxide, and methane (CH4). We show that long?term CH4?induced changes in O3, known to be important for climate, are also relevant for air quality; for example, NOx reductions increase CH4, causing a long?term O3 increase that partially counteracts the direct O3 decrease. Second, we assess the radiative forcing resulting from actions to improve O3 air quality by calculating the ratio of ?RFnet to changes in metrics of O3srf. Decreases in CH4 emissions cause the greatest RFnet decrease per unit reduction in O3srf, while NOx reductions increase RFnet. Of the available means to improve O3 air quality, therefore, CH4 abatement best reduces climate forcing.",1.3.4,Competing Effects of O3 Precursors on Climate,0,0

Classic injury symptoms on well-known bioindicator plants strongly supported the presumption that symptoms were caused by photochemical oxidants, of which ozone (O3) is the primary pollutant. Symptoms in indicator plants characteristic of injury caused by peroxyacetyl nitrate (PAN), ethylene, and sulfur dioxide (SO2) were also reported (de Bauer 1972; de Bauer and Hernandez-Tejeda 1986). These discoveries were followed in 1976 by the observation of O3 injury symptoms in native pine species in forests in Ajusco (AJ), just south of Mexico City (de Bauer and Hernandez-Tejeda 1986; Krupa and de Bauer 1976). Then in the 1980s, a dramatic and severe decline occurred in sacred fir (Abies religiosa) stands in the highly polluted area of the Desierto de los Leones (DL) National Park southwest of Mexico City (Alvarado-Rosales and Hernandez-Tejeda 2002). Thousands of trees died, leaving dead zones called cemeteries. Air pollution was widely believed to be an important causal factor in the widespread mortality of sacred fir within the park (Ciesla and Macias-Samano 1987). Topographic conditions, including volcanic mountain ranges circumscribing much of the Basin, thermal atmospheric inversions, and prevailing winds which carry pollutants from the urban zone to forested areas to the south-southwest (SSW), create conditions favoring high pollution exposure for these forests (Bravo and Torres 2002; Jauregui 2002).",9.4.7.1,Forest,8.2,Visible Foliar Injury and Biomonitoring

The ""constant"" of proportionality is a measure of the overall strength of climate feedback processes and hence of global climate sensitivity. Geographically, however, temperature response patterns are generally not proportional to, nor do they resemble, their parent forcing patterns. Temperature response patterns, nevertheless, exhibit a remarkable additivity whereby the sum of response patterns for different forcings closely resembles the response pattern for the sum of the forcings. 

The geographical distribution of contributions to the climate sensitivity/feedback are obtained diagnostically from simulations with the Canadian Centre for Climate Modelling and Analysis (CCCma) coupled global climate model (GCM). There is positive feedback over high-latitude oceans, over northern land areas, and over the equatorial Pacific. The remaining regions over oceans and tropical land areas exhibit negative feedback. The feedback results are decomposed into components associated with short-and longwave radiative processes and in terms of cloud-free atmosphere/surface and cloud feedbacks. While the geographic pattern of the feedbacks may generally be linked to local processes, all feedback processes display regions of both positive and negative values (except for the solar atmosphere/surface feedback associated with the retreat of ice and snow which is positive) and all vary from place to place so that there is no simple physical picture that operates everywhere. The stable geographical pattern of the feedback is a consequence of the balance between local physical processes rather than the dominance of a particular process.

The feedback results indicate that, to first order, temperature response patterns are determined by the geographical pattern of local feedback processes. The feedback processes act to localize forcing changes and to generate temperature response patterns which depend firstly on the pattern of feedbacks and only secondarily on the pattern of the forcing. The geographical distribution of feedback processes can be regarded as a feature of the climate model (and by inference of the climate system) and not (or only comparatively weak) functions of forcing and climate state. An illustrative model is able to reproduce qualitatively the kinds of forcing/temperature response behavior seen in the CCCma GCM including the quasi-independence of forcing and response patterns, the additivity of temperature response patterns, and the resulting ""non-constancy"" of the global climate sensitivity.",1.3.3.4,Feedback Factors that Alter the Climate Response to Changes in O3 Radiative Forcing,0,0

Concentrations of sulfate, nitrate, primary organic carbon (POA), secondary organic carbon (SOA), black carbon (BC) aerosols, and tropospheric O3 for the years 1950 and 2000 are obtained a priori by coupled chemistry-aerosol-GCM simulations, and then monthly concentrations are interpolated linearly between 1951 and 2000.

Aerosols and tropospheric ozone (O3) are expected to induce significant perturbations to the GHG-forced climate. To distinguish the equilibrium climate responses to changes in direct radiative forcing of anthropogenic aerosols, tropospheric ozone, and GHG between present day and year 2100, four 80-year equilibrium climates are simulated using a unified tropospheric chemistry-aerosol model within the Goddard Institute for Space Studies (GISS) general circulation model (GCM) II?. Concentrations of sulfate, nitrate, primary organic (POA) carbon, secondary organic (SOA) carbon, black carbon (BC) aerosols, and tropospheric ozone for present day and year 2100 are obtained a priori by coupled chemistry-aerosol GCM simulations, with emissions of aerosols, ozone, and precursors based on the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Special Report on Emissions Scenario (SRES) A2. Changing anthropogenic aerosols, tropospheric ozone, and GHG from present day to year 2100 is predicted to perturb the global annual mean radiative forcing by +0.18 (considering aerosol direct effects only), +0.65, and +6.54 W m?2 at the tropopause, and to induce an equilibrium global annual mean surface temperature change of +0.14, +0.32, and +5.31 K, respectively, with the largest temperature response occurring at northern high latitudes. Anthropogenic aerosols, through their direct effect, are predicted to alter the Hadley circulation owing to an increasing interhemispheric temperature gradient, leading to changes in tropical precipitation. When changes in both aerosols and tropospheric ozone are considered, the predicted patterns of change in global circulation and the hydrological cycle are similar to those induced by aerosols alone. GHG-induced climate changes, such as amplified warming over high latitudes, weakened Hadley circulation, and increasing precipitation over the Tropics and high latitudes, are consistent with predictions of a number of previous GCM studies.

to 30 km) by a variety of seven chemistry-climate models and three chemical transport models. The modeled ozone changes are taken as input for detailed calculations of radiative forcing.
When only changes in chemistry are considered (constant climate) the modeled global-mean tropospheric ozone column increase since preindustrial times ranges from 7.9DU to 13.8DU among the ten participating models, while the stratospheric column reduction lies between 14.1DU and 28.6DU in the models considering stratospheric chemistry. The resulting radiative forcing is strongly dependent on the
location and altitude of the modeled ozone change and varies between 0.25Wm?2 and 0.45Wm?2 due to ozone change in the troposphere and ?0.123Wm?2 and +0.066Wm?2 due to the stratospheric ozone change.
Changes in ozone and other greenhouse gases since preindustrial
times have altered climate. Six out of the ten participating models have performed an additional calculation taking into account both chemical and climate change. In most models the isolated effect of climate change is an enhancement of the tropospheric ozone column increase, while the  stratospheric reduction becomes slightly less severe. In the
three climate-chemistry models with detailed tropospheric and stratospheric chemistry the inclusion of climate change increases the resulting radiative forcing due to tropospheric ozone change by up to 0.10Wm?2, while the radiative forcing due to stratospheric ozone change is reduced by up to 0.034Wm?2.

As the concentrations of other greenhouse gases, particularly carbon dioxide, increase because of human activity, it is centrally important to predict how the water vapor distribution will be affected. To the extent that water vapor concentrations increase in a warmer world, the climatic effects of the other greenhouse gases will be amplified. Models of the Earth's climate indicate that this is an important positive feedback that increases the sensitivity of surface temperatures to carbon dioxide by nearly a factor of two when considered in isolation from other feedbacks, and possibly by as much as a factor of three or more when interactions with other feedbacks are considered. Critics of this consensus have attempted to provide reasons why modeling results are overestimating the strength of this feedback.

Our uncertainty concerning climate sensitivity is disturbing. The range most often quoted for the equilibrium global mean surface temperature response to a doubling of CO2 concentrations in the atmosphere is 1.5?C to 4.5?C. If the Earth lies near the upper bound of this sensitivity range, climate changes in the twenty-first century will be profound. The range in sensitivity is primarily due to differing assumptions about how the Earth's cloud distribution is maintained; all the models on which these estimates are based possess strong water vapor feedback. If this feedback is, in fact, substantially weaker than predicted in current models, sensitivities in the upper half of this range would be much less likely, a conclusion that would clearly have important policy implications. In this review, we describe the background behind the prevailing view on water vapor feedback and some of the arguments raised by its critics, and attempt to explain why these arguments have not modified the consensus within the climate research community.",1.3.2.2,Projections of Future Climate Change,0,0

While ice-albedo feedback is likely to account for much of the polar amplification, the strength of the feedback depends on numerous physical processes

high-latitude warming in the models. In particular, the latitude of the maximum warming is correlated inversely and significantly with sea-ice extent in the control climate. Additionally, models with relatively thin Arctic ice cover in the control climate tend to have higher polar amplification. An intercomparison of model results also shows that increases in poleward
ocean heat transport at high latitudes and increases in polar cloud cover are significantly correlated to amplified Arctic warming.

Current and future climate model simulations were run, in which anthropogenic emission changes affected climate, which fed back to natural emissions from lightning (NO, NO2, HONO, HNO3, N2O, H2O2, HO2, CO), soils (dust, bacteria, NO, N2O, H2, CH4, H2S, DMS, OCS, CS2), the ocean (bacteria, sea spray, DMS, N2O, H2, CH4), vegetation (pollen, spores, isoprene, monoterpenes, methanol, other VOCs), and photosynthesis/respiration. New methods were derived to calculate lightning flash rates as a function of size?resolved collisions and other physical principles and pollen, spore, and bacteria emissions. Although the B1 scenario was ?cleaner? than the A1B scenario, global warming increased more in the B1 scenario because much A1B warming was masked by additional reflective aerosol particles. Thus neither scenario is entirely beneficial from a climate and health perspective, and the best control measure is to reduce warming gases and warming/cooling particles together. Lightning emissions declined by ~3% in the B1 scenario and ~12% in the A1B scenario as the number of ice crystals, thus charge?separating bounceoffs, decreased. Net primary production increased by ~2% in both scenarios. Emissions of isoprene and monoterpenes increased by ~1% in the A1B scenario and 4?5% in the B1 scenario. Near?surface ozone increased by ~14% in the A1B scenario and ~4% in the B1 scenario, reducing ambient isoprene in the latter case.

The observed ozone trends at many European sites are only partially reproduced by global or regional photochemistry models, and possible reasons for this are discussed. The increase in winter ozone partially and the decrease in the magnitude of high ozone episodes is attributed to the decrease in ozone precursor emissions since 1990 by the model.

Thinner ice amplifies the atmospheric temperature sensitivity in these experiments by about 15% (to a warming of 4.8?C), because it is easier for the thinner ice to be removed as the climate warms. Thus, its impact on sensitivity is similar to that of greater sea ice extent in the control run, which provides more opportunity for sea ice reduction. An experiment with sea ice not allowed to change between the control and doubled CO2 simulations illustrates that the total effect of sea ice on surface air temperature changes, including cloud cover and water vapor feedbacks that arise in response to sea ice variations, amounts to 37% of the temperature sensitivity to the CO2 doubling, accounting for 1.56?C of the 4.17?C global warming. This is about four times larger than the sea ice impact when no feedbacks are allowed. The different experiments produce a range of results for southern high latitudes with the hydrologic budget over Antarctica implying sea level increases of varying magnitude or no change.

Ozone in regionally polluted air masses shows a broad maximum in spring and summer and a minimum in winter, whereas ozone in other air masses shows a maximum in spring and minimum in summer at Tsukuba, Kagoshima, and Naha. The wintertime ozone in regionally polluted air masses is highest but summertime ozone is lowest at Naha among all other sites. In the lower troposphere the air masses from southern China also show much lower ozone levels in summer than from the northern part (up to 36 ppbv in August), which is suggested to be due to the additional influence of an Asian monsoon over southern China. Ozone levels at Sapporo are determined mainly by Eurasian air masses and show a broad maximum in spring and summer. The boundary layer ozone levels in the regionally polluted air masses are 10?12 ppbv higher throughout the year than in the Eurasian air masses, and in winter they are about 8 ppbv higher than over Europe.

Ozone levels in the regionally polluted air masses increased by 11?20% (5?11 ppbv) from 1970s to 1990s over Japan, and this is attributed to the large increase in NOx emissions over China in the 1990s.

Using the spatial and temporal distribution of precursor emissions, we simulated tropospheric ozone from 1890 to 1990 using the NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies (GISS) chemistry model. Archived three-dimensional ozone fields were then used in transient GISS climate model simulations. This enables more realistic evaluation of the impact of tropospheric ozone increases than prior simulations using an interpolation between preindustrial and present-day ozone. We find that tropospheric ozone contributed to the greater 20th-century warming in the Northern Hemisphere extratropics compared with the tropics and in the tropics compared with the Southern Hemisphere extratropics. Additionally, ozone increased more rapidly during the latter half of the century than the former, causing more rapid warming during that time. This is especially apparent in the tropics and is consistent with observations, which do not show similar behavior in the extratropics. Other climate forcings do not substantially accelerate warming rates in the tropics relative to other regions. This suggests that accelerated tropospheric ozone increases related to industrialization in the developing world have contributed to the accelerated tropical warming. During boreal summer, tropospheric ozone causes enhanced warming (>0.5?C) over polluted northern continental regions. Finally, the Arctic climate response to tropospheric ozone increases is large during fall, winter, and spring when ozone's lifetime is comparatively long and pollution transported from midlatitudes is abundant. The model indicates that tropospheric ozone could have contributed about 0.3?C annual average and about 0.4?C?0.5?C during winter and spring to the 20th-century Arctic warming. Pollution controls could thus substantially reduce the rapid rate of Arctic warming. ",1.3.3.2,The Effect of Surface Albedo on O3 Radiative Forcing,9.1.1,Summary from the 213 Ozone ISA

Water vapor is found to provide the largest positive feedback in all models and its strength is consistent with that expected from constant relative humidity changes in the water vapor mixing ratio. The feedbacks from clouds and surface albedo are also found to be positive in all models, while the only stabilizing (negative) feedback comes from the temperature response. Large intermodel differences in the lapse rate feedback are observed and shown to be associated with differing regional patterns of surface warming. Consistent with previous studies, it is found that the vertical changes in temperature and water vapor are tightly coupled in all models and, importantly, demonstrate that intermodel differences in the sum of lapse rate and water vapor feedbacks are small. In contrast, intermodel differences in cloud feedback are found to provide the largest source of uncertainty in current predictions of climate sensitivity.",1.3.2.2,Projections of Future Climate Change,0,0

Previous analyses of ozone trends over Canada have shown strong negative trends in tropospheric ozone. We present here a new analysis of trends in the vertical distribution of ozone with data up to the end of 2001. In addition, more detailed attention is paid to some potential sources of bias: total ozone correction, background current correction, and time-of-launch (diurnal) variation. For the 1980?2001 period the overall linear trends are primarily negative, both in tropospheric and stratospheric ozone. However, when the data for 1991?2001 only are considered, the trends are positive, even in the lower stratosphere. When the time series are compared with previously reported trends (to 1993), it is evident that ozone has rebounded at all levels below about 63 hPa. These differences do not appear to be related to changes in tropopause height, as the average height of the tropopause (as measured over the ozonesonde stations) has not changed over either the 22-year or the 11-year period. Nevertheless, comparison with another dynamical indicator, the wintertime frequency of occurrence of laminae in the ozone profile, suggests that this rebound may be partly a result of small changes in the atmospheric circulation, rather than a recovery of the ozone layer from halocarbon-induced depletion. The long-term trends in average tropospheric ozone concentrations over Canada are similar to corresponding lower stratospheric trends, and tropospheric ozone levels show significant correlation with lower stratospheric ozone amounts.

Evaluation of the TTO time series for 1979?1990 and 1997?1998 is presented here; it is limited to the few tropical ozonesonde stations operational during those years (Ascension Island; Natal, Brazil; Brazzaville). The standard deviation of the differences between TTO and the sondes is ?(6?7) Dobson units (DU), depending on location. Stratospheric column ozone, which is also derived by the modifiedresidual method, compares favorably with sondes (to within 6?9 DU) and with stratospheric ozone inferred from other satellites (usually 8?15 DU lower than the latter). TTO time series and the magnitude of the tropospheric wave-one pattern show El Ni?o-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) signals during the period from 1979?1992. During 1997 the ENSO stands out at some stations, but not at others. Between 12?N and 12?S, zonally averaged TTO shows no significant trend from 1980?1990. Trends are also not significant during this period in localized regions, for example, from just west of South America across to southern Africa. This is consistent with the ozonesonde record at Natal, Brazil (the only tropical ozone data publicly available for the 1980s), which shows no significant trend.

At 2030 the net forcings from O3, sulfate, black and organic carbon, and indirect CH4 effects for each emission sector are (in mWm?2) biomass burning, +95; domestic, +68; transportation, +67; industry, ?131; and power, ?224. Biomass burning emissions in East Asia and central and southern Africa, domestic biofuel emissions in East Asia, south Asia, and central and southern Africa, and transportation emissions in Europe and North America have large net positive forcings and are therefore attractive targets to counter global warming. Power and industry emissions from East Asia, south Asia, and north Africa and the Middle East have large net negative forcings. Therefore air quality control measures that affect these regional sectors require offsetting climate measures to avoid a warming impact. Linear relationships exist between O3 forcing and biomass burning and domestic biofuel CO precursor emissions independent of region with sensitivity of +0.2 mWm?2/TgCO.

The ozone amount in these layers is derived by first determining stratospheric column ozone in the Pacific from TOMS using deep convective clouds, which are numerous in the region. Tropospheric column ozone (TCO) for the Pacific is then determined by taking the difference between total column ozone and stratospheric column ozone. This ?cloud?slicing? technique is extensively tested from the tropics extending to ?60? latitude using stratospheric ozone data from the Stratospheric Aerosol and Gas Experiment II instrument. The validity of the cloud?slicing technique in obtaining TCO is also tested using data from ozonesondes over a wide range of latitude. SBUV ozone profiles are used to measure upper stratospheric column ozone for the Pacific region. Lower stratospheric column ozone is then derived from the difference between stratospheric column ozone and upper stratospheric column ozone. This process yields a unique 25?year record of Pacific mean ozone in three atmospheric layers covering all latitudes and seasons. The analysis of the data shows that the seasonal cycles, latitude dependence, and trends in these layers are substantially different. Over the 25?year record most ozone depletion has occurred in the lower stratosphere below ~25 km altitude. In middle and high latitudes, ozone losses are 3-4 times larger in the lower stratosphere compared with the upper stratosphere, even though the ozone amounts in the two regions are about the same.

We used extrafloral nectar (EFN) secretion as a phenotypic indicator of between-plant communication in Phaseolus lunatus L.

We found that ozone degrades several herbivore-induced VOCs, a likely mechanism reducing communication distances. Direct exposure to 80-ppb ozone did not affect the VOC emissions from P. lunatus. In addition, we demonstrated that high ozone concentrations, 120 and 160 ppb, induced EFN secretion in exposed plants, whereas more moderate concentrations, 80 and 100 ppb, did not.

Nonetheless, elevated CO2 decreased beetle performance on one aspen genotype and had inconsistent effects on beetles reared on two other genotypes. Elevated O3 decreased beetle performance, especially for beetles reared on an O3-sensitive genotype. Regression analyses indicated that phenolic glycosides and nitrogen explain a substantial amount (27?45%) of the variation in herbivore performance. By contrast to the negative effects that are typically observed with generalist herbivores, aspen leaf beetles appear to benefit from phenolic glycosides, chemical components that are largely genetically-determined in aspen.

Each chamber was randomly assigned one of three ozone treatments (0, 90 and 120 ppb episodic ozone). Sixty plant species from 22 families emerged in the chambers over the four year study. Seedling emergence was a highly sensitive period. High seedling mortality rates in the ozone treatments allowed more resistant individuals to persist. Communities not exposed to elevated ozone levels also had high rates of mortality probably due to density dependant mortality. No species were eliminated from the communities because of ozone. Plant species did not demonstrate ozone tolerance or susceptibility based on taxonomic relationships. Year-to-year environmental heterogeneity was a stronger influence on community composition than ozone exposures. At the community level, there was a trend of decreasing biomass with increasing ozone exposure. In the ozone treatments, premature senescence of taller species increased light availability to understory species, changing competitive interactions and altering community dynamics in the understory. The effects of ozone on individual species, both direct and indirect, in a community may be detrimental, insignificant, or positive. Predication of a species performance in a community will be difficult due to the many environmental and biological interactions occurring simultaneously or at alternative times during a specific species life cycle.

The present study examined the effects of elevated atmospheric CO2 and O3 on the invasive weevil Polydrusus sericeus Schaller at the Aspen Free Air CO2 Enrichment (FACE) site near Rhinelander, Wisconsin. A performance assay was conducted in the laboratory during the summer of 2007 using mated pairs of P. sericeus fed a combination of aspen, birch and maple foliage. We recorded leaf area consumption, oviposition and adult longevity. We also conducted visual abundance surveys in the field from 2004 to 2007 on aspen and birch at Aspen FACE. Elevated CO2, but not O3, significantly affected P. sericeus performance. Female, but not male, longevity was reduced under elevated CO2. Polydrusus sericeus also produced fewer eggs under elevated CO2 conditions compared with ambient conditions. Adult P. sericeus strongly preferred birch over both aspen and maple, regardless of fumigation treatment. The effects of elevated CO2 on P. sericeus populations at Aspen FACE were minimal, and varied among years and host tree species. Polydrusus sericeus abundance was significantly greater on birch than aspen. Over the long term, elevated CO2 may reduce adult female longevity and fecundity of P. sericeus.

645771,,,,Ecological effects of roads on amphibians and reptiles: A literature review,"Andrews, KM; Gibbons, JW; Jochimsen, DM",2008,"Roads are the ultimate manifestation of urbanization, providing an essential connectivity within and between rural and heavily populated areas. The ecological impacts roads have on herpetofauna across temporal and spatial scales are profound, beginning during the early stages of construction and progressing through to completion and daily use. We provide examples of physiological, ecological, and behavioral traits inherent among herpetofauna that enhance their susceptibility to habitat alterations and environmental changes that can result from the development as well as use of roads. We emphasize areas in which impacts on herpetofauna have not yet been documented, but are likely. We also identify potential threats to amphibians and reptiles by noting and discussing previous research in road ecology that is applicable. The most obvious impacts of roads are direct effects, which result in injury or death as a consequence of road construction followed by on-road mortality (roadkills) from contact with vehicles. In addition to the more measurable direct effects, road impacts are compounded further by a variety of indirect effects of roads on herpetofauna that can be pervasive through habitat fragmentation and alteration that extend to population and community level impacts. By identifying herpetofaunal susceptibilities and providing concrete examples of road impacts, we offer an ecological framework that can serve to suggest research questions and encourage investigators to pursue goals that relate to both direct and indirect effects of road development and subsequent urbanization on herpetofauna. Lastly, we present current and possible approaches for resolving and preventing conflicts between wildlife and roads.",9.4.9.2,Wildlife,0,0

The year 2100 CO2 concentration as well as the anthropogenic emissions of ozone precursors and aerosols/aerosol precursors are based on the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Special Report on Emissions Scenarios (SRES) A2. Year 2100 global O-3 and aerosol burdens predicted with changes in both climate and emissions are generally 5-20% lower than those simulated with changes in emissions alone; as exceptions, the nitrate burden is 38% lower, and the secondary organic aerosol burden is 17% higher. Although the CO2-driven climate change alone is predicted to reduce the global O-3 burden as a result of faster removal of O-3 in a warmer climate, it is predicted to increase surface layer O-3 concentrations over or near populated and biomass burning areas because of slower transport, enhanced biogenic hydrocarbon emissions, decomposition of peroxyacetyl nitrate at higher temperatures, and the increase of O-3 production by increased water vapor at high NOx levels. The warmer climate influences aerosol burdens by increasing aerosol wet deposition, altering climate-sensitive emissions, and shifting aerosol thermodynamic equilibrium.

We exposed five species of grass and oak litter collected from arid and mesic sites to a factorial design of ultraviolet (UV) radiation (UV pass, UV block), and sterilization under dry conditions in the laboratory. UV pass treatments produced 10 times the amount of CO2 produced in UV block treatments. CO2 production rates were unaffected by litter chemistry or sterilization. We also exposed litter to natural solar radiation outdoors on clear, sunny days close to the summer solstice at midlatitudes and found that UV radiation (280-400 nm) accounted for 55% of photochemically induced CO2 production, while shortwave visible radiation (400-500 nm) accounted for 45% of CO2 production. Rates of photochemically induced CO2 production on a per-unit-mass basis decreased with litter density, indicating that rates depend on litter surface area. We found no evidence for leaching, methane production, or facilitation of microbial decomposition as alternative mechanisms for significant photochemically induced C loss from litter. We conclude that abiotic mineralization to CO2 is the primary mechanism by which C is lost from litter during photodegradation. We estimate that CO2 production via photodegradation could be between 1 and 4 g C m(-2) a(-1) in arid ecosystems in the southwestern United States.

Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) UV RESISTANCE LOCUS8 (UVR8) is a recently identified UV-B-specific signaling component that regulates UV-protective responses. Using the uvr8 mutant, we defined genetically distinct UVR8-dependent and UVR8-independent pathways that stimulate different sets of genes in mature Arabidopsis leaf tissue. Both pathways operate at 1 micromol m(-2) s(-1) UV-B and above, but the UVR8-dependent pathway is able to stimulate UV-protective genes even in response to 0.1 micromol m(-2) s(-1) UV-B. Both pathways function in mutants lacking phytochromes, cryptochromes, or phototropins. Genes encoding the ELONGATED HYPOCOTYL5 (HY5) and HY5 HOMOLOG (HYH) transcription factors are induced at low UV-B fluence rates (0.1 micromol m(-2) s(-1)). Experiments with hy5 and hyh mutants reveal that both these factors mediate responses of the UVR8-dependent pathway, acting with partial or complete redundancy to stimulate expression of particular genes. Furthermore, evidence is presented that all UVR8 pathway genes are likely to be regulated by HY5/HYH and that these transcription factors do not mediate UV-B responses independent of UVR8. Finally, we highlight the functions of HY5 and HYH in UV protection and show that HY5 plays the more critical role.

However, contrasting results have also been published showing no effect on wheat biomass and grain yield. In addition, little is known about the effect of higher UV-B radiation at particular periods of the crop cycle on grain quality traits. The objective of the present study was to evaluate grain yield, yield components and grain quality in response to increased UV-B radiation during key periods of yield component determination. Two experiments were carried out under field conditions in the Universidad Austral de Chile (latitude 39 degrees 62'S). Two spring wheat cultivars were exposed to two periods of supplemented UV-B radiation (280-320 nm): (i) between booting and anthesis, c. 20 days, and (ii) from 10 days after anthesis until physiological maturity, c. 40 days. Ultraviolet radiation was increased to levels of 3.8 and 4.9 kJ/m(2)/day in experimental years 1 and 2, respectively, by using UV-B lamps. At harvest, plants were sampled to quantify aboveground biomass, grain yield, grain number and average grain weight. In addition, protein and gluten concentration of grains were measured. Grain yield was not affected (P>0-05) by the UV-B increase at pre- or at post-anthesis treatments. Similar results were found for each yield component. In addition, grain protein and gluten concentration showed similar values in the increased UV-B and control treatments.

The effects of UV-B (280-315 nm), which ate dependent on the stratospheric ozone layer, on biogeochemical cycles are often linked to concurrent exposure to UV-A radiation (315-400 nm), which is influenced by global climate change. These interactions involving UV radiation (the combination of UV-B and UV-A) are central to the prediction and evaluation of future Earth environmental conditions. There is increasing evidence that elevated UV-B radiation has significant effects on the terrestrial biosphere with implications for the cycling of carbon, nitrogen and other elements. The cycling of carbon and inorganic nutrients such as nitrogen can be affected by UV-B-mediated changes in communities of soil organisms, probably due to the effects of UV-B radiation on plant root exudation and/or the chemistry of dead plant material falling to the soil. In and environments direct photodegraclation can play a major role in the decay of plant litter, and UV-B radiation is responsible for a significant part of this photodegraclation. UV-B radiation strongly influences aquatic carbon, nitrogen, sulfur and metals cycling that affect a wide range of life processes. UV-B radiation changes the biological availability of dissolved organic matter to microorganisms, and accelerates its transformation into dissolved inorganic carbon and nitrogen, including carbon dioxide and ammonium. The coloured part of dissolved organic matter (CDOM) controls the penetration of UV radiation into water bodies, but CDOM is also photodegraded by solar UV radiation. Changes in CDOM influence the penetration of UV radiation into water bodies with major consequences for aquatic biogeochemical processes. Changes in aquatic primary productivity and decomposition due to climate-related changes in circulation and nutrient supply occur concurrently with exposure to increased UV-B radiation, and have synergistic effects on the penetration of light into aquatic: ecosystems. Future changes in climate will enhance stratification of lakes and the ocean, which will intensify photodegradation of CDOM by UV radiation. The resultant increase in the transparency of water bodies may increase UV-B effects on aquatic biogeochemistry in the surface layer. Changing solar UV radiation and climate also interact to influence exchanges of trace gases, such as halocarbons (e.g., methyl bromide) which influence ozone depletion, and sulfur gases (e.g., dimethylsulfide) that oxidize to produce sulfate aerosols that cool the marine atmosphere. UV radiation affects the biological availability of iron, copper and other trace metals in aquatic environments thus potentially affecting metal toxicity and the growth of phytoplankton and other microorganisms that are involved in carbon and nitrogen cycling. Future changes in ecosystem distribution due to alterations in the physical and chemical climate interact with ozone-modulated changes in UV-B radiation.

Primary productivity was measured in 12 h time-course experiments using enclosures that transmitted either full-spectrum solar UVR or only long-wavelength UVA. Recovery from inhibition was determined by transferring samples from high to low UVR at intervals during the incubation. Biological weighting functions for UVR inhibition of photosynthesis were also determined for each experiment. Photosynthesis measurements were compared to model predictions using 3 exposure-response relationships: an irradiance-based (E) model that assumes rapid repair, a cumulative-exposure (H) model that assumes no repair, and a model that incorporated slow repair (R model). Open-ocean phytoplankton were generally much more sensitive to UVR inhibition than coastal assemblages, which primarily had high rates of repair (E model). In contrast, open-ocean assemblages generally recovered from inhibition more slowly (R model). Some recovery was evident in all cases, so the Hmodel was not applied to any assemblage. Our previous view of repair being either simply present or absent is therefore revised to recognize that repair rates range from slow to fast and should be taken into account, together with spectral weight, in assessments of photosynthetic response to UVR in the Southern Ocean, including the effect of ozone depletion.

Exposure to UVR (UV-A 19.5 W m(-2), UV-B 0.67 W m(-2)) in addition to PAR (88.5 W m(-2)), however, results in significant inhibition of both photosynthesis and calcification, and these rates are further inhibited with increasing acidification.

This differential inhibition of calcification and photosynthesis leads to significant reduction of the ratio of calcification to photosynthesis. Seawater acidification enhanced the transmission of harmful UVR by about 26% through a reduction of the coccolith layer of 31%.

Over summer, mass loss from grass and forb litter exposed to ambient sunlight ranged from 8% to 10%, whereas lignin decreased in grass litter by approximately 20%. After one year of decomposition, mass losses from grass leaves exposed to sunlight over summer were more than double the mass losses from summer-shaded leaves. When shade litter layer thickness was varied, mass losses over summer for all treatments were also approximately 8%; however, lignin decreased significantly only in the low shade treatments (0-64 g m(-2) of shade litter).

The estimated proportion of grass litter lignin experiencing full photodegradation ranged from 100% under ambient conditions to 31-62% in plots receiving the combined global change treatments. These results reveal an important role of sun exposure over summer in accelerating litter decomposition in these grasslands and provide evidence that future changes in the quantity of litter deposition may modulate the influence of photodegradation integrated across the litter layer.",1.4.4,Ecosystem and Materials Damage Effects Due to UV B Radiation,0,0

The three light treatments were (i) photosynthetically active radiation (PAR, 400-700 nm), (ii) PAR plus longer wavelength ultraviolet (PAR + UVA, 320-700 nm), and (iii) full-spectrum sunlight with both long and short wavelength ultraviolet included (PAR + UVA + UVB, 280-700 nm). Observations made at different times of the day and under both overcast and sunny skies allowed an assessment of PAR intensity on behaviour in addition to that of UVR. We quantified shade-seeking behaviour, feeding strikes, and agonistic interactions (approaches, chases, and nips) between individuals. Under higher PAR intensities, a greater proportion of juvenile coho tended to take cover under rocks. Shade-seeking behaviour increased significantly in the presence of UVR. Feeding and agonistic interactions were partially inhibited at higher PAR intensities and very significantly depressed by UVR. For all behaviours tested, the effects were mediated by UVA with no significant additional impacts from UVB. UVR-mediated effects on behaviour could have ecological consequences through influencing summer densities, density-dependent growth, and size-dependent winter and early marine survivals.",1.4.4,Ecosystem and Materials Damage Effects Due to UV B Radiation,0,0

However, molecular mechanisms underlying the light-dependent transcriptional activation of CsPHR were unknown. In order to understand spectroscopic aspects of the plant response, we investigated the wavelength-dependence (action spectra) of the light-dependent transcriptional activation of CsPHR. In both cucumber seedlings and transgenic Arabidopsis seedlings expressing reporter genes under the control of the CsPHR promoter, the action spectra exhibited the most predominant peak in the long-wavelength UVB waveband (around 310 nm). In addition, a 95-bp cis-acting region in the CsPHR promoter was identified to be essential for the UVB-driven transcriptional activation of CsPHR. Thus, we concluded that the photoperception of long-wavelength UVB by UVB photoreceptor(s) led to the induction of the CsPHR transcription via a conserved cis-acting element.",1.4.4,Ecosystem and Materials Damage Effects Due to UV B Radiation,0,0

Many effects of UV-B involve the differential regulation of gene expression. The response to UV-B depends on the nature of the UV-B treatment, the extent of adaptation and acclimation to UV-B, and interaction with other environmental factors. Responses to UV-B are mediated by both nonspecific signaling pathways, involving DNA damage, reactive oxygen species, and wound/defense signaling molecules, and UV-B-specific pathways that mediate photomorphogenic responses to low levels of UV-B. Importantly, photomorphogenic signaling stimulates the expression of genes involved in UV-protection and hence promotes plant survival in UV-B. Photomorphogenic UV-B signaling is mediated by the UV-B-specific component UV RESISTANCE LOCUS8 (UVR8). Both UVR8 and CONSTITUTIVE PHOTOMORPHOGENESIS1 (COP1) are required for UV-B-induced expression of the ELONGATED HYPOCOTYL5 (HY5) transcription factor, which plays a central role in the regulation of genes involved in photomorphogenic UV-B responses.",1.4.4,Ecosystem and Materials Damage Effects Due to UV B Radiation,0,0

As the UV-B dose increases with altitude, it has been suggested that high-altitude populations may have an increased tolerance to high levels of UV-B radiation as compared to lowland populations. We tested this hypothesis with the common frog (Rana temporaria) by comparing populations from nine altitudes (from 333 to 2450 in above sea level). Eggs collected in the field were used for laboratory experiments, i.e., exposed to high levels of artificial UV-B radiation. Eggs were reared at 14 +/- 2 degrees C and exposed to UV treatments until hatching. Embryonic developmental rates increased strongly and linearly with increasing altitude, suggesting a genetic capacity for faster development in highland than lowland eggs. Body length at hatching varied significantly with UV-B treatments, being lower when eggs developed under direct UV-B exposure. Body length at hatching also increased as the altitude of populations increased, but UV-B exposure times were shorter as altitude of population increased. However, the body length difference between exposed and non-exposed individuals in each population decreased as altitude of populations increased, suggesting a costly effect of UV exposure on growth. Type of UV exposure did not influence the mean rates of embryonic mortality and deformity, but both mortality and deformity rates increased as the altitude of populations increased (while UV-B exposure duration decreased). The effect of UV-B on body length at hatching, mortality, and deformities suggests that the sensitivity to UV-B varied among populations along the altitudinal gradient. These results are discussed in evolutionary terms, specifically the potential of R. temporaria high-altitude populations to develop local genetic adaptation to high levels of UV-B.

As UV increases with altitude and latitude, it is suggested that high altitude and latitude populations have evolved tolerance to high levels of UV. Using laboratory experiments, we tested the hypothesis that Rana temporaria populations from several altitudes (438-2,450 m above sea level) were adapted to UV by assessing the effects of artificial UV on embryos mortality rate, malformations, and body length at hatching. We also tested the protective role of the jelly surrounding the embryos. Without artificial UV exposure, hatching success decreased with altitude of the population. Malformation rates were low for all populations (mean 1.36%), and hatching size increased with altitude. The artificial UV (UV-B, UV-A, and visible) used was similar to the solar spectrum received at high altitude. Exposed embryos had performance similar to that of embryos without exposure: a decreased hatching success with altitude and a low malformation rate (mean 0.85%). However, hatching size did not vary with altitude, and UV-exposed embryos tended to be smaller at hatching than non-exposed embryos. Removal of the protective jelly envelope greatly decreased the performance of UV-exposed embryos: hatching success strongly decreased with altitude and embryos of the highest population (2,450 m asl) did not develop. Malformation reached 4.98%, without population differences, and hatching size of embryos without jelly was smaller than hatching size of non-manipulated embryos with no population effect. This study demonstrates that lowland jellyless embryos were less sensitive (i.e., exhibited a higher survival rate) than highland embryos and, on the other hand, that the jelly envelope was a more efficient protection for embryos in highland than in lowland populations. A trade-off hypothesis is presented to explain this difference in UV tolerance and protection among populations: in a harsh, highland environment (i.e., with a curtailed activity period), embryos have to invest in development and growth and, thus, embryo protection should be a female investment (via the jelly). In a lowland environment, embryonic growth and development are less constrained and embryos are able to invest and use protection or repair mechanisms inherited from their parents.",1.4.4,Ecosystem and Materials Damage Effects Due to UV B Radiation,0,0

We examined effects of irradiation of algal membrane fragments in various stages of decay, with emphasis on transfer of materials from solid to dissolved phase (photodissolution). After simulated solar irradiation for 24 h, up to several tens of percent of particulate organic matter converted to photodissolved organic matter (PDOM). Prior microbial decay enhanced PDOM production. PDOM had initially high C:N ratios, which decreased with irradiation time. Dissolved organic nitrogen dominated nitrogen photodissolution, followed by minor photoammonification and negligible nitrite plus nitrate production. Chromophoric particulate organic matter bleached at visible wavelengths and underwent dissolution, creation, and bleaching at ultraviolet (UV) wavelengths, resulting in net loss of color in particulates and net gain of largely UV-absorbing PDOM that also exhibited humic-type fluorescence. Solid phase proteinaceous material became less accessible to proteases after microbial decay but regained this accessibility upon irradiation. Irradiation under anoxic conditions roughly halved production of PDOM, including chromophores and humic fluorophores. Oxygen enhancement of these reactions, along with production of peroxides, implies a strong role for photosensitization. Pigments, unsaturated lipids, and tryptophan emerged as likely sources of reactive oxygen species. Lipid peroxides appeared as a reactive intermediate product. If these reactions in the ocean scale to pigment loss as found in our experiments, at least 5-15% of particulate organic matter could undergo photodissolution before settling in some planktonic environments. This photodissolution would enhance remineralization by photic zone microbial communities and thus upper ocean elemental recycling.",1.4.4,Ecosystem and Materials Damage Effects Due to UV B Radiation,0,0

We constructed an action spectrum of thrips responses to light by studying their behavioural reactions to monochromatic irradiation under confinement conditions. Thrips were maximally sensitive to wavelengths between 290 and 330 nm; human-visible wavelengths (lambda >or= 400 nm) failed to elicit any response. All but six ommatidia of the thrips compound eye were highly fluorescent when exposed to UV-A of wavelengths longer than 330 nm. We hypothesized that the fluorescent compound acts as an internal filter, preventing radiation with lambda > 330 nm from reaching the photoreceptor cells. Calculations based on the putative filter transmittance and a visual pigment template of lambda(max) = 360 nm produced a sensitivity spectrum that was strikingly similar to the action spectrum of UV-induced behavioural response. These results suggest that specific UV-B vision in thrips is achieved by a standard UV-A photoreceptor and a sharp cut-off internal filter that blocks longer UV wavelengths in the majority of the ommatidia.",1.4.4,Ecosystem and Materials Damage Effects Due to UV B Radiation,0,0

When given the choice, Planorbarius significantly avoids leaves that were infested by the mining beetle. Conversely, Lymnaea did not discriminate against mined leaves. 3. Intact Nuphar leaves block over 95% of incident ultraviolet radiation. Yet, ultraviolet transmission reaches almost 100% under beetle mining scars. These are several times wider than snail embryos. 4. When exposed to natural sunlight, Lymnaea embryos proved to be resistant to ambient ultraviolet, while Planorbarius embryos were rapidly killed. Thus, one selective advantage of Planorbarius discrimination against mined leaves when depositing its eggs could be the avoidance of ultraviolet radiation passing through mining scars. 5. Other mining-related modifications of the leaves, reduced area, decreased longevity, altered aufwuchs (i.e. biofilm and epibionts) are discussed but seem less relevant for the oviposition preference of Planorbarius. 6.

Absorption coefficients of the colored component of the dissolved organic carbon (DOC; colored dissolved organic matter [CDOM]) were 63 to 253 larger than particulate absorption coefficients in the UV region, indicating that CDOM controls UV penetration in the inshore coastal waters and reef tract. CDOM absorption coefficients (a(CDOM)) and DOC were highly correlated to diffuse attenuation coefficients (K-d) in the UV spectral region. Measurements using moored sensors showed that UV penetration at the reef tract in the Lower Keys varies significantly from day to day and diurnally. The diurnal variations were linked to tidal currents that transport CDOM over the reef tract. Summertime stratification of Case 1 bluewaters near the reef tract during periods of low wind resulted in higher temperatures and UV penetration than that observed during well-mixed conditions. This result suggests that higher UV exposure accompanying ocean warming during low-wind doldrums conditions significantly contributes to coral bleaching. Modeling results indicate that changes in underwater sunlight attenuation over the coral reefs can affect UV-induced deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) damage and inhibition of coral photosynthesis much more strongly than changes in the stratospheric ozone layer.",1.4.4,Ecosystem and Materials Damage Effects Due to UV B Radiation,0,0

Aims: To study the effect of increased irradiance of UV-B on the photosynthetic capability of silver birch (Betula pendula Roth.) seedlings. Methods: The seedlings were grown in a greenhouse in a substrate composed of birch forest top soil and sand, without additional supply of mineral nutrients. The increased daily integrated irradiance of UV-B (GPAS) was equivalent to 25% stratospheric ozone depletion under clear sky, and the treatment was started at seedling emergence. Leaf gas exchange was measured under saturating light conditions, and CO2-assimilation rate, stomatal conductance and intercellular CO2 concentration were computed. Initial and total activity of RuBisCO and the concentrations of RuBisCO, chlorophylls, and soluble protein were measured in the same leaf. Total nitrogen concentration was also measured, as well as carbon isotope discrimination. Results: None of the variables measured were affected by UV-B at either of the two sampling dates (58 d and 76 d after the beginning of the treatment) except for stomatal conductance (interaction with time only). Conclusions: Consequently, it is unlikely that significant damage to photosynthesis of silver birch seedlings will occur in a natural setting under current and projected changes in solar UV-B.",1.4.4,Ecosystem and Materials Damage Effects Due to UV B Radiation,0,0

A further area of highly interesting research emphasizes the importance of indirect UV radiation effects on plants, pathogens, herbivoics, soil microbes and ecosystem processes below the surface. Although photosynthesis of higher plants and mosses is seldom affected by enhanced or reduced UV-B radiation in most field studies, effects on growth and morphology (form) of higher plants and mosses are often manifested. This can lead to small reductions in shoot production and changes in the competitive balance of different species. Fungi and bacteria are generally more sensitive to damage by UV-B radiation than are higher plants. However, the species differ in their UV-B radiation sensitivity to damage, some being affected while others may be very tolerant. This can lead to changes in species composition of microbial communities with subsequent influences on processes such as litter decomposition. Changes in plant chemical composition are commonly reported due to UV-B manipulations (either enhancement or attenuation of UV-B in sunlight) and may lead to substantial reductions in consumption of plant tissues by insects. Although sunlight does not penetrate significantly into soils, the biomass and morphology of plant root systems of plants can be modified to a much greater degree than plant shoots. Root mass can exhibit sizeable declines with more UV-B. Also, UV-B-induced changes in soil microbial communities and biomass, as well as altered populations of small invertebrates have been reported and these changes have important implications for mineral nutrient cycling in the soil. Many new developments in understanding the underlying mechanisms mediating plant response to UV-B radiation have emerged. This new information is helpful in understanding common responses of plants to UV-B radiation, such as diminished growth, acclimation responses of plants to UV-B radiation and interactions of plants with consumer organisms such as insects and plant pathogens. The response to UV-B radiation involves both the initial stimulus by solar radiation and transmission of signals within the plants. Resulting changes in gene expression induced by these signals may have elements in common with those elicited by other environmental factors, and generate overlapping functional (including acclimation) responses. Concurrent responses of terrestrial systems to the combination of enhanced UV-B radiation and other global change factors (increased temperature, CO,, available nitrogen and altered precipitation) are less well understood. Studies of individual plant responses to combinations of factors indicate that plant growth can be augmented by higher CO, levels, yet many of the effects of UV-B radiation are usually not ameliorated by the elevated CO,. UV-B radiation often increases both plant frost tolerance and survival under extreme high temperature conditions. Conversely, extreme temperatures sometimes influence, the UV-B radiation sensitivity of plants directly. Plants that endure water deficit stress effectively are also likely to be tolerant of high UV-B flux. Biologically available nitrogen is exceeding historical levels in many regions due to human activities. Studies show that plants well supplied with nitrogen are generally more sensitive to UV-B radiation. Technical issues concerning the use of biological spectral weighting functions (BSWFs) have been further elucidated. The SWFs, which are multiplication factors assigned to different wavelengths giving an indication of their relative biological effectiveness, are critical to the proper conduct and interpretation of experiments in which organisms are exposed to UV radiation, both in. the field and in controlled environment facilities. The characteristics of BSWFs vary considerably among different plant processes, such as growth, DNA damage, oxidative damage and induction of changes in secondary chemicals. Thus, use of a single BSWF for plant or ecosystem response is not appropriate. This brief review emphasizes progress since the previous report toward the understanding of solar ultraviolet radiation effects on terrestrial systems as it relates to ozone column reduction and the interaction of climate change factors.",1.4.4,Ecosystem and Materials Damage Effects Due to UV B Radiation,0,0

In this study, alkali extraction of cell wall-bound phenolics, combined with methanol extraction of soluble phenolics, was used to determine whether cell wall-bound UV screens explain the greater UV tolerance of C. purpureus. The combined pool of UV screens was similar in B. pseudotriquetrum and C. purpureus, but whilst B. pseudotriquetrum had almost equal concentrations of MeOH-soluble and alkali-extractable cell wall-bound UV-screening compounds, in C. purpureus the concentration of cell wall-bound screening compounds was six times higher than the concentration of MeOH-soluble UV screens. The Antarctic endemic Schistidium antarctici possessed half the combined pool of UV screens of the other species but, as in C. purpureus, these were predominantly cell wall bound. Confocal microscopy confirmed the localization of UV screens in each species. Greater investment in cell wall-bound UV screens offers C. purpureus a more spatially uniform, and potentially more effective, UV screen.

Larval amphibians frequently experience simultaneous, conflicting selection pressures from ultraviolet-B (UV-B) radiation and predation risk, two stressors that can select for opposing defence strategies. When both UV-B and predators are present, individuals can reconcile potential conflicts by correlating particular trait responses (e.g. combining dark or light body colouration with increased or decreased activity rates to create an appropriate multiple stressor strategy). Optimal combinations of body colour and activity rate are predicted to change across an elevation gradient with increasing UV-B exposure. 2. In this study, we tested how larval amphibians combine changes in body colouration and activity rates to create a correlated response to potentially conflicting selection pressures. We quantified activity and colour response in two amphibian species, the pacific treefrog (Hyla regilla) and the long-toed salamander (Ambystoma macrodactylum), from both high and low elevation populations, and exposed individuals to both a common predator and naturally relevant levels of UV-B. 3. Hyla regilla and A. macrodactylum individuals from low elevation populations responded with correlated response strategies while high elevation populations did not. Low elevation H. regilla coupled decreased activity rates to reduce predator detection with dark body colouration to screen out UV-B. Low elevation A. macrodactylum adopted cryptic colouration when predators were present and decreased activity in response to UV-B. Individuals from high elevation H. regilla and A. macrodactylum populations responded only with changes in activity and not colour change. 4. The observed population differences may reflect variation in selection strengths across an elevation gradient. High elevation habitats may require individuals to focus defence efforts on the greatest potential risk. Additionally, pigmentation changes may not be an adequate defence in these UV-B intense habitats.",1.4.4,Ecosystem and Materials Damage Effects Due to UV B Radiation,0,0

We tested this assumption across a diversity of ecosystems and woody plant species by various methods to explore the circumstances when this assumption is false. Our primary goals were: (1) to evaluate the nature and magnitude of nighttime transpiration, E(n), or stomatal conductance, g(n); and (2) to seek potential generalizations about where and when it occurs. Sap-flow, porometry and stable isotope tracer measurements were made on 18 tree and eight shrub species from seven ecosystem types. Coupled with environmental data, our findings revealed that most of these species transpired at night. For some species and circumstances, nighttime leaf water loss constituted a significant fraction of total daily water use. Our evidence shows that E(n) or g(n) can occur in all but one shrub species across the systems we investigated. However, under conditions of high nighttime evaporative demand or low soil water availability, stomata were closed and E(n) or g(n) approached zero in eleven tree and seven shrub species. When soil water was available, E(n) or g(n) was measurable in these same species demonstrating plasticity for E(n) or g(n). We detected E(n) or g(n) in both trees and shrubs, and values were highest in plants from sites with higher soil water contents and in plants from ecosystems that were less prone to atmospheric or soil water deficits. Irrespective of plant or ecosystem type, many species showed E(n) or g(n) when soil water deficits were slight or non-existent, or immediately after rainfall events that followed a period of soil water deficit. The strongest relationship was between E(n) or g(n) and warm, low humidity and (or) windy (> 0.8 m s(-1)) nights when the vapor pressure deficit remained high (> 0.2 kPa in wet sites, > 0.7 kPa in dry sites). Why E(n) or g(n) occurs likely varies with species and ecosystem type; however, our data support four plausible explanations: (1) it may facilitate carbon fixation earlier in the day because stomata are already open; (2) it may enhance nutrient supply to distal parts of the crown when these nutrients are most available (in wet soils) and transport is rapid; (3) it may allow for the delivery of dissolved O(2) via the parenchyma to woody tissue sinks; or (4) it may occur simply because of leaky cuticles in older leaves or when stomata cannot close fully because of obstructions from stomatal (waxy) plugs, leaf endophytes or asymmetrical guard cells (all non-adaptive reasons).

The ozone plumes generally correspond with the tropospheric column NO2 plumes around these cities as observed by the Scanning Imaging Absorption Spectrometer for Atmospheric Chartography (SCIA-MACHY) instrument. Similar plumes are also seen in tropospheric mean ozone mixing ratio distribution after accounting for the surface and tropopause pressure variations. The total column ozone retrievals indicate fairly significant sensitivity to the lower troposphere over the polluted land areas, which might help explain these detections.

Wood is rapidly degraded by short-wavelength UV radiation, but the penetration of light into wood is positively correlated with its wavelength. Hence, subsurface degradation is likely to be caused by longer-wavelength light that still has sufficient energy to degrade wood. In this paper we test this hypothesis and determine the wavelengths of visible light that extend photo-degradation into wood beyond the zone affected by UV radiation. Sugi (Cryptomeria japonica) earlywood was exposed to UV and visible light with narrow band gaps (20 nm) and the penetration of light into the wood was measured using a photodetector. Photodegradation was depth-profiled using FT-IR microscopy. There was a positive correlation between the penetration of light into sugi earlywood and the wavelength of the incident radiation within the range 246-496 nm. The depth of photodegradation also increased with wavelength up to and including the violet region (403 nm) of the visible spectrum. Blue light (434-496 nm) penetrated wood to a greater extent than violet light and was capable of bleaching the wood, but it did not significantly modify lignin, and hence it was not responsible for sub-surface photodegradation of wood. We conclude that violet light is the component of the visible spectrum that extends photodegradation into wood beyond the zone affected by UV radiation. Accordingly, surface treatments designed to protect wood used outdoors should shield wood from the effects of violet light.",1.4.4,Ecosystem and Materials Damage Effects Due to UV B Radiation,0,0

In soybean, a nitrogen-fixing species, both limitations are less likely than in crops lacking an N-fixing symbiont. Prior studies have used controlled environment or field enclosures where the artificial environment can modify responses to [CO2]. A soybean free air [CO2] enrichment (FACE) facility has provided the first opportunity to analyze the effects of elevated [CO2] on photosynthesis under fully open-air conditions. Potential ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (Rubisco) carboxylation (V-c,(max)) and electron transport through photosystem II (J(max)) were determined from the responses of A(sat) to intercellular [CO2] (C-i) throughout two growing seasons.

Elevated [CO2] increased Asat by 15-20% even though there was a small, statistically significant, decrease in Vc,max. This differs from previous studies in that Vc,(max)/J(max) decreased, inferring a shift in resource investment away from Rubisco. This raised the Ci at which the transition from Rubisco-limited to ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate regeneration-limited photosynthesis occurred. The decrease in V-c,(max) was not the result of a change in gm, which was unchanged by elevated [CO2].

The dependence of g(s) on A, h and [CO2] at the leaf surface was unaltered by long-term growth at elevated [CO2]. This suggests that the commonly observed decrease in g(s) under elevated [CO2] is due entirely to the direct instantaneous effect of [CO2] on g(s) and that there is no longer-term acclimation of g(s) independent of photosynthetic acclimation. The model accurately predicted g(s) for soybean growing under ambient and elevated [CO2] in the field.

In this study, loblolly pine seedlings were planted in the field in recently disturbed soil of high fertility, and CO2 partial pressures were maintained at ambient CO2 (Amb) and elevated CO2 (Amb + 30 Pa) for 4 years. The objective of the study was to measure seasonal and long-term responses in growth and photosynthesis of loblolly pine exposed to elevated CO2 under ambient field conditions of precipitation, light, temperature and nutrient availability. Loblolly pine trees grown in elevated CO2 produced 90% more biomass after four growing seasons than did trees grown in ambient CO2. This large increase in final biomass was primarily due to a 217% increase in leaf area in the first growing season which resulted in much higher relative growth rates for trees grown in elevated CO2. Although there was not a sustained effect of elevated CO2 on relative growth rate after the first growing season, absolute production of biomass continued to increase each year in trees grown in elevated CO2 as a consequence of the compound interest effect of increased leaf area on the production of more new leaf area and more biomass. Allometric analyses of biomass allocation patterns demonstrated size-dependent shifts in allocation, but no direct effects of elevated CO2 on partitioning of biomass. Leaf photosynthetic rates were always higher in trees grown in elevated CO2, but these differences were greater in the summer (60-130% increase) than in the winter (14-44% increase), reflecting strong seasonal effects of temperature on photosynthesis. Our results suggest that seasonal variation in the relative photosynthetic response to elevated CO2 will occur in natural ecosystems, but total non-structural carbohydrate (TNC) levels in leaves indicate that this variation may not always be related to sink activity. Despite indications of canopy-level adjustments in carbon assimilation, enhanced levels of leaf photosynthesis coupled with increased total leaf area indicate that net carbon assimilation for the whole tree was greater for trees grown under elevated CO2 compared with ambient CO2.

This knowledge is important for the future protection of food supplies, for understanding changes in natural ecosystems and for quantifying the role of terrestrial plants in regulating the rate of change of p CO2 and resulting changes in the global climate. Most of our knowledge about these effects has derived from experimental studies that have used open-top or closed chambers. These methods are subject to ?chamber effects? caused by differences in energy balance and water relations that may significantly modify the response of vegetation to elevated p CO2. The small plot sizes imposed by these techniques add other limitations both to interpretation of results and scope of investigations. Free-air carbon dioxide enrichment (FACE) provides an experimental technique for studying the effects of elevated p CO2 on vegetation and other ecosystem components in large unenclosed plots (>20 m diameter). FACE avoids many modifications to the microclimate imposed by chamber methods and therefore provides some of the most reliable estimates of plant response to elevated p CO2. Control of p CO2 in large-scale FACE experiments has now been developed to an extent where performance is similar to that achieved with sophisticated closed-chamber facilities. Experience has shown that, when FACE facilities are fully utilised, the cost per unit of usable ground area enriched with CO2, is significantly lower than alternative methods. The large scale of FACE plots can support a range of integrated studies on the same material, thereby achieving a more complete analysis than has been possible with other methods of elevating p CO2. This review considers the technical aspects of FACE methodology, outlines the major FACE experiments and summarises the advances in understanding of p CO2 effects on ecosystems that it has allowed.",9.4.4.1,Yield,0,0

Small or large quantities of frass, greenfall, or a 1:1 ratio of frass and greenfall were added to microcosms for each FACE treatment (control, +CO2, +O3, +CO2+O3). We measured initial frass and greenfall quality, and recorded microbial respiration, and nitrate leaching over 40 days. Elevated carbon dioxide (eCO2) and tropospheric ozone (eO3) significantly altered the carbon, nitrogen, and condensed tannin content of insect frass and green leaves. Although FACE treatments affected input quality, they had minimal effect on microbial respiration and no effect on nitrogen leaching. In contrast, input quantity substantially influenced microbial respiration and nitrate leaching. Respiratory carbon loss and nitrate immobilization were nearly double in microcosms receiving large amounts of herbivore inputs than those receiving no herbivore inputs. Small amounts of herbivore inputs, however, did not significantly alter microbial respiration or immobilization, suggesting that effects of herbivore inputs on soil processes will be detected only at moderate to high herbivory/input levels.

The calculated changes in the global distribution of ozone and methane have been used to calculate Radiative Forcing (RF) of the current and future fleets (2015 and 2050) of subsonic aircraft. The calculations show that ozone perturbation from aircraft emission occur predominantly in the Northern Hemisphere at mid and high latitudes. Masimum increase in ozone is found in the upper trosphere in the 10 to 12 km height region. The annual average future increases in the region of maximum increase, is estimated to be approximately 12 ppb in 2015. Scenarios for NOx emissions in 2050 are less certain, however; calculations give a near linear increase in global ozone perturbation for increasing NOx in the future over the range of NOx emissions assumed to by realistic until 2050. Calculations with Nox emissions assumed to be realistic until 2050. Calculations with Nox emissions well beyond this range (50% higher than the high NOx emission) showed non-linear ozone response with less ozone increase per NOx increase than in the cases with lower NOx emission from aircraft. There is a a reduction in the methane lifetime due to enhanced OH from NOx emissions. The change in the global methane lifetime is estimated to be -1.3% in 1992 from aircraft emissions, increasing to -3.9% in 2050. Estimates of RF from CH4 and O3 due to aircraft emissions are of opposite sign and of similar magnitude, which makes it difficult to give reliable estimates of the net impact.

Four numerical experiments, where an extra pulse of aircraft NOx was emitted into the model atmosphere for a single month ( January, April, July, or October), were compared to a control experiment, allowing the aircraft impact to be isolated. The extra NOx produces a short-lived ( few months) pulse of ozone that generates a positive radiative forcing. However, the NOx and O-3 both generate OH, which leads to a reduction in CH4. A detailed analysis of the OH budget reveals the spatial structure and chemical reactions responsible for the generation of the OH perturbation. Methane's long lifetime means that the CH4 anomaly decays slowly ( perturbation lifetime of 11.1 years). The negative CH4 anomaly also has an associated negative O-3 anomaly, and both of these introduce a negative radiative forcing. There are important seasonal differences in the response of O-3 and CH4 to aircraft NOx, related to the annual cycle in photochemistry; the O-3 radiative forcing calculations also have a seasonal dependence. The long-term globally integrated annual mean net forcing calculated here is approximately zero, although earlier work suggests a small net positive forcing.

Bromine emission from bromocarbon photo-oxidation and from sea-salt bromine depletion and bromine removal through dry and wet deposition are included. Using this model, tropospheric bromine chemistry and ozone budgets are studied. The zonal mean of the inorganic gas-phase bromine compounds (Br-x) is calculated to be high (4-8 pptv) in the lower troposphere of the midlatitudes to high latitudes in each hemisphere, with decreasing trends with altitude (down to similar to 2-3 pptv in the upper troposphere). The lowest Br-x (&lt;2 pptv) is over low latitudes, corresponding to small sea-salt Br emission and a high rate of precipitation scavenging.

Sea-salt emission plays the dominant role in total Br-x in the lower troposphere while organic Br-containing compounds are important in upper layers.

Many of these compounds interact with agricultural systems and influence crop performance, both directly by affecting growth and quality or indirectly by altering the plant?s ability to cope with other abiotic and biotic stresses. Some atmospheric compounds have little or no discernible impact on the environment; others reach levels that exceed thresholds for damage to crops. In this review, we analyse the literature on airborne species that directly impact crop growth and health. In Europe and North America emissions of SO2, NOx and heavy metals have declined during the past decades and are currently not considered as a major threat to crops. By contrast, air pollutant emissions have been increasing in rapidly growing regions of Asia, Africa and Latin America. Ozone is the most phytotoxic of the common air pollutants. The widespread distribution of O3 already presents a risk to crop growth and health in many regions of the world. It is concluded that the continuous increase in background O3 concentrations will pose a critical threat to future world food security. Interactions with both biotic and abiotic factors must be taken into account in assessing risks of air pollutants in the field. There is evidence that these indirect effects could be more important under certain circumstances than the direct effects of air pollutants on plants. The parallel rapid increase in atmospheric CO2 concentrations accompanied by climate change has two major implications: (1) a possible benefit to crop growth by direct stimulation of photosynthesis and by mitigation of gaseous air pollutants and water stress; and (2) a threat to crop production due to an enhancement of crop quality losses.",9.4.4,Crop Yield and Quality in Agricultural Systems,0,0

Elevated O(3) decreased soil mineral N likely through a reduction in plant material input and increased denitrification, which was evidenced by the greater abundance of the denitrifier gene nosZ. Elevated CO(2) did not alter the parameters evaluated and both elevated CO(2) and O(3) showed no interactive effects on nitrifier and denitrifier abundance, nor on total and mineral N concentrations. These results indicate that elevated CO(2) may have limited effects on N transformations in soybean agroecosystems. However, elevated O(3) can lead to a decrease in soil N availability in both bulk and rhizosphere soils, and this likely also affects ecosystem productivity by reducing the mineralization rates of plant-derived residues.",9.4.6.4,Nutrient Cycling,8.9.3,Soil Nitrogen

As emissions of O3 precursors rise in many parts of the world over the next few decades, yield reductions from O3 exposure appear likely to increase the challenges of feeding a global population projected to grow from 6 to 9 billion between 2000 and 2050. This study estimates year 2000 global yield reductions of three key staple crops (soybean, maize, and wheat) due to surface ozone exposure using hourly O3 concentrations simulated by the Model for Ozone and Related Chemical Tracers version 2.4 (MOZART-2). We calculate crop losses according to two metrics of ozone exposure ? seasonal daytime (08:00?19:59) mean O3 (M12) and accumulated O3 above a threshold of 40 ppbv (AOT40) ? and predict crop yield losses using crop-specific O3 concentration:response functions established by field studies. Our results indicate that year 2000 O3-induced global yield reductions ranged, depending on the metric used, from 8.5?14% for soybean, 3.9?15% for wheat, and 2.2?5.5% for maize. Global crop production losses totaled 79?121 million metric tons, worth $11?18 billion annually (USD2000). Our calculated yield reductions agree well with previous estimates, providing further evidence that yields of major crops across the globe are already being substantially reduced by exposure to surface ozone ? a risk that will grow unless O3-precursor emissions are curbed in the future or crop cultivars are developed and utilized that are resistant to O3.",9.4.4.1,Yield,8.5.2,Yield Loss at Regional and National Scales

We use simulated hourly O3 concentrations from the Model for Ozone and Related Chemical Tracers version 2.4 (MOZART-2), satellite-derived datasets of agricultural production, and field-based concentration:response relationships to calculate crop yield reductions resulting from O3 exposure. We then calculate the associated crop production losses and their economic value. We compare our results to the estimated impact of O3 on global agriculture in the year 2000, which we assessed in our companion paper [Avnery et al., 2011]. In the A2 scenario we find global year 2030 yield loss of wheat due to O3 exposure ranges from 5.4 to 26% (a further reduction in yield of +1.5?10% from year 2000 values), 15?19% for soybean (reduction of +0.9?11%), and 4.4?8.7% for maize (reduction of +2.1?3.2%) depending on the metric used, with total global agricultural losses worth $17?35 billion USD2000 annually (an increase of +$6?17 billion in losses from 2000). Under the B1 scenario, we project less severe but still substantial reductions in yields in 2030: 4.0?17% for wheat (a further decrease in yield of +0.1?1.8% from 2000), 9.5?15% for soybean (decrease of +0.7?1.0%), and 2.5?6.0% for maize (decrease of + 0.3?0.5%), with total losses worth $12?21 billion annually (an increase of +$1?3 billion in losses from 2000). Because our analysis uses crop data from the year 2000, which likely underestimates agricultural production in 2030 due to the need to feed a population increasing from approximately 6 to 8 billion people between 2000 and 2030, our calculations of crop production and economic losses are highly conservative. Our results suggest that O3 pollution poses a growing threat to global food security even under an optimistic scenario of future ozone precursor emissions. Further efforts to reduce surface O3 concentrations thus provide an excellent opportunity to increase global grain yields without the environmental degradation associated with additional fertilizer application or land cultivation.",9.4.4.1,Yield,0,0

Considering the extensive land used for agriculture, cultivated Citrus plantations may play an important role in the chemistry of the atmosphere especially in regions such as the Central Valley of California. Moreover, the BVOC emissions from Citrus species have not been characterized in detail and more species-specific inputs for regional models of BVOC emissions are needed. In this study, we measured the physiological parameters and emissions of the most relevant BVOC (oxygenated compounds, monoterpenes, and sesquiterpenes) for four predominant Citrus species planted in California (Citrus sinensis var. `Parent Navel?, Citrus limon var. `Meyer?, Citrus reticulata var. `W. Murcott? and `Clementine?). We used two analytical techniques to measure a full range of BVOC emitted: Proton Transfer Reaction Mass Spectrometry (PTR-MS) and gas chromatography with mass spectrometry. Methanol, followed by acetone and acetaldehyde, were the dominant BVOC emitted from lemon and mandarin trees (basal emission rates up to 300 ng(C) g(DW)<sup>?1</sup> h<sup>?1</sup>), while oxygenated monoterpenes, monoterpenes, and sesquiterpenes were the main BVOC emitted from orange trees (basal emission rates up to = 2500 ng(C) g(DW)<sup>?1</sup> h<sup>?1</sup>). Light and temperature-dependent algorithms were better predictors of methanol, acetaldehyde, acetone, isoprene and monoterpenes for all the Citrus species. Whereas, temperature-dependent algorithms were better predictors of oxygenated monoterpenes, and sesquiterpenes. We observed that flowering increased emissions from orange trees by an order of magnitude with the bulk of BVOC emissions being comprised of monoterpenes, sesquiterpenes, and oxygenated monoterpenes. Chemical speciation of BVOC emissions show that the various classes of terpene emissions among all Citrus species are dominated by ocimenes, ?-caryophyllene, and linalool, respectively. In addition to utilizing our reported emission factors in BVOC emission models, we recommend that future BVOC emission models consider additional emissions from flowering and harvest, which occur seasonally and may have a significant impact on regional atmospheric chemistry.",9.5.3.2,Diurnal and Seasonal Exposure,0,0

Because the incremental emission controls differ according to region, strong spatial variability in O(3) reductions and in corresponding UV radiation increments is seen. The geographically averaged UV increase is 0.11 ? 0.03%, whereas the population-weighted increase is larger, 0.19 ? 0.06%, because O(3) reductions are greater in more densely populated regions.

In particular, we find that tropospheric ozone is projected to decrease (RCP2.6, RCP4.5 and RCP6) or increase (RCP8.5) between 2000 and 2100, with variations in methane a strong contributor to this spread. The associated tropospheric ozone global radiative forcing is shown to be in agreement with the estimate used in the RCPs, except for RCP8.5. Surface ozone in 2100 is projected to change little compared from its 2000 distribution, a much-reduced impact from previous projections based on the A2 high-emission scenario. In addition, globally-averaged stratospheric ozone is projected to recover at or beyond pre-1980 levels. Anthropogenic aerosols are projected to strongly decrease in the 21st century, a reflection of their projected decrease in emissions. Consequently, sulfate deposition is projected to strongly decrease.

Among them are increases in human population, changes in land use, fire suppression, and frequent droughts. These and other factors have been exacerbating forestsusceptibility to wildfires over the past century in southern California. We report on the significant role that airpollution has had on increasing forestsusceptibility to wildfires, based on a 1999?2003 case study in the San Bernardino Mountains. Airpollution, specifically ozone (O3) and wet and dry deposition of nitrogenous (N) compounds as a by-product of fossil fuel combustion, has significantly increased since urbanization and industrialization of the region after 1945. Ozone and elevated N deposition cause specific changes in forest tree carbon (C), N, and water balance that enhance individual tree susceptibility to drought, bark beetle attack, and disease, and when combined, contribute to whole ecosystem susceptibility to wildfire. For example, elevated O3 and N deposition increase leaf turnover rates, leaf and branch litter, and decrease decomposability of litter, creating excessively deep litter layers in mixed-conifer forests affected by air pollutants. Elevated O3 and N deposition decrease the proportion of whole tree biomass in foliage and roots, thereby increasing tree susceptibility to drought and beetle attack. Because both foliar and root mass are compromised, carbohydrates are stored in the bole over winter. Elevated O3increases drought stress by significantly reducing plant control of water loss. The resulting increase in canopy transpiration, combined with O3 and N deposition-induced decreases in root mass, significantly increases tree susceptibility to drought stress, likely contributing to successful host colonization and population increases of bark beetles. Phenomenological and experimental evidence is presented to support the role of these factors contributing to an increase in the susceptibility of forests to wildfire in southern California.",9.4.8.4,Interactions with Other Pollutants,0,0

Optimum to luxury levels of nitrogen fertilization protected leaves from ozone damage up to 160 mu g m(-3) and strongly reduced ozone injury at the 240 mu g m(-3) level. Enhanced N fertilization reduced the severity of Septoria nodorum leaf blotch, however, it was conducive for infection with powdery mildew (Erysiphe graminis f. sp. tritici) or leaf rust )Puccinia recondita f. sp. tritici). At elevated levels of ozone, N effects on S. nodorum reversed and led to stronger infections with this fungus. Ozone also strongly enhanced the disease-promoting effect of N on the two biotrophic pathogens. Similarly, N fertilization significantly affected the effects of ozone on diseases. At optimum to luxury levels, N markedly strengthened the disease-enhancing effects of ozone on S. nodorum and leaf rust. High N also reduced the inhibiting effects of ozone on powdery mildew. In conclusion, the coincidence of high N fertilization and elevated ozone levels created specifically conducive conditions for infections with each of the three pathogens. Thus, the potential protection of plants from ozone damage by high N supply was gained at the expense of plant health and enhanced considerably the predisposition of wheat for leaf mycoses.",9.4.8.4,Interactions with Other Pollutants,0,0

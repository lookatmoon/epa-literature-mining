# Text-based Approach

For data exploration process (in which we count the most frequent unigrams/bigrams and perform topic modeling): run data_exploration.py.

For training and testing classifier, run text_based_LR.py.

## Some tools used in this pipeline:

Topic Model: Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA).

Classifier: Logistic regression.

## Datasets

Dataset will be released after obtaining permission from providers(U.S. Environmental Protection Agency).

In a study by Zare et al. (2014), a Danish Eulerian Hemispheric Model (DEHM) simulation for the year 2006 indicated that biogenic VOCs enhanced the average ozone mixing ratio by about 11% over the land areas of the Northern Hemisphere relative to a base case simulation for which BVOC were not turned off. In additional sensitivity simulations, Zare et al. (2014) turned off all natural emissions of VOCs, NOX, NH3, SO2, CH4, PM, CO, and sea salt collectively and individually relative to a base case simulation. Zare et al. (2014) acknowledged that the sum of the individual sensitivities can be different from the results of the collective zero-out simulation for the various regions of the world due to nonlinearity in the processes of ozone formation chemistry. The discrepancies are different from region to region because of different atmospheric chemical regimes in each individual region. In a modeling simulation over the continental U. S. (CONUS domain) from May to September 2011, Zhang et al. (2017) used the Comprehensive Air Quality Model with Extensions (CAMx) Ozone Source Apportionment Tool (OSAT) with BEIS. The CAMx OSAT algorithm attributes ozone production to VOCs only when ozone forms under VOC-limited conditions. Zhang et al. (2017) found that domain-wide, biogenic VOCs can contribute on average 10-19% to regional ozone formation, with higher contributions in the western U.S. and lower contributions in the southeastern U.S. Ozone formation in the southeast is typically NOX-limited due to intense BVOC emissions in that region of the U.S. Hence, CAMx OSAT attributes most of the ozone in this region to NOX rather than VOCs."

The remaining 2% of LNOX is formed within the planetary boundary layer.

The high ozone concentrations found at the storm edges were anticorrelated with mixing ratios of measured CO, indicating the stratosphere as the source of the ozone-enriched air.

(2014),"The chemistry driving wintertime ozone episodes seems to be different from the chemistry driving summertime ozone episodes in terms of radical sources, as seen in measurements and by modeling studies. Ozone production involves the hydroxyl (OH) radical, which in summer is primarily formed from the photolysis of pre-existing ozone and subsequent reaction of one of the products of this reaction, the electronically excited state atomic oxygen (O[1D]), with water vapor. There is typically less solar radiation and water vapor during the winter, which is why Edwards et al.

Like Edwards et al. (2014), Ahmadov et al. (2015) suggested that VOC photochemistry is an important source of radicals, including those formed from primary and secondary formaldehyde photolysis, as well as from photolysis of dicarbonyls and hydroxy ketones. Sensitivity studies show the ozone formation regime during the 2013 episodes in the UB was VOC-limited (Ahmadov et al., 2015). In the UGRB, Rappenglück et al. (2014), found that the dominant source of OH production for the winter of 2011 was nitrous acid (HONO) photolysis with minor pathways of production from alkene ozonolysis and formaldehyde photolysis. Rappenglück et al. (2014) suggested the HONO is formed through nitric acid (HNO3) produced during the atmospheric oxidation of NOX deposited onto the snow surface where it undergoes photo-enhanced heterogeneous conversion to HONO as well as combustion-related emissions of HONO. However, Edwards et al. (2014) found that HONO was not present in high concentrations and, therefore, could not be a major source of OH production during winter ozone episodes in the UB. Oil and gas extraction is the only major source of anthropogenic emissions in the remotely located UGRB. These emissions include NOX from compressors and drill rigs and methane and nonmethane hydrocarbons (VOCs) from wellhead production equipment (Rappenglück et al., 2014)."

Reddy and Pfister (2016) found that surface ozone in the western U.S. is well correlated with the 500 millibar (mb) pressure level height. The study showed that the July mean MDA8 ozone increased when the mean July 500 mb height also increased. Over the western U.S., increases in the 500 mb level are often associated with weather (clear skies, low wind) that is conducive to ozone formation. By using the 500 mb height variable to detrend and correct for the influence of meteorology, the study found that July MDA8 ozone has steadily decreased from 1995 to 2013 in the Wasatch Front area surrounding Salt Lake City, UT.

Indoor ozone therefore either infiltrates from outdoors or is generated by indoor sources, such as some types of air purifiers. Part of ozone infiltrating indoors is lost to surface reactions. A variety of metrics and terms are used to characterize air pollution exposure. They are described here to provide clarity for the subsequent discussion."

Classical exposure measurement error is defined as exposure measurement error scattered around the true personal exposure and independent of the level of the measured exposure. Classical exposure measurement error may occur when a fixed-site monitor measuring ambient concentration is imprecise, even if it is accurate, and it is also independent of time and space (Szpiro et al., 2011). Classical exposure measurement error can result in bias of the epidemiologic effect estimate.

LUR models regress observed ozone concentrations on land use (and sometimes additional geographic) covariates and then use the model to predict ambient concentrations where ozone is not measured. The 2013 Ozone ISA cites high concentration resolution as a strength of the LUR approach. However, for ozone, a lack of monitors near roads prevents accurate characterization of ambient concentration in these locations where scavenging by NO can increase the gradient of ozone concentration. A limited number of studies employed LUR for ozone exposure assessment at the time of the 2013 Ozone ISA. Specifically, validation of LUR model results for annual average ozone in urban areas was low (R2 = 0.06), but the model performed better in rural areas (R2 = 0.62). The 2013 Ozone ISA did not review spatiotemporal modeling."

The chemistry is specified in the model, and concentrations of air pollutants (e.g., ozone) are outputted to a discrete grid. However, CTMs are limited by their grid cell resolution (e.g., the grid resolution may not accurately reflect the true heterogeneity of concentration), may be resource intensive to run.

In July, overprediction occurred for CAMx while underprediction occurred for CMAQ when compared to monitor data, as noted in Appendix 1 (Section 1.6.2). Underprediction was mostly due to underestimation of emissions precursors and peak temperatures. Wang et al. (2016) modeled surface ozone in Los Angeles, CA over the years 2000-2008 and found that ozone had a greater root mean squared error (RMSE) for the University of California at Davis—California Institute of Technology (UCD-CIT) CTM in rural areas, especially during the warm season.

(2011) compared CMAQ with Weather Research and Forecasting coupled with Chemistry (WRF/Chem) across the continental U.S. (CONUS) in August 2006. While CMAQ generally performed better than WRF/Chem, both CTMs overpredicted the 8-hour daily max ozone concentration (e.g., mean bias was 3.62 ppb for CMAQ). WRF/Chem likely predicted higher ozone concentrations due to vertical mixing in the boundary layer, dry deposition, and convection schemes. Many studies covered approximately all of the CONUS (Appel et al., 2017; Appel et al., 2013; Appel et al., 2012) or covered localized, urban areas of either the U.S. or Canada [e.g., Houston, TX; Seattle, WA; San Joaquin Valley, CA; Los Angeles, CA; Vancouver, Canada; Wang et al.

These studies collected data under different circumstances, and in some cases, variables could not be combined. Validation techniques for the data inputted into CHAD may have differed across studies, and it is possible that participants were not precise in providing time increments or that missingness of data could have been handled differently across studies.

In contrast, the risk ratios of asthma ED visits and PM2.5 and NOX exposures showed some sensitivity to AER. High levels of poverty (8.5% threshold) were associated with high AER.

(2016) used 24-hour avg temporal and spatiotemporal ozone concentrations in models of the risk of inpatient hospitalization or outpatient ED visits for asthma in a case-crossover analysis in New York City. For both outcomes, no difference between models including only a temporal model of ozone concentration or a spatiotemporal model of ozone concentration could be ascertained, implying that spatial variability was not important for this time-series study of ambient ozone exposure. Goldman et al. (2010) simulated the effect of spatial error with and without autocorrelation on risk ratio and found that the risk was slightly underestimated when spatial error was added (with autocorrelation: relative risk, RR = 1.0128 per ppm; without autocorrelation: RR = 1.0126 per ppm compared with a base case RR = 1.0139 with no spatial error added)."

These errors can potentially occur for fixed-site monitors, data averaging, LUR, spatiotemporal models, CTMs, and hybrid approaches (Table 2-7). Jones et al.

Little differences between the mean and confidence interval of the hazard ratios were observed for the entire population for respiratory hospitalizations (fixed-site: 1.013 confidence interval, CI 0.999-1.028; mean error, ME: 1.013, CI 0.998-1.029) and asthma hospitalizations (fixed-site: 1.029, CI 1.010-1.047; ME: 1.029, CI 1.009-1.049). However, differences in hazard ratios were noted for the 5-14 year (fixed-site: 1.056, ME: 1.013), 15-24 year (fixed-site: 1.051, ME: 1.013), 25-64 year (fixed-site: 1.021, ME: 1.013), and ≥65 year (fixed-site: 0.993, ME: 1.015) age groups. The ≥65-years-old group, which spends the most time indoors (Table 2-1), was the only group for which the effect was underestimated by the fixed-site monitor concentrations."

Panel studies representing short-term exposure to ozone typically use active or passive microenvironmental monitors to represent exposure (Table 2-7). A strength of the measurement methods is the ability to have a representation of the exposure at the location of the individuals being studied, while a limitation is greater sensitivity to instrument errors. Active monitors are subject to interference from humidity and copollutants, while passive monitors have diffusion-related losses when ozone reacts with the instrument manifold. These instrument errors tend to be small but negative (i.e., the instrument reports a lower concentration than the true concentration). Because panel studies take measurements at the exposed individual sites, correlation between change in effect with change in exposure is less important than estimating the relationship between the ozone exposure and the occurrence of the health effect. As a result, instrument error from use of microenvironmental monitors could add a small amount of positive bias to effect estimates."

These methods include fixed-site monitors, data averaging, IDW, kriging, LUR, spatiotemporal modeling, CTMs, hybrid models, and microenvironmental models. IDW, kriging, LUR, spatiotemporal modeling, CTMs, and hybrid models are spatial concentration prediction models listed in order of increasing sophistication (i.e., producing increasing model fit; Section 2.3.2). In recent studies, hybrid models incorporating CTM output with satellite data have produced simulated ambient ozone concentration surfaces with low spatial model error at a national scale [e.g., Robichaud and Menard (2014)]. Higher resolution exposure assessment models are intended to minimize bias and uncertainty in the effect estimate due to spatial variability. Microenvironmental models incorporate time-activity patterns, including indoor and outdoor microenvironments along with information like AER, which influences I/O ratios (Section 2.4.2), with high spatial resolution of ambient ozone concentration predictions to estimate ambient ozone exposures among the population."

Model misspecification, where an exposure assessment model is not fit with the correct predictive variables, can also lead to bias in the effect estimate in either direction. Omission of time-activity data in the spatiotemporal exposure assessment models can decrease precision in the effect estimate because variability in the exposure is curtailed without time-activity patterns. Likewise, omission of time-activity data can result in negative bias when it causes the spatial correlation between the exposure estimate and the effect to decrease. Dionisio et al. (2014) recently compared effect estimates derived from a microenvironmental model of exposure with effect estimates derived from a CTM. Using personal exposure as a reference, the effect estimate was considered to be negatively biased when the CTM alone was used.

Recently published data on I/O ratios (Section 2.4.2), P/A ratios (Section 2.4.3), and associated correlations (Section 2.5) are similar to those presented in the 2013 Ozone ISA. Likewise, ambient ozone characteristics, including its spatial distribution over urban scales, high variability near roads, and seasonal and diurnal variation, have not changed substantially since the 2013 Ozone ISA. More information is now available on losses of ozone at surfaces, and those studies support the published ratios. Personal measurements of ozone exposure (Section 2.3.1.2) from active or passive monitors are subject to interference from humidity, mercury, and VOCs (active monitors) or from deposition to the sampling manifold (passive monitors). This can lead to positively biased concentrations and negatively biased effect estimates."

Biases tend to be small in magnitude for this reason. Localized atmospheric chemistry near NOX sources (i.e., ozone sinks) such as highways may result in overestimation of exposure when ozone concentration monitored away from the highway is used in an epidemiologic analysis. Data averaging techniques (Section 2.3.1.2), including IDW and kriging, provide spatial interpolation where monitors are sparse, but they can produce a less precise exposure estimate compared with hybrid or spatiotemporal models."

Both LUR and spatiotemporal modeling (Section 2.3.2.2) can be subject to model misspecification, where the model is not fit with the optimal set of variables. Larger exposure measurement errors can occur if the models are fit to one location and then applied in a different location. CTMs have greatly expanded in usage and in number of available models (Section 2.3.2.3). Misspecification can occur through inadequate characterization of emissions, meteorology, and chemistry. High magnitude errors most typically happen around low and high ozone modeled outputs. Spatiotemporal models sometimes become the framework for incorporating CTMs, satellite data (Section 2.3.2.4), and fixed-site monitoring data (Section 2.3.2.1) into a single hybrid model. By combining so many sources of data, overfitting may be a larger concern for the hybrid model than for other exposure estimation models."

Respiratory responses to acute ozone exposures in the range of ambient concentrations (i.e., ≤80 ppb) include decreased inspiratory capacity; mild bronchoconstriction as demonstrated by increases in sRaw; rapid, shallow breathing patterns during exercise; and symptoms of cough and pain on deep inspiration. Reflex inhibition of inspiration results in a decrease in forced vital capacity (FVC) and total lung capacity (TLC) and, in combination with mild bronchoconstriction (i.e., airway obstruction), contributes to a decrease in the forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1).

Controlled human exposure studies involving exposure to 400-420 ppb ozone provided evidence that nociceptive sensory nerves, presumably bronchial C-fibers, were responsible for pain-related symptoms and inhibition of maximal inspiration that resulted in decreased FVC. Eicosanoids, which are products of arachidonic acid metabolism, may also play a role in this response. Mild airway obstruction, measured as changes in sRaw, in response to ozone exposure, is inhibited by pretreatment with atropine, indicating the involvement of the parasympathetic nervous system. Tachykinins may also contribute to increases in sRaw because ozone exposure (250 ppb) increased substance P in BALF. Moreover, ozone exposure (200 ppb) resulted in a loss of substance P immunoreactivity in the neurons of the bronchial mucosa. Substance P is released by sensory nerves and mediates neurogenic edema and bronchoconstriction. Thus, increased sRaw may be attributed to vagally mediated pathways and to local axon reflexes."

Although changes in lung function have generally been found to be unrelated to inflammatory responses of the lung following ozone exposure, significant relationships have been reported between FEV1 decrements and plasma ferritin [r = -0.67, p = 0.003; i.e., larger FEV1 decrements in individuals with lower baseline plasma ferritin (Ghio et al., 2014), and with the inflammatory cytokine IFN-γ in the blood (Stiegel et al., 2017)].

Relatively consistent with the Adams (2002) and Adams (2006) studies of 6.6-hour exposures to 40 ppb with quasi-continuous exercise, the 4-hour exposure to 40 ppb with two 20-minute periods of light exercise caused no statistically significant changes in lung function in the study by Hoffmeyer et al.

Activation of sensory nerves in the airway epithelium occurs as a result of ozone exposure. Stimulation of bronchial C-fibers leads to rapid, shallow breathing and other changes in respiratory mechanics in response to ozone. TRPA1 ion channels, which are found on a subset of bronchial C-fibers, may be activated by secondary oxidation products of ozone and components of the extracellular lining fluid in the respiratory tract, such as aldehydes. In addition, arachidonic acid metabolites, such as prostaglandins, may be involved in activation or sensitization of the TRPA1 ion channels. As discussed previously, these airway sensory nerves are vagal afferents that carry signals to the nucleus tractus solitarius neurons in the brain. These pathways can be integrated in the brain, resulting in altered autonomic activity that affects the airways (e.g., bronchoconstriction) or extrapulmonary responses such as changes in heart rhythm. Stress-responsive regions of the brain may also be affected by these vagal afferent pathways from the respiratory tract. In addition, activation of bronchial C-fibers may lead to local axon reflex responses in the airways, such as the release of substance P or other tachykinins, which act through neurokinin receptors to increase airway resistance (i.e., bronchoconstriction)."

In general, airway responsiveness is assessed by increasing inhaled concentrations of a bronchoconstrictive drug and measuring the effect on lung mechanics (FEV1 or sRaw). A dose-dependent increase in airway responsiveness of young, healthy, nonsmoking males following exposures to 0, 80, 100, and 120 ppb ozone (6.6 hours, quasi-continuous moderate exercise at 39 L/minute) has been demonstrated. Changes in airway responsiveness appear to persist longer than changes in pulmonary function, although this has been studied only on a limited basis. Studies suggest that ozone-induced increases in airway responsiveness usually resolve 18 to 24 hours after exposure but may persist in some individuals for longer periods. Although FEV1 decrements and respiratory symptoms become attenuated following several consecutive days of ozone exposure, the ozone-induced increase in airway responsiveness (measured by increase in sRaw upon methacholine challenge) over 5 consecutive days is not attenuated. Increases in airway responsiveness following ozone exposure do not appear to be associated with ozone-induced changes in lung function, respiratory symptoms, or changes in epithelial permeability. First described in the 1986 ozone AQCD (U.S. EPA, 1986), a mechanistic study of subjects exposed to 600 ppb ozone while exercising added to the understanding of mechanisms underlying changes in airway responsiveness caused by ozone exposure. Atropine inhibited an ozone-induced increase in airway responsiveness to histamine, indicating the involvement of the parasympathetic nervous system in this response. A recent study of 38 healthy adult women (average age, 26 years) exposed to 0 and 400 ppb ozone for 2 hours performing light intermittent exercise (15-minute periods of exercise at 25 L/minute and seated rest) showed a tendency (statistical significance not assessed by investigators) for increases in airway responsiveness due to ozone with 4 and 12 subjects being responsive to methacholine after exposure to filtered air and ozone, respectively (Bennett et al., 2016).

Acute exposures generally consisted of a single exposure to 2 ppm ozone for 3 hours. Subacute exposures generally consisted of exposure to 0.3 ppm ozone for 24-72 hours. One study compared responses with acute and subacute exposures over time (Cho et al., 2013). Other exposure concentration-durations, including repeated exposures over several days, have been employed. Some studies investigated the role of specific cell signaling pathways in mediating responses by using genetic knockout models or pharmacologic agents. Inflammation, injury, and oxidative stress were commonly assessed by measurement of cells and biological markers in the BALF. Some studies also employed histopathology and/or immunocytochemistry of lung tissue.

Direct measurements of airway resistance were made in naïve and allergic rats (sensitized and challenged with nDer f 1). Ozone exposure induced rapid shallow breathing in all the rats, but the response was greatest in the allergic rats. Ozone exposure also increased airway resistance (i.e., bronchoconstriction) in allergic rats, but not in naïve rats. The mechanisms underlying increased airway resistance were explored using vagotomy and pharmacological agents and were found to involve vagal C-fibers, vagal myelinated fibers, and possibly mediators released in the airway. Vagal lung C-fibers mediated the reflex bronchoconstriction to ozone. The vagal myelinated fibers mediate a reflex bronchodilation. Neuropeptides (e.g., substance P) may also be involved in the bronchoconstrictive response. This new study provides evidence that ozone exposure exacerbates bronchoconstriction in allergic animals. Sensory nerve pathways, specifically vagal afferents, played an important role in increased airway resistance."

Along with symptoms, variable airway obstruction, and airway inflammation, airway hyperresponsiveness is a primary feature in the clinical definition and characterization of asthma severity. Thus, individuals with asthma generally have greater baseline airway responsiveness than those unaffected by asthma. Similar relative changes (i.e., percent decrease in provocative dose caused by ozone exposure) in airway responsiveness are seen in subjects with asthma and healthy control subjects exposed to ozone despite their markedly different baseline airway responsiveness [see Section 6.2.2.1 of U.S. EPA (2013a)]. There are no new studies evaluating the effect of ozone exposure on airway responsiveness in individuals with asthma. Increased airway responsiveness can be an important consequence of exposure to ambient ozone in individuals with asthma because their airways are potentially predisposed to narrowing on inhalation of a variety of stimuli. An important aspect of ozone-induced increases in airway responsiveness is that this effect may provide biological plausibility for associations observed between increases in ambient ozone concentrations and increased respiratory symptoms in children with asthma and increased hospital admissions and ED visits for asthma."

Direct measurements of airway resistance were made in naïve and allergic rats (sensitized and challenged with nDer f 1) following ozone exposure (1 ppm, 8 hours). Ozone exposure enhanced allergen-induced airway resistance (i.e., increase in specific airway responsiveness) in allergic rats to a greater degree than in naïve rats. This was an early airway response; no late airway response was observed. The mechanisms underlying this response were explored using vagotomy and pharmacological agents and demonstrated the involvement of vagal C-fibers, vagal myelinated fibers, and possibly neuropeptides released in the airway. Results indicated that vagal lung C-fibers mediated the enhanced specific airway reactivity (to the allergen). Neuropeptides (e.g., substance P) may also be involved in the bronchoconstrictive response to allergen."

Indicating allergic skewing of responses, increases in airway eosinophils and the Th2 cytokine IL-5 were observed in subjects with atopy and mild asthma exposed to 160-400 ppb ozone. In addition, increased expression of high and low affinity IgE receptors on sputum macrophages, which may enhance IgE-dependent inflammation, was observed. Studies of subjects with allergic asthma also found increased expression of TLR4 and CD86. While TLR4 is an activator of innate immunity, CD86 is associated with Th2 responses. Prior allergen challenge enhanced nasal and airway eosinophilia in subjects with mild asthma exposed to ozone. Studies indicated that ozone exposure enhances components of allergic inflammation. In addition, controlled human exposure studies have shown increased airway responsiveness in subjects with mild allergic asthma and allergic rhinitis exposed to 120-250 ppb ozone.

However, the statistical tests the authors used did not support their conclusions: the tests appeared to be relative to a baseline, were not adjusted to responses following air control, and were not performed across seasons. The authors did not correctly test for differences across seasons, rather seasonal effects were inferred based on significant changes during pollen season versus no change out of pollen season."

The adaptive immune system may also be involved via alterations in antigen presentation and co-stimulation by innate immune cells such as macrophages and dendritic cells, which may lead to T-cell activation. Controlled human exposure studies described in Section 6.2.5 of the 2013 Ozone ISA (U.S. EPA, 2013a) show that ozone exposure results in airway neutrophilia, reflecting activation of the innate immune system, and altered antigen presentation in macrophages and dendritic cells. Subjects involved in these studies were exposed to 80-400 ppb ozone with moderate intermittent exercise. Enhanced adaptive immunity may bolster defenses against infection, as well as increase allergic responses via T-cell activation. Other controlled human exposure studies showed minimal effects of ozone exposure on macrophage phagocytosis or function. In asthmatics, there is increased uptake of particles by airway macrophages that may also enhance the processing of particulate antigens and lead to greater progression of allergic airway disease and contribute to an increased risk of asthma exacerbation. There are no new controlled human exposure studies contributing to this evidence base."

Increased susceptibility to challenge with infectious agents was observed at ozone concentrations of 0.08-0.5 ppm. Decreases in mucociliary clearance occurred following exposure to 1 ppm ozone and altered macrophage phagocytosis or function following exposure to 0.1 ppm ozone. In addition, effects on adaptive immunity, such as altered T cell subsets in the spleen (0.6 ppm), decreased antibody response following influenza virus infection (0.5 ppm), and decreased mitogen activated T-cell proliferation (0.5 ppm), have been reported. Effects on natural killer cells, which are effectors of innate and adaptive immunity, have also been reported with decreased activity at concentrations of 0.6-1 ppm, and increased activity or no effect at lower concentrations. Acute exposures to 2 ppm ozone resulted in SP-A oxidation and impairment of SP-A dependent phagocytosis, which led to increased susceptibility to pneumonia."

Several studies found that cyclic challenge of infant rhesus monkeys to allergen and ozone during the postnatal period compromised airway growth and development and resulted in changes that favor allergic airways responses, increased airway responsiveness, and persistent effects on the immune system. Rhesus monkeys were chosen as a model because the branching pattern and distribution of airways in rhesus monkeys are more similar to humans than those of rodents. In addition, a model of allergic airways disease, which exhibits the main features of human asthma, had already been established in the adult rhesus monkey. Studies in infant monkeys were designed to determine whether repeated exposure to ozone altered postnatal lung growth and development, and if so, whether such effects were reversible. In addition, exposure to ozone was evaluated for its potential to increase the development of allergic airways disease. The animals were exposed episodically to ozone beginning at 1 month of age. The exposure regimen involved biweekly cycles of alternating filtered air and ozone (i.e., 9 consecutive days of filtered air and 5 consecutive days of 0.5 ppm ozone, 8 hour/day) and to house dust mite allergen (HDMA) for 2 hours per day for 3 days on the last 3 days of ozone exposure, followed by 11 days of filtered air. In most of these studies, infant monkeys were sensitized to HDMA before the start of the cyclical exposures. These animals exhibited the hallmarks of allergic asthma for humans including a positive skin test for HDMA with elevated levels of IgE in serum and IgE-positive cells within the tracheobronchial airway walls; impaired airflow which was reversible by treatment with aerosolized albuterol; increased abundance of immune cells, especially eosinophils in airway exudates and bronchial lavage; and development of nonspecific airway responsiveness."

Baseline airway resistance and airway responsiveness to inhaled histamine were dramatically increased by combined exposure to ozone plus HDMA. This finding suggests that long-term ozone exposure may contribute to the effects of asthma in children. A follow-up study assessing ex vivo airway responsiveness of the infant monkeys found that ozone plus HDMA exposure resulted in increased airway responsiveness in the respiratory bronchioles, where dosimetric models indicated that the dose would be higher. In another study, the growth pattern of distal airways was changed to a large extent by exposure to ozone alone and in combination with HDMA. More specifically, the airways became longer and narrower and the number of conducting airway generations between the trachea and the gas exchange area was decreased. This effect was not ameliorated by a recovery period of 6 months in filtered air. Other structural changes included increases in mucus goblet cell mass and alterations in smooth muscle orientation in the respiratory bronchioles, epithelial nerve fiber distribution, and basement membrane zone morphometry, all of which could potentially contribute to airway obstruction and increased airway responsiveness. Additional effects on neural innervation in the epithelium of the conducting airways were observed in response to ozone alone or ozone plus HDMA, including decreased nerve fiber density and altered nerve bundle morphology. Six months of recovery in filtered air led to reversal of some, but not all, of these structural and functional effects."

These effects were not evident after a 6-month recovery period in filtered air. Challenge with LPS, which activates monocytes and other innate immune cells, elicited a lower response in ozone-exposed animals. While increased airway eosinophilia suggests an increased allergic profile, the decreased response to LPS suggests diminished host defenses. Other effects on the developing immune system of exposure to ozone plus HDMA included increased CD4+ and CD8+ lymphocytes in blood and BALF and activated lymphocytes (CD25+ cells) in airway mucosa."

The three-dimensional detail of the nasal passages was analyzed for developing predictive dosimetry models and exposure dose-response relationships. The relative amounts of the five epithelial cell types in the nasal airways remained consistent between infancy and adulthood. Ozone exposure resulted in 50-80% decreases in epithelial thickness and epithelial cell volume of the ciliated respiratory and transitional epithelium, confirming that these cell types in the nasal cavity were the most sensitive to ozone exposure. The character and location of nasal lesions were similar in infant and adult monkeys that were similarly exposed. However, the nasal epithelium of infant monkeys did not undergo nasal airway epithelial remodeling or adaptation which occurs in adult animals following ozone-mediated injury and which may protect against subsequent ozone challenge. This lack of remodeling suggests the potential for developing persistent necrotizing rhinitis following longer term exposure."

Exposures were to episodic ozone beginning at 1 month of age. This involved biweekly cycles of alternating filtered air and ozone (i.e., 9 consecutive days of filtered air and 5 consecutive days of 0.5 ppm ozone, 8 hour/day) and to house dust mite allergen (HDMA) for 2 hours per day for 3 days on the last 3 days of ozone exposure, followed by 11 days of filtered air. Eleven cycles of episodic ozone exposure (0.5 ppm) did not increase airway responsiveness to histamine in vivo or airway responsiveness to acetylcholine in an in vitro study using tracheal rings. In fact, responsiveness to acetylcholine was decreased by postnatal ozone exposure and exogenous serotonin. When electrical field stimulation, which causes the release of acetylcholine from airway nerves, was used to test the properties of the airway smooth muscle in the tracheal rings model, the response was not increased in the ozone or ozone/HDMA groups. But when exogenous serotonin was added, the electrical field stimulation response was enhanced in the ozone and ozone/HDMA groups. Airway smooth muscle contraction to electrical field stimulation is a measure of post-ganglionic and parasympathetic-mediated processes. Experiments with receptor agonists and antagonists found that postnatal ozone exposure enhanced the excitatory parasympathetic pathway in the presence of serotonin. Postnatal exposure to HDMA also had this effect and it enhanced intrinsic airway smooth muscle contractility. The result of postnatal exposure to ozone and HDMA was a hyperresponsive airway. This study provides evidence of a functional change in the airways due to postnatal ozone exposure. The presence of the neurotransmitter serotonin is required for the enhanced airway smooth muscle contraction. Given that previous work from this laboratory showed increased serotonin positive cells in the airway resulting from postnatal ozone exposure, the development of asthma in this model could be due to increased serotonin acting on post-ganglionic parasympathetic fibers to increase airway responsiveness."

Five cycles of episodic ozone exposure (0.5 ppm) resulted in decreased alveolar number, increased alveolar volume, decreased distribution of alveolar volume, and decreased capillary surface density in infant monkeys that were sensitized to HDMA. These changes reflect reduced alveolarization, which was also seen in infant monkeys exposed to 5 cycles of episodic ozone and HDMA challenge (ozone/HDMA). However, these changes were not seen after 11 cycles of episodic ozone exposure. Instead, increases in lobe volume were seen in the HDMA/ozone group, suggesting that a ""catch-up"" phase of alveolarization had occurred. Changes in TGF-β gene expression in lung parenchyma occurred between 5 and 11 cycles of episodic ozone exposure in ozone and ozone/HDMA groups, suggesting that TGF-β played a role in the later alveolarization."

After a 30-month recovery period, the number of alveoli in the right middle lobe was increased in the ozone/HDMA group compared with controls. The coefficient of variation of distribution of mean number-weighted alveolar volumes and ratio of pulmonary capillary to inter-alveolar septal surface in the left cranial lobe was also increased after a 30-month recovery period in the ozone/HDMA group compared with controls.

While most of the studies were conducted in rodents, a few involved chronic exposures to ozone in adult or young adult monkeys. Chronic ozone exposure (0.12-1 ppm) resulted in damage to the distal airways and proximal alveoli, resulting in persistent inflammation and lung tissue remodeling, leading to irreversible changes. Some studies demonstrated increased collagen synthesis and deposition, inducing fibrotic-like changes in the lung. Changes in other components of the extracellular matrix, such as glycosaminoglycans, were reported. Some of these effects were found to be dependent on the TGF-β signaling pathway. Other studies demonstrated emphysematous-like changes or attenuation of inflammation. Thus, chronic ozone exposure may lead to persistent inflammation and interstitial remodeling that may contribute to the progression and development of chronic lung disease, such as pulmonary fibrosis and COPD. In addition, chronic ozone exposure (0.12-0.5 ppm) is capable of damaging nasal airways resulting in altered structure and function, as demonstrated by increased mucus flow and goblet cell metaplasia."

Recent studies use fixed-site monitors and models (e.g., CMAQ, dispersion models) measure, estimate, or predict ozone concentrations for use in assigning long-term ozone exposure in epidemiologic studies. There are also hybrid methods that combine two or more fixed-site, mode, and/or satellite-based techniques (Appendix 2 Section 2.3). Generally, epidemiologic studies of long-term ozone exposure and total mortality use a long-term average (e.g., annual or seasonal average) of the 8-hour daily max ozone metric, though there are some studies that use the 24-hour avg [e.g., Sesé et al. (2017)], or the 1-hour daily max [e.g., Jerrett et al. (2009)] metric when calculating long-term average concentrations. The exposure metric used in each study is recorded in the Evidence Inventory tables (Section 6.3.2) for each study when that information was reported by study authors. The strongest evidence comes from analyses of the Medicare cohort data, including a study observing positive associations among different cohorts with pre-existing disease (Zanobetti and Schwartz, 2011) included in the 2013 Ozone ISA, and a recent analysis of more than 61 million individuals in the Medicare cohort (Di et al., 2017b).

Nonetheless, one study reported that 25% of the BALB/c mouse dams in the highest ozone exposure group (1.2 ppm, short-term exposure GDs 9-18), compared to 55% in the filtered air group, did not complete a successful pregnancy (Sharkhuu et al., 2011). Ozone administration (continuous 0.4, 0.8 or 1.2 ppm ozone) to CD-1 mouse dams throughout most of the pregnancy (short-term exposure, PNDs 7-17, which excludes the preimplantation period) led to no adverse effects on reproductive success [proportion of successful pregnancies, litter size, sex ratio, frequency of still birth, or neonatal mortality; Bignami et al. (1994)]. There was a statistically nonsignificant increase in pregnancy duration (0.8 and 1.2 ppm ozone). Initially, dam body weight (0.8 and 1.2 ppm ozone), water consumption (0.4, 0.8 and 1.2 ppm ozone), and feed consumption (0.4, 0.8 and 1.2 ppm ozone) during pregnancy were decreased with ozone exposure, but these deficits dissipated a week or two after the initial exposure (Bignami et al., 1994). This anorexigenic effect of ozone exposure on the pregnant dam appeared to subside with time; the dams seemed to adapt to the ozone exposure. Some evidence suggests that ozone may affect reproductive success when combined with other chemicals. Kavlock et al. (1979) reported that ozone acted synergistically with sodium salicylate to increase the rate of pup resorptions after midgestational exposure (1.0 ppm ozone, short-term exposure, GDs 9-12).

Ozone administration (continuous 0.4, 0.8 or 1.2 ppm ozone) to CD-1 mouse dams throughout most of the pregnancy (short-term exposure, PNDs 7-17, which excludes the preimplantation period) led to no adverse effects on reproductive success [proportion of successful pregnancies, litter size, sex ratio, frequency of still birth, or neonatal mortality; Bignami et al.

Initially, dam body weight (0.8 and 1.2 ppm ozone), water consumption (0.4, 0.8 and 1.2 ppm ozone), and feed consumption (0.4, 0.8 and 1.2 ppm ozone) during pregnancy were decreased with ozone exposure, but these deficits dissipated a week or two after the initial exposure (Bignami et al., 1994). This anorexigenic effect of ozone exposure on the pregnant dam appeared to subside with time; the dams seemed to adapt to the ozone exposure. Some evidence suggests that ozone may affect reproductive success when combined with other chemicals. Kavlock et al.

In addition, outcome definitions for autism, which is a heterogenous condition with potentially different etiologies, varied across studies. For example, Becerra et al. (2013) and Volk et al. (2013) included cases of autistic disorder or full syndrome autism, which are the most severe among the autism spectrum disorders (ASD)."

For instance, they can provide a range of treatment levels including clean air (charcoal-filtered [CF]) control, ambient air control, and several above ambient concentrations for ozone experiments. Depending on experimental intent, a replicated, clean-air control treatment is an essential component in many experimental designs. The OTC can provide a consistent, definable exposure because of the constant wind speed and delivery systems. Statistically robust concentration-response (C-R) functions can be developed using such systems to evaluate the implications of various alternative air quality scenarios on vegetation response. Nonetheless, there are several characteristics of the OTC design and operation that can lead to exposures that might differ from those experienced by plants in the field. First, the OTC plants are subjected to constant air flow turbulence, which, by lowering the boundary layer resistance to diffusion, may result in increased uptake. This may lead to an overestimation of effects relative to areas with less turbulence (Krupa et al., 1995; Legge et al., 1995). Research has also found that OTCs may slightly change the vapor-pressure deficit (VPD) in a way that may decrease the uptake of ozone into leaves (Piikki et al., 2008). As with all methods that expose vegetation to modified ozone concentrations in chambers, OTCs create internal environments that differ from ambient air. This so-called ""chamber effect"" refers to the modification of microclimatic variables, including reduced and uneven light intensity, uneven rainfall, constant wind speed, reduced dew formation, and increased air temperatures (Fuhrer, 1994; Manning and Krupa, 1992). However, in at least one case where canopy resistance was quantified in OTCs and in the field, it was determined that gaseous pollutant exposure to crops in OTCs was similar to that which would have occurred at the same concentration in the field (Unsworth et al., 1984a, b). Because of the standardized methodology and protocols used in the National Crop Loss Assessment Network (NCLAN) (Section 8.13.2) and similar programs, the databases are generally assumed to be internally consistent."

The OTC can provide a consistent, definable exposure because of the constant wind speed and delivery systems. Statistically robust concentration-response (C-R) functions can be developed using such systems to evaluate the implications of various alternative air quality scenarios on vegetation response. Nonetheless, there are several characteristics of the OTC design and operation that can lead to exposures that might differ from those experienced by plants in the field. First, the OTC plants are subjected to constant air flow turbulence, which, by lowering the boundary layer resistance to diffusion, may result in increased uptake. This may lead to an overestimation of effects relative to areas with less turbulence (Krupa et al., 1995; Legge et al., 1995). Research has also found that OTCs may slightly change the vapor-pressure deficit (VPD) in a way that may decrease the uptake of ozone into leaves (Piikki et al., 2008). As with all methods that expose vegetation to modified ozone concentrations in chambers, OTCs create internal environments that differ from ambient air. This so-called ""chamber effect"" refers to the modification of microclimatic variables, including reduced and uneven light intensity, uneven rainfall, constant wind speed, reduced dew formation, and increased air temperatures (Fuhrer, 1994; Manning and Krupa, 1992). However, in at least one case where canopy resistance was quantified in OTCs and in the field, it was determined that gaseous pollutant exposure to crops in OTCs was similar to that which would have occurred at the same concentration in the field (Unsworth et al., 1984a, b). Because of the standardized methodology and protocols used in the National Crop Loss Assessment Network (NCLAN) (Section 8.13.2) and similar programs, the databases are generally assumed to be internally consistent."

In general, these systems allow for two ozone levels (local ambient and elevated). Computer-controlled feedback from the monitoring of gas concentration regulates the feed rate of enriched air to the dispersion pipes. Feedback of wind speed and directional information ensures that the discharges only occur upwind of the treatment plots, and that discharge is restricted or closed down during periods of low wind speed or calm conditions. The diameter of the arrays and their height (25-30 m) in some FACE systems require large throughputs of enriched air per plot, particularly in forest tree systems. The cost of the throughputs tends to limit the number of enrichment treatments, although Hendrey et al. (1999) argued that the cost on an enriched volume basis is comparable to that of chamber systems. In a similar system, the SoyFACE uses an octagon (21 m in diameter) of horizontal pipes that releases ozone to provide a constant elevated ozone concentration above the concurrent local ozone concentration. Ozone release is maintained at approximately 10 cm above the top of the crop canopy throughout the growing season by raising the horizontal pipes as the crop grows taller (Morgan et al., 2004; Miglietta et al., 2001).

Because mixing is unassisted and completely dependent on wind turbulence and diffusion, local gradients are inevitable, especially in large-scale systems. FACE systems have provisions for shutting down under low wind speed or calm conditions and for an experimental area that is usually defined within a generous border in order to strive for homogeneity of the exposure concentrations within the treatment area. They are also dependent on continuous computer-controlled feedback of the ozone concentrations in the mixed treated air and of the meteorological conditions.

2089,14977,8.2,8,2,.,.,.,.,APPENDIX 8 | ECOLOGICAL EFFECTS,Visible Foliar Injury and Biomonitoring,,,,,"Richards et al., 1958","In the 2013 Ozone ISA the evidence was sufficient to conclude that there is a causal relationship between ambient ozone exposure and the occurrence of ozone-induced visible foliar injury on sensitive plant species across the U.S. (U.S. EPA, 2013). Visible foliar injury resulting from exposure to ozone has been well characterized and documented on many tree, shrub, herbaceous, and crop species through research beginning in 1958 (U.S. EPA, 2013, 2006, 1996, 1986, 1978; NAPCA, 1970; Richards et al., 1958). Ozone-induced visible foliar injury on certain plant species is considered diagnostic because such injuries have been verified experimentally in exposure-response studies (see Section 8.1.2.1) and are considered bioindicators for ozone exposure. Typical types of visible injury to broadleaf plants include stippling, flecking, surface bleaching, bifacial necrosis, pigmentation (e.g., bronzing), and chlorosis or premature senescence. Typical visible injury symptoms for conifers include chlorotic banding, tip burn, flecking, chlorotic mottling, and premature senescence of needles. At the time of the 2013 Ozone ISA, it was well understood that, although common patterns of injury develop within a species, these foliar lesions can vary considerably within and among taxonomic groups. A triad of conditions is necessary for visible foliar injury to occur. These conditions include the presence of ozone pollution, genetic susceptibility, and sufficient soil moisture to promote open stomata. In general, plants with higher stomatal conductance, allowing more ozone into the leaf, are more susceptible to injury. A lack of soil moisture generally decreases stomatal conductance. Other factors, such as leaf age and light level, have also been shown to influence the amount of foliar injury."

A major modifying factor for ozone-induced visible foliar injury is the amount of soil moisture available to a plant during the year that the visible foliar injury is being assessed. This is because lack of soil moisture generally decreases stomatal conductance of plants and, therefore, limits the amount of ozone entering the leaf that can cause injury (Matyssek et al., 2006; Panek, 2004; Grulke et al., 2003; Panek and Goldstein, 2001; Temple et al., 1992; Temple et al., 1988). Consequently, many studies have shown that dry periods in local areas tend to decrease the incidence and severity of ozone-induced visible foliar injury; therefore, the incidence of visible foliar injury is not always higher in years and areas with higher ozone, especially with co-occurring drought (Smith, 2012; Smith et al., 2003). In a series of recent studies, researchers have found their spatial models of ozone injury in California improved significantly when GIS variables of plant water status were included (Kefauver et al., 2013; Kefauver et al., 2012b; Kefauver et al., 2012a). In a statistical modeling study, Wang et al. (2012) reported that incorporating ecological factors with ozone exposure and soil moisture improved model predictions of foliar injury in field plots (http://www.fia.fs.fed.us/, 1997-2007) from 24 states in Northeast and North Central U.S."

However, in some cases, visible foliar symptoms have been correlated with decreased vegetative growth (Somers et al., 1998; Karnosky et al., 1996; Peterson et al., 1987; Benoit et al., 1982) and impaired reproductive function (Chappelka, 2002; Black et al., 2000). Conversely, the lack of visible injury does not always indicate a lack of phytotoxic concentrations of ozone or a lack of ozone effects (Gregg et al., 2006, 2003)."

In experiments that used ambient air as the control, average fruit weight decreased 51% (at an avg exposure of 98 ppb), which was the largest effect observed in this part of the meta-analysis, and seed number decreased approximately 10% (at an avg exposure of 68 ppb).

Evergreen hardwoods were the functional type most sensitive to increasing ozone; they showed annual mortality ranging from 1% in areas of the country with relatively low ozone to 3% in areas of relatively high ozone. Assuming no replacement, a change in mortality rate from 1 to 3% would shift the time to 50% loss of a species from 69 to 24 years. Such changes in mortality are consistent with documented changes in community composition (Section 8.10)."

On a regional basis, the highest relative losses for wheat (12%) and soybean (25%) were in the eastern U.S. Kansas produces the most wheat but also experiences the greatest percentage of wheat loss due to ozone. The majority of NOX emissions responsible for ozone-related wheat loss originate in Texas. For soybean, the highest loss occurs in Illinois which is most affected by NOX emissions from Missouri.

This approach takes into consideration strong ozone-temperature covariation and does not rely on pooled concentration-response functions. For all three crops, the revised sensitivities (calculated in latitude-longitude grid cells to account for regional differences in temperature, water, and nutrient availability) are generally higher than previously indicated by concentration-response functions derived from experimental studies. Wheat yield sensitivities to ozone were statistically significant spatially along the northern U.S. border, maize sensitivity was spatially statistically significant at various locations across the U.S., and soybean sensitivity was spatially statistically significant in a band from the Great Plains to the south-central U.S. Crops in regions of elevated ozone and high water use, were more tolerant to ozone.

In this analysis, the CMAQ model was used to model exposure values of W126 and then apply these to crop distribution maps using published data to estimate biomass loss and potential productivity loss (PPL). At ambient ozone concentrations, modeled production loss is greatest for potatoes, soybean, and cotton, with these losses ranging from 1.5 to 1.9%. Scenario 1 (which is closest to current levels) results in an ozone impact reduction of <2% for each crop. Reductions in PPL of 8.4% (soybean) and 6.7% (cotton) in Scenario 2 (which is most similar to the final Clean Power Plan) and 6.6 and 3.8% in Scenario 3 (most stringent policy option) suggest that reduction in NOX with CO2 regulation will decrease agricultural yield losses associated with ozone."

There is a considerable amount of new research on major U.S. crops, especially soybean, wheat, and nonsoybean legumes, including updated soybean exposure-response curves.

Recent advances in characterizing ozone's effects on U.S. crop yield include further geographic and temporal refinement of ozone sensitivity and national-scale estimates of maize and soybean losses from ozone based on actual yield data. A few studies on grassland species add to the existing body of evidence in the 2013 Ozone ISA for ozone effects on nutritive quality.

At the time of the 2013 Ozone ISA, there was evidence from long-term ecosystem-scale ozone fumigation experiments in forests, grasslands, and agricultural systems that ozone exposure could decrease plant productivity. Similarly, the 2013 Ozone ISA included findings from five models that incorporated the negative effects of ozone on leaf-level photosynthesis and plant growth into carbon-cycling models, which were then used to create regional-, national-, or global-scale estimates of the effect of ozone pollution on terrestrial plant productivity and carbon sequestration. Although the models and experiments varied widely in scale and scope, there were consistent observations of decreased plant productivity and a smaller flux of CO2 into ecosystems."

In rice-associated soil, elevated ozone decreased the richness, diversity, and abundance of the methanogenic archaeal community and decreased abundance of the dominant archaeal methanogen Methanosaeta (Zhang et al., 2016; Feng et al., 2013)."

The NCLAN and NHEERL-WED data with exposure measured as W126, was used to derive single-species median models for soybean and aspen from studies involving different genotypes, years, and locations. The resulting models were used to predict the change in yield of soybean and biomass of aspen between the two levels of exposure reported in the later FACE experiments. Results from these new experiments were exceptionally close to predictions from the models (Figure 8-16, Figure 8-17).

(2015),"RF is a perturbation in net radiative flux at the tropopause (or top of the atmosphere) caused by a change in radiatively active forcing agent(s) after stratospheric temperatures have readjusted to radiative equilibrium [stratospherically adjusted RF; Fiore et al. (2015); Myhre et al. (2013)]. It is commonly expressed in units of W/m2. All else being equal, a positive RF results in net warming of the Earth's surface, while negative RF leads to a net cooling. Effective radiative forcing (ERF) accounts for both the effects of the forcing agent and the rapid adjustments to that forcing agent [e.g., atmospheric temperature, cloud cover, water vapor; Myhre et al. (2013)]. While global mean RF and ERF are both important measures of climate response to radiative effects, this assessment focuses on RF as an endpoint, because ozone ERF estimates in the published literature are more limited, and because differences between RF and ERF for tropospheric ozone tend to be small compared to existing uncertainties in RF and ERF (Myhre et al., 2013). The nonuniform distribution of ozone (horizontally, vertically, and temporally) also makes quantifying global and regional ozone RF challenging. Unlike RF estimates for well-mixed GHGs, which can be and are determined from observations at a few surface sites (Myhre et al., 2013), ozone RF estimates are generally calculated using a combination of general circulation model (GCM) radiative transfer parameterization schemes and more detailed line-by-line radiative transfer models. As a result, it is more difficult to provide precise quantitative estimates of the RF associated with changes in surface ozone at regional scales. As noted above, tropospheric ozone RF is estimated to be about 25-40% of the total warming effects of anthropogenic carbon dioxide (CO2) and about 75% of the effects of anthropogenic methane (CH4), globally, ranking ozone third in importance for global climate behind these two major greenhouse gases (Forster et al., 2007)."

(2013),"The AR5 best estimate of tropospheric ozone RF is 0.40 (0.20 to 0.60) W/m2 [from 1750 to 2011; Table 9-2; Shindell et al. (2013); Sovde et al. (2012); Skeie et al. (2011)]. There are uncertainties from inter-model spread across atmospheric models (-0.11 to 0.11 W/m2) and differences between standalone radiative transfer models (-0.07 to 0.07 W/m2), where all ranges represent the 95% confidence intervals (Myhre et al., 2013). One of the largest uncertainties in calculating ozone RF is estimating ozone concentrations in preindustrial times.

Ozone and its precursors exert a strong control on the oxidizing capacity of the troposphere, thereby affecting the lifetime of CH4 and other gases (Derwent et al., 2001), with further implications for RF and climate. CO and VOC emissions exert an overall positive RF (warming) by increasing tropospheric ozone and CH4 concentrations.

Such ozone effects trends will also depend on changes in a suite of climate-sensitive factors, such as the water vapor content of the atmosphere. From the 2013 Ozone ISA: ""Several studies have included tropospheric ozone in their investigations of the response in the future atmosphere to a suite of short-lived species [e.g., Levy et al. (2008); Shindell et al. (2008); Shindell et al. (2007)]. Few studies, however, have calculated the climate response to changes in tropospheric ozone concentrations alone in the future atmosphere."" This conclusion remains the case with the current literature (Myhre et al., 2013)."

Specifically, ozone changes are understood to have impacts on other climate metrics such as precipitation and atmospheric circulation patterns, and new evidence has continued to support and further quantify this understanding. This new evidence is limited to a relatively small number of studies, however, leaving various uncertainties still to be resolved. While less work has been done on ozone, recent work on understanding impacts on precipitation from other heterogeneously distributed radiative forcers, such as aerosols (Liu et al., 2018; Westervelt et al., 2018), could improve estimates of ozone RF effects on precipitation going forward."

Using simple model calculations of the time-dependent precipitation change due to an RF perturbation, Macintosh et al. (2016) found that the contribution of ozone change from 1765-2011 to precipitation change over that period could exceed 50% of that due to CO2 change (including both stratospheric and tropospheric ozone, though the bulk of the RF change is from tropospheric ozone). Shindell et al. (2012b) also found that both ozone and aerosol RF typically induce larger precipitation responses than the equivalent CO2 forcing, and that these spatially heterogeneous forcers are therefore potentially disruptive to the hydrologic cycle at regional scales."
